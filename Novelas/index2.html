<p>Vera’s body flinched. His gaze began to scan Renee with a worried expression.</p>
<p><i>Is it really okay like this?</i> Such thoughts continued to linger in his head.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Renee ate the food bit by bit with a satisfied face and let out an exclamation.</p>
<p>“The seafood is really delicious!”</p>
<p>It was an exclamation that arose because the seafood that she had never tasted before was very delicious and perfectly suited to her taste.</p>
<p>Vera also nodded with a satisfied face.</p>
<p>“Yes, it must have been very difficult to keep them fresh all the way to the center of the continent, but the seafood is definitely in good condition.”</p>
<p>“Ah, have you eaten it before, Vera?”</p>
<p>“I have been to the seaside before.”</p>
<p>“Woah…”</p>
<p>An exclamation escaped from Renee’s lips. Then, a question popped up.</p>
<p>“What is the sea like?”</p>
<p>Having lived in Remeo all her life and only recently stepped out into the world for the first time from the Holy Kingdom, it was a question that naturally arose in Renee’s curious mind.</p>
<p>Vera pondered. It was always challenging to describe the scenery in a way that Renee could understand and relate to.</p>
<p>“…First of all, the air is salty. Due to the strong wind, that salty air constantly brushes against your face. Initially, it feels good, but it can become irritating as time goes on. There is a long stretch of sandy beach, and beyond that, the sea shimmering in a deep blue color along the horizon. The area where the sandy beach meets the sea forms a foamy, bright white color. I remember staring at that foam when I went to the sea.”</p>
<p>Curiosity intensified across Renee’s face.</p>
<p>“I can’t quite understand how the air can be ‘salty’.”</p>
<p>“Literally, it smells salty when you breathe.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Vera looked at Renee’s complexion for a moment but was taken aback by Renee, who had leaned over and resumed speaking.</p>
<p>“…Would you like to go there after visiting the Academy? Coincidentally, there’s a beach not far from the Academy.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sounds good!”</p>
<p>Renee’s face brightened, and Vera felt a tight sensation in his chest.</p>
<p>That smile caught everyone’s attention, and he couldn’t sense anything else in his surroundings—a strange sensation.</p>
<p>Even when he tried to compose himself, his irrational emotions which consistently defied logic, continued to be directed towards her.</p>
<p>He let out a long breath.</p>
<p>Considering his emotions to be somewhat distorted, Vera tried to suppress the tremor within himself, but at that moment, someone approached the two of them.</p>
<p>“Are you enjoying the banquet?”</p>
<p>It was Maximilian.</p>
<p>With a cocktail in one hand, he spoke in the most dignified tone she had ever heard. Renee responded with a smile.</p>
<p>“Yes, the seafood is really delicious.”</p>
<p>“It’s the best work of this year. Coincidentally, the freezer that we operated for a trial run performed excellently. Thanks to that, we were able to bring seafood all the way inland while maintaining its freshness.”</p>
<p>“Freez… Ah, is it a magical engineering product?”</p>
<p>“Exactly. Although, it will still take a few more years before it can be commercialized.”</p>
<p>Renee burst out a ‘pfft’ at Maximilian’s words. It was because the pride that could be felt in his words was so evident.</p>
<p>“I see, Your Highness the Crown Prince is very interested in magic engineering.”</p>
<p>“Of course. They are objects that affect the level of civilization of the entire country. So, isn’t it natural to drool at them from a ruler’s perspective? No matter how much it is said that it is the nobles who lead the Empire, the nation’s power eventually comes from its population. The means to secure the labor force are…”</p>
<p>At that moment, Maximilian, who had been talking for a long time, abruptly stopped and cleared his throat before apologizing.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. I tend to get carried away whenever I talk about this.”</p>
<p>“No, I think it’s great. You always do your best in your work.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for your understanding.”</p>
<p>A warm atmosphere ensued. It seemed Renee was happy to have eaten seafood for the first time in her life, and more fundamentally, a peaceful time with Vera continued. On the other hand, Maximilian seemed happy to have safely completed his brother’s coming-of-age ceremony.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for the coming-of-age ceremony. I never imagined that the Saint would use such a trick.”</p>
<p>“…Pardon?”</p>
<p>“Your power, I mean. Didn’t you stake my brother the fate of a guardian? Thanks to that, there’s less noise. While there were still people who said my brother should be the Crown Prince, the blessing put an end to that discussion, allowing us to eliminate all the noise related to the throne.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>“Hm? Wasn’t that your intention?”</p>
<p>Renee’s body twitched.</p>
<p>‘I just said whatever came to mind.’</p>
<p>…The thought that saying those words seemed somewhat awkward crossed her mind.</p>
<p>“R-right?”</p>
<p>In the end, she managed to say something vague.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Maximilian didn’t catch onto anything and nodded his head.</p>
<p>“Well then, I’ll take my leave. I hope I haven’t detained you for too long.”</p>
<p>“No, well…”</p>
<p>“Take your time and enjoy yourselves before leaving.”</p>
<p>Maximilian walked away.</p>
<p>Only then did Renee let out a breath, then scratched her cheek as if troubled.</p>
<p>“Hm, I hadn’t thought of that again.”</p>
<p>“As politics is done through words, there are those who take them sensitively. It’s nothing to be concerned about. After all, it’s an internal matter of the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Right?”</p>
<p>Renee chuckled.</p>
<p>Renee, who was about to resume eating, paused her hand at a sudden thought and turned her head towards Vera, speaking in a playful tone.</p>
<p>“But in the end, it wasn’t excessive.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Using my power. It’s a statement based on the outcome, but it helped resolve things better, right?”</p>
<p>She was talking about what Vera had said right after the coming-of-age ceremony, that it was too much to also use her power.</p>
<p>Vera shut his mouth at that.</p>
<p>“Vera is wrong this time.”</p>
<p>He felt pissed off at her words accompanied by giggles. Vera refuted in a very blunt tone.</p>
<p>“…It could have been right. If only the content of the blessing had changed a little.”</p>
<p>“But what can you do? The content has already been determined.”</p>
<p>“The second time is unpredictable. When using that power, one must always be cautious…”</p>
<p>“But Vera seems to make an oath for everything. Even for a trivial thing, ‘I’ll make an oath’. And also ‘If you can’t believe me, I’ll make an oath’, like that. That’s not something Vera should say.”</p>
<p><b><i>Why is she so aggressive?</i></b></p>
<p>Looking at Renee’s complexion with such a thought in mind, Vera let out a grumbling sound at her face full of mischief and expressed his will to surrender.</p>
<p>“…Yes, the Saint is right.”</p>
<p>It was a declaration of defeat that couldn’t completely hide the traces of his anger. That eventually caused Renee to burst into laughter.</p>
<p>The awkwardness and embarrassment that lingered before entering the ballroom had already disappeared.</p>
<p>The lively atmosphere, being able to taste seafood for the first time in her life, and the brief conversation with Maximilian had a positive effect.</p>
<p>Now that she could finally face Vera with a little more ease and with a reliable suit that covered her flimsy dress, Renee spoke with a broad smile.</p>
<p>“Vera is generous with himself, while being strict with others.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Vera felt troubled for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>It was a feeling that arose because Renee, who had responded positively to most things, was joking around like this.</p>
<p>She had changed recently.</p>
<p>Did the events in the Empire bring about a change in her?</p>
<p>When he thought about that, he felt sad yet proud for some reason at her gradually changing appearance… but the most prominent emotion right now was the bitterness of being stabbed like this.</p>
<p>“…I will correct it.”</p>
<p>“Are you making an oath for that, too?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Vera’s voice sharpened a little.</p>
<p>For some reason, Renee felt a pleasant feeling arising from that nuance.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was carried away by the atmosphere.</p>
<p>A different place than usual. People. And herself.</p>
<p>Amidst it all, she felt a sense of pride in herself for not feeling ashamed, unlike Annie’s concerns.</p>
<p>In addition, Vera, who didn’t change in the midst of this, was lovely… Such shameful thoughts also come to her mind.</p>
<p>‘Ugh…’</p>
<p>The heat rose.</p>
<p><b><i>It’s probably because we’re indoors. Since the air is hot, my body is also getting hot. That must be it.</i></b></p>
<p>Renee sat down, moistening her lips to alleviate the rising heat.</p>
<p>Just like that, some time passed.</p>
<p>“…The music has changed.”</p>
<p>A slightly slow and low-pitched melody tickled their ears.</p>
<p>In line with the soft rhythm, the footsteps that had been audible until just a moment ago began to take on a slightly relaxed form.</p>
<p>Laughter echoed in their ears.</p>
<p>Watching people dancing in the middle of the ballroom, Vera unintentionally blurted out such words.</p>
<p>“Would you like to dance to a song?”</p>
<p>Only after speaking did his body tremble, and a look of dismay arose along with it. It was because of the thought that he spoke out of emotion.</p>
<p>“Hm… I would like to, but I can’t dance. I can’t even learn.”</p>
<p>Perhaps it should be considered fortunate for Vera, because Renee was delighted by his suggestion.</p>
<p>Just the act of suggesting to do something together was already enough to bring happiness to her.</p>
<p>It didn’t occur to her that it was rude to ask a blind woman to dance. She was well aware of what kind of person Vera was.</p>
<p>Vera was someone who didn’t let her blindness define his judgment of other aspects.</p>
<p>He was someone who saw her as Renee, not a blind woman.</p>
<p>He was someone who looked at what was inside, not the flawed body.</p>
<p>…And that’s why Renee liked him.</p>
<p>“Hm, this is a bit of a pity.”</p>
<p>As she uttered these words with a chuckle, Vera’s expression became clouded.</p>
<p>Vera wanted Renee to experience more things and be happier.</p>
<p>Wasn’t his oath for that? The oath he made in the hopes that her life would be full of happiness and that the light that awakened him from his darkest moments, from his evil self, would never fade.</p>
<p>Therefore, Vera didn’t want her to vent her regret over something she couldn’t do.</p>
<p>For that reason, he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“…You can.”</p>
<p>If there’s something she couldn’t do, he would make it possible for her.</p>
<p>He would do everything she wanted so that even the word ‘if’ could become a funny joke.</p>
<p>He would live for that purpose.</p>
<p>Since he had already promised her in Remeo.</p>
<p>Vera spoke in a quiet tone.</p>
<p>“You can dance.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“It’s possible as long as I take the lead. Luckily, it’s slow-tempo music. If you follow my lead, you will be able to dance safely.”</p>
<p>Vera rose from his seat and gently helped Renee up. Renee asked with a bewildered expression.</p>
<p>“W-Will it be alright? What if I step on your foot…?”</p>
<p>“That’s alright.”</p>
<p>Vera dismissed Renee’s concerns as if they were insignificant.</p>
<p>“After all, dancing is about using the body. And I’m confident that I can do it better than anyone else in the world when it comes to using my body.”</p>
<p>Since he had something he was confident in more than anything else, Vera was not worried.</p>
<p>The two slowly headed towards the center. One hand interlocked, and the other wrapped around each other’s shoulder and waist.</p>
<p>With careful movements, Vera led Renee.</p>
<p>As the two moved, people cleared the way. They had gazes full of curiosity and pleasure.</p>
<p>In the middle of the ballroom, Vera tapped his foot, creating a distinct ‘tap’ sound, and opened his lips.</p>
<p>“Slowly, let’s turn clockwise first.”</p>
<p>In a distance where their breaths entangled with each other…</p>
<p>Renee nodded, feeling the heat that had been within her all along turn into an inferno.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 114: Ball (4)</p>
<p>In the center of the hall, where a slow melody resonated and spread, Renee followed Vera’s lead and waltzed slowly.</p>
<p>Her left foot moved toward their clasped hands, followed by her right foot. She then spun around.</p>
<p>“Good job. Now, breathe and take four steps, one at a time, starting with your right foot. Once you’ve done that, turn counterclockwise.”</p>
<p>Vera’s voice blended in with the music.</p>
<p>As Vera’s touch guided Renee, the rhythmic sound of two footsteps merged with the melody.</p>
<p>She could feel the train of her dress unfurled as she moved, creating a sound that blended in with the music.</p>
<p>For a moment, Renee felt a strange sensation as if she were walking on top of the melody.</p>
<p>The space became a sheet of music, their footsteps became musical notes, and the empty score was filled by Renee and Vera’s movements.</p>
<p>Their breaths collided. Their intertwined breath whirled along the movements before dissipating. The lingering moisture bounced off at the sound of footsteps. They shifted their position again, and the cycle repeated itself until Vera’s low voice echoed softly.</p>
<p>“You can now go in any direction you want. If you think you’re about to bump into someone or go outside the hall, I’ll adjust your direction, so don’t worry and go anywhere you want.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>Her voice sounded like she was lost in a dream.</p>
<p><b><i>No, maybe it is really just a dream.</i></b></p>
<p>Renee danced in a state of stupor the entire time, enthralled by how fluid her footwork was and stunned by how she could spin to the beat of the music.</p>
<p>A thought occurred to her.</p>
<p>Vera, just as he had said, was very good at controlling the body.</p>
<p>How could she not think of that? Even a blind woman who couldn’t move anywhere without a cane was able to go anywhere with his guidance, and it occurred to her that no one was as talented at controlling the body as Vera.</p>
<p>Wherever Vera’s touch landed, it felt as scorching as fire.</p>
<p>Their entangled breaths were a bit strange.</p>
<p>As the dance continued, their recurrent closing and widening distance felt very excruciating to her.</p>
<p>‘…Oh, maybe I can pretend to fall now.’</p>
<p>The thought crossed her mind, but she quickly dismissed it.</p>
<p>If their poise falters, so will the mood. This moment would come to an end.</p>
<p>Renee thought she’d be happier if she let this moment last a bit longer rather than clinging to him so tightly, so she let her body move loosely.</p>
<p>Her blindness was no obstacle to Renee at this moment.</p>
<p>She had Vera, whom she could feel even without seeing, and she had two feet that could take her anywhere without a cane, so not being able to see was the least of her problems.</p>
<p>No, it would be more accurate to say that her inability to see became a source of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, she could feel Vera even more clearly.</p>
<p>Renee thought to herself.</p>
<p>An emotional echo, that might be much closer to a reverie than logic, began to weave its way into words.</p>
<p>Perhaps the Gods took away her light because meeting Vera came at a price, and that light was the required price the poor rural farmer’s daughter had to pay in order to meet Vera.</p>
<p>Her lips curved into a smile.</p>
<p>Her thundering chest had mellowed and settled into a faint, vibrating tremor.</p>
<p>‘How cheap.’</p>
<p>She reflected on how cheap it was.</p>
<p>To think that by giving just a single light, she obtained an irreplaceable treasure, and she became the light that Vera desired.</p>
<p>The thought of getting him at a really low price made her happy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After one song that only lasted at least eight minutes, Renee returned to her spot on the corner.</p>
<p>“…Thank you.”</p>
<p>Words of gratitude came out.</p>
<p>She was very grateful to Vera for allowing her to experience something she could never have imagined before, and she was only able to say it now because she had no chance when she was too preoccupied with dancing at the time. To which Vera replied, as if there was no big deal.</p>
<p>“Of course. It is my duty to listen to anything the Saint wishes.”</p>
<p>Renee felt a faint smile flicker across her face at the words.</p>
<p>‘Anything.’</p>
<p><b><i>Does he realize the weight of that word?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Did he say it because he really doesn’t know what I really want?</i></b></p>
<p>As a bitter feeling emerged inside, Renee jokingly said.</p>
<p>“Will you give me a star, then?”</p>
<p>“I will do my best to-”</p>
<p>“Forget it. I’m just kidding.”</p>
<p>Hehe. Renee let out a giggle and leaned back in her seat. Their hands were still clasped together.</p>
<p>The warmth from their bodies still remained. It was transmitted to Vera through the pulse, just as Vera’s warmth transmitted to her.</p>
<p>Renee’s smile widened as she fumbled with his hand.</p>
<p>‘…Vera is the same.’</p>
<p>Vera’s heartbeat synchronized with her own.</p>
<p>Whether it was just their heartbeat that were in sync or if it extended to their hearts… She didn’t know.</p>
<p>Renee concluded that ‘their hearts are synchronized’ and lowered her head.</p>
<p>Her cheeks were burning.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just her cheeks, but her whole body.</p>
<p>“…It’s hot.”</p>
<p><b><i>What in the world happened to this place to be this hot?</i></b></p>
<p>When she blamed the innocent ballroom, Vera studied Renee’s complexion and replied.</p>
<p>“I think it’s because you’ve moved more than usual. Would you like to step out onto the terrace for a moment?”</p>
<p>The terrace.</p>
<p>Renee hesitated for a moment before nodding, and Vera escorted her out.</p>
<p>Renee’s heart began to swell with emotions as she held Vera’s hand and walked slowly, so she zipped her mouth shut.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the words that she had held in for so long would burst out. Even though she was perplexed as to why she was so emotional today, she had thoughts that concerned her.</p>
<p>There were questions arising from the word ‘maybe’.</p>
<p><b><i>Maybe it’s today.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Maybe it’s the day I should let go of everything that has been piling up by being with him every day?</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>Maybe I won’t be able to express myself for a long time after today.</i></b></p>
<p>Those thoughts continue to run through her mind.</p>
<p>It was something akin to intuition.</p>
<p>Like most people, Renee was drawn to a weird intuition that logic couldn’t explain.</p>
<p>Renee made a decision with a determined expression.</p>
<p>‘…I have to do it.’</p>
<p>It had to be today.</p>
<p><b><i>Today, I must confess, right in this place.</i></b></p>
<p>But, oddly enough, even though she was shaken by such feelings, her shyness refused to fade at any cost.</p>
<p>Renee chewed on her lip, feeling a mixture of dismay and anger.</p>
<p>‘…No.’</p>
<p><b><i>This won’t do.</i></b></p>
<p>Renee, who had this idea in mind, raised her hand gently.</p>
<p>She reached out toward the sound of a passing servant along with a ripple of water.</p>
<p>“Saint?”</p>
<p>Vera called. Renee ignored him and talked to the servant.</p>
<p>“Can I have a cocktail, please?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes!”</p>
<p>The servant handed her a glass in a bewildered voice, and Renee took it.</p>
<p>Vera’s expression was filled with shock.</p>
<p>“Saint, that…”</p>
<p>“It’s only one glass. I’ll be alright.”</p>
<p>She felt she couldn’t do it in her sober state, so she wanted assistance from it.</p>
<p>Vera closed his eyes firmly as Renee drank the cocktail in one gulp.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On a small terrace with a single bench.</p>
<p>Vera took Renee there, seated her down, and then questioned her with a look of concern.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Such a question came up as he recalled what happened the day Renee had her first drink. Who could forget the incident in which she lost her mind and spiraled out of control after just one cup?</p>
<p><b><i>What if she starts crying again</i></b><b>?</b></p>
<p>Vera’s face grew stiff as his thoughts went in that direction.</p>
<p>“I’m alright.”</p>
<p>Renee added with a light smile.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ve got it under control with my divinity.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a bluff.</p>
<p>She wasn’t going to make the same mistake again, so she drove out her drunkenness, leaving just enough to keep her tipsy.</p>
<p>‘Don’t tell me he still thinks I suck at controlling it?’</p>
<p>Renee thought and chuckled at Vera for treating her like a complete amateur.</p>
<p>Vera exhaled a sigh of relief when Renee behaved in an orderly manner.</p>
<p>“…Because I did not teach you that in particular.”</p>
<p>“I’m not the Saint for nothing. I can manage my divinity just as well as Vera. All I did was think about what I wanted to do and it flashed into my head naturally.”</p>
<p>Vera laughed at her snobbish remark.</p>
<p>“That’s impressive.”</p>
<p>“You’re not being sarcastic, are you?”</p>
<p>“I have no idea about that.”</p>
<p>“What a smooth comeback. You always have the upper hand in conversations, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“I know that I’m a man of my word, except for a few times.”</p>
<p>“That is exactly the problem.”</p>
<p>Renee inwardly cheered as her words flowed effortlessly from her tongue.</p>
<p><b><i>Is drinking the answer, after all?</i></b></p>
<p>The shyness that had always tormented her did not rear its ugly head.</p>
<p>“When you feel the need to go all out, you screw everything else, be it promises and whatnot.”</p>
<p>Vera kept his mouth shut.</p>
<p>Vera threw a glance at Renee, wondering whether she was trying to hide her drunkenness from him.</p>
<p>But when he gazed at the pale skin beneath the lights, his initial intention to check for signs of drunkenness vanished, and he wound up staring blankly into Renee’s face.</p>
<p>Vera belatedly snapped out of it with a tremble.</p>
<p>“Are you cold?”</p>
<p>Renee asked as she felt it through her palm, and Vera promptly replied.</p>
<p>“My discipline isn’t shallow enough to be affected by the heat or cold.”</p>
<p>“What’s with the sudden bragging?”</p>
<p>“…I wanted to say that you don’t have to worry.”</p>
<p>Renee laughed when Vera lost his cool and asked him another question.</p>
<p>“Do you find me difficult, Vera?”</p>
<p>“…What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I mean, even when dealing with other Apostles, Aisha, and even the Crown Prince, you are indifferent or irritable, but you are always obedient to me.”</p>
<p>“It’s…”</p>
<p>“Because I’m the light?”</p>
<p>No reply came back.</p>
<p><b><i> Is it because I’m drunk?</i></b></p>
<p>Renee felt her long-suppressed heartache begin to rear its ugly head because of Vera’s attitude, and she continued pressing him with more questions.</p>
<p>“You know… What am I to you if I’m not the light?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”</p>
<p>“What if I’m Renee and not the Saint? What if I’m stripped of my power, status, and the light that Vera has been searching so desperately…”</p>
<p>It was the question that always lurked in the back of her mind.</p>
<p>She knew she was just being whiny, and it was obvious that the answer would make no difference.</p>
<p>She buried her heartache because she thought it was better to keep it buried and feign ignorance.</p>
<p>“…I, who is stripped of everything, what am I to Vera?”</p>
<p>The stupor caused her words to flow freely and brought out her deepest feelings.</p>
<p>That created a ripple in Vera’s heart. It began to manifest, causing Vera’s body to shake uncontrollably.</p>
<p>Renee clenched Vera’s trembling hand tightly and said.</p>
<p>“Vera is Vera to me. Not my knight, Apostle, villain, nor savior. You’re just Vera.”</p>
<p>She raised their intertwined hand and placed it on her cheek.</p>
<p>“Vera is simply the one who holds my hand. That’s why…”</p>
<p>Her embarrassment reared its ugly head again.</p>
<p>She couldn’t stop herself from losing it when the alcohol took effect, driving her over the edge.</p>
<p>Renee furrowed her brows at how much it irked her and bit her lips before pouring out the words that had been lodged in her throat.</p>
<p>“…That’s why I like Vera.”</p>
<p>Her voice quivered from her last surge of embarrassment.</p>
<p>Renee thought her words were not enough to express her feelings, so she added further.</p>
<p>“I don’t mean like or dislikes. I like <i>you</i>, but in a different way…”</p>
<p>She rubbed her face against the palm that rested on her cheek.</p>
<p>At that moment, Renee noticed that Vera’s stiff response was more than just confusion or discomfort.</p>
<p>There was a glimmer of hope, anticipation, and thirst.</p>
<p>So she did it.</p>
<p>“How does Vera feel about me?”</p>
<p>It was an irreversible question.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 115: Coming of Age Ceremony</p>
<p>At Renee’s consecutive questions, the first thing that came to Vera’s mind was ‘The time has come’.</p>
<p>This was because whether it was Renee’s heart, or the meaning behind her words, he already knew it all.</p>
<p><i>Wasn’t it too obvious? </i>He thought.</p>
<p>Renee’s signals and emotions were too obvious for them to be hidden easily.</p>
<p>Despite knowing this, Vera turned a blind eye to it.</p>
<p>It didn’t feel appropriate to respond positively, and he wasn’t sure how it would affect her.</p>
<p>He made every effort to look away and distance himself from her, but these things were inevitably being brought before him.</p>
<p>Vera felt a pang of sadness in his heart.</p>
<p>“Saint…”</p>
<p>“Please say it.”</p>
<p>Renee’s face turned even redder, and her warmth was transferred to Vera through the palm of her hand.</p>
<p>Looking at her, the answer instantly came to him.</p>
<p>However, Vera ditched the sentence rising in his head before he could even finish it.</p>
<p>‘…I must reject her.’</p>
<p>He must do that. He might have a bad impact on Renee. She might not be able to light up the world or even herself.</p>
<p>Vera licked his lips with a horribly contorted expression.</p>
<p>…But no words came out.</p>
<p>Because logic and emotion had a different basis of judgment, different interpretations of what is deemed right, and because Vera had always been a greedy person, he couldn’t suppress his emotions with logic.</p>
<p>So, he started spitting out words that hid what he couldn’t say.</p>
<p>“…I am an evil man.”</p>
<p>“Are you bringing that up again?”</p>
<p>“Please listen.”</p>
<p>Renee closed her mouth shut. Looking at her, Vera breathed deeply and continued.</p>
<p>“I liked taking care of things efficiently, and that efficiency doesn’t consider morals. As a result, each time I run into a problem, I turn to violence to solve it.”</p>
<p>“Vera didn’t do things like that.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I didn’t do that. To be exact, I haven’t done such a thing since I met the Saint.”</p>
<p>It was more like his inner fear had prevented him from committing it.</p>
<p>“Now that I know it’s wrong, it often crosses my mind, but I never act on it. However, that doesn’t imply that my thoughts are completely gone. The tendency to consider doing wicked things first in any situation will not go away.”</p>
<p>Vera knew himself well.</p>
<p>He knew just how wicked he was, and how deep and filthy his heart was.</p>
<p>He knew enough of himself to be afraid.</p>
<p>“I have a fear. Maybe someday I’ll succumb to my evil thoughts without realizing it. What if the action I took, which I judged as good, was actually evil? Because of that fear, I have to suppress my emotions.”</p>
<p>Since he made emotional judgments that were too despicable and couldn’t distinguish between good and evil, he needed a universal good and its embodiment to make judgments.</p>
<p>He was a man who had to entrust his judgment to that embodiment.</p>
<p>“For that reason, I don’t want to tarnish you with my color. I was afraid that my evil thoughts might be passed on to you and cause you to mistake my wickedness for kindness, so I didn’t want to express how I felt.”</p>
<p>Renee could feel the sincerity in his tone when Vera was speaking.</p>
<p>It made her sad.</p>
<p>“…Everyone has evil thoughts. What matters is whether you act on it or not.”</p>
<p>“I’m not fine with that.”</p>
<p>Vera immediately cut off Renee’s words.</p>
<p>“I really want to learn how to think positively and always put decency first while dealing with situations. I’m not fine with that.”</p>
<p>Vera bowed his head.</p>
<p>“…Please don’t put me to the test.”</p>
<p>The long-winded rejection ended in a desperate plea.</p>
<p>Renee felt the warmth that had been enveloping her diminish.</p>
<p>The urgency in his words and the sadness began to subdue the excitement in her heart.</p>
<p>Feeling like she was about to burst into tears, she tried to argue back since she couldn’t accept the situation.</p>
<p>“I don’t get tarnished that easily.”</p>
<p>She poured her heart out and her deep-seated feelings, which she held dear for a long time.</p>
<p>She refused to back down.</p>
<p>“If Vera is having evil thoughts, I can just pinch you. That’s possible if we know each other better. But why does Vera only think that I’m going to be tarnished by him?”</p>
<p>It was an inquisitive remark, and the answer came back shortly.</p>
<p>“…Because the Saint is too young.”</p>
<p>The words were akin to sharp daggers.</p>
<p><b><i>Young.</i></b></p>
<p>Renee felt stuffy because his abstruse answer sparked questions she hadn’t intended on asking and questions she had put off since he couldn’t instantly reply.</p>
<p>Renee’s face crumpled into a frown. A sharp pain shot through her as she bit her lip hard enough to hear a crunching sound.</p>
<p>She let all of her swirling emotions out as she opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“…Compared to whom?”</p>
<p><i>Flinch—!</i></p>
<p>Vera’s hand, which touched her cheek, flinched greatly. At that moment, Renee was struck by a belated realization.</p>
<p>‘…It was the past.’</p>
<p><b><i>What the Orgus showed me turned out to be the past. The person whom Vera truly cherished, the gut-wrenching cries that I saw, were all in the past.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>…Vera’s first light turns out to be someone else.</i></b></p>
<p>“Who is Vera looking at?”</p>
<p>Her voice trembled.</p>
<p>She let go of the hand that had been resting on her cheek.</p>
<p>“Who are you seeing through me?”</p>
<p>The excitement she had left was ripped apart and replaced by an unfathomable despair.</p>
<p>Although she was unsure of the exact reason, there was something she could ascertain.</p>
<p>The reason why Vera had been so devoted to her since they first met.</p>
<p>It was because there was someone Vera had tried to see through her and through her title as the Saint.</p>
<p>Vera was aware of her feelings and deliberately chose not to acknowledge them.</p>
<p>“…Are you sure you’re looking at me?”</p>
<p>Renee’s sadness was fueled by anger.</p>
<p>She hated Vera, who stayed silent, so much that she spat out words full of anger.</p>
<p>“Vera.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Answer me.”</p>
<p>Vera felt his heart sink at her sudden outburst.</p>
<p><b><i>Did Renee find out something? What is she implying now?</i></b></p>
<p>It was everything he feared.</p>
<p>Vera, who wore a confused expression as he was pressured to answer, barely uttered words with his head down.</p>
<p>“…I’m looking.”</p>
<p>Just like a child being reprimanded by his mother, he replied as if he was trying to get away from the problem.</p>
<p>“I am… looking at the Saint.”</p>
<p>His voice trembled as he spoke.</p>
<p>Of course, his opponent was none other than Renee, who was able to feel the tremble in his voice and sense his nervousness.</p>
<p>“…Vera is a really bad person.”</p>
<p>A teardrop fell from Renee’s eyes. Vera, who belatedly raised his head, widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Sain…”</p>
<p>“You know what? I can clearly feel that Vera is lying right now.”</p>
<p>Renee continued in an exasperated tone.</p>
<p>“Vera didn’t look at me earlier. From the moment I asked who you were seeing through me, Vera’s gaze went elsewhere.”</p>
<p>Whether it is small noise, movement, or a heartbeat. She was able to capture all of that, and that was why she could be sure.</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, Renee felt a bitter taste in her lips, which she had unknowingly chewed.</p>
<p><b><i>It’s probably torn. This bitter taste must be blood.</i></b></p>
<p>“It’s been three and half years.”</p>
<p>It was his turn to speak, but Renee went on speaking before he could do that.</p>
<p>“That’s how long I’ve been liking Vera. It’s always been Vera from the first time we met.”</p>
<p>There was something she wanted to say.</p>
<p>“Even if Vera only saw me as a child and pretended not to know my feelings, even if I knew that, but still…”</p>
<p>Despite the heartbreak, Renee held onto the desire to hold on to Vera, so she didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“…I will always like Vera.”</p>
<p>She simply conveyed her feelings.</p>
<p>Vera’s eyes may have been drawn to someone else first, but it wouldn’t hold his interest forever.</p>
<p>Vera’s heartbeat, warmth, and the time spent with her were not lies.</p>
<p><b><i>If so, I shouldn’t give up.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I’m not going to let despair get the better of me.</i></b></p>
<p>Having made such a promise to herself, Renee could not allow herself to be deterred by such a mere rejection.</p>
<p>She extended her arms. Fortunately, Renee was able to reach Vera due to their close distance.</p>
<p>Putting both hands on Vera’s cheeks, Renee spoke.</p>
<p>“So look at me. I’m the light that you’re obsessed with. Now your light wants you. Look at me.”</p>
<p>She inched her head closer so that only she filled Vera’s vision, and so he couldn’t see anything else except her.</p>
<p>“Look at me as Renee, not as the Saint or the Apostle of the Lord.”</p>
<p>As they were within a hair’s breadth of having their noses touch, she asked again.</p>
<p>”Then answer me again.”</p>
<p>She knew that she made Vera’s heart flutter.</p>
<p>“Do you love me?”</p>
<p>It was a pressure disguised as a question.</p>
<p>What followed next was silence. However, Renee knew.</p>
<p>Vera wouldn’t answer. He was so captivated by her, yet he continued to ignore her.</p>
<p>Vera himself had come clean about the reason and provided an explanation in a very Vera-like way.</p>
<p>Renee could understand that, but that didn’t mean that she would back down.</p>
<p>After three and a half years of waiting, her thirst had grown so intense to the point it was unbearable.</p>
<p>Renee leaned her head even more in and cocked her head sideways.</p>
<p>And their lips met with a ‘chu’ sound.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, their breaths entwined, and their saliva slipped back and forth, tasting like blood.</p>
<p>Then, as if it truly had a great impact on her, she felt an electrifying sensation that rushed up her spine.</p>
<p>Her fingertips felt Vera become stiff as a stone.</p>
<p>“Puha…”</p>
<p>Renee pulled away just enough for their lips to part, and spoke the following words directly into Vera’s mouth.</p>
<p>“…You weren’t going to answer, were you? So I did as I pleased.”</p>
<p>She spoke as though she intended to impose her own desires on Vera.</p>
<p>It was by force.</p>
<p>“Since Vera rejected me as he pleased, I will do as I please. You said you were scared to tarnish me because I’m too young, didn’t you? Then how about this?”</p>
<p>As if saying ‘just wait and see’, she curled up the corners of her lips into an arrogant smile and continued.</p>
<p>”I will color Vera in my own color. I’m going to turn Vera into a fool. I’ll make you only think of me so that you won’t have time to think about evil thoughts or good thoughts.”</p>
<p>Vera’s pupils shook slightly.</p>
<p>“Saint…”</p>
<p>As soon as he was about to answer, Renee kissed him again.</p>
<p>Their breaths entwined again for the second time. Vera felt like his whole body was burning with it. He felt his rational mind fading away, leaving only instinct in its place.</p>
<p>He felt the fear that had settled inside him growing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>The moment it became unbearable, Renee took off her lips.</p>
<p>“…Don’t refute. Don’t even think of rejecting me. I’ll wait especially for you. I won’t bring this up again until Vera tells me he loves me.”</p>
<p>Renee gasped for breath, her body was burning as if she was sweating despite the cold weather, and she was dizzy from her intoxication.</p>
<p>She declared that she would never back down.</p>
<p>“Instead, I’ll make it unbearable for Vera if he doesn’t say it. I’m going to kiss, hug, or say embarrassing things like this. If you want me to stop, you can just say ‘I love you’ to me.”</p>
<p>Renee thought to herself.</p>
<p><b><i>Maybe I’ll tear the blanket out of shame tomorrow.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>I’m sure I would, because I’m half drunk now.</i></b></p>
<p><b><i>But I won’t regret it.</i></b></p>
<p>“If you really want me to turn into a brilliant light, just nod your head. Because your light needs you. It needs you to be complete. That light has given you an order.”</p>
<p>Vera was her envisioned future, her reason to become a brilliant light, her reason to venture into the world, and the reason she loved both herself and other people.</p>
<p>“And don’t ever think about saying the same thing. I’m not a child that you should take care of. I can judge good and evil on my own.”</p>
<p>She wouldn’t regret it because Vera was the reason she set her mind to move forward.</p>
<p>“Hurry, nod.”</p>
<p>She urged him once again.</p>
<p>Renee smiled when Vera, who briefly flinched, began to nod very slowly.</p>
<p>“Good job.”</p>
<p>Renee caressed Vera’s cheek before hugging him.</p>
<p>“Don’t ever call me young again.”</p>
<p>She whispered while holding him in her arms.</p>
<p>Even in the midst of pouring out her feelings, she kept stumbling over her words, and said in a fit of annoyance.</p>
<p>“Vera is much more like a child in my eyes.”</p>
<p>The past was irrelevant anyway. She was the one who had been and will continue to be by Vera’s side. Eventually, Vera would be hers.</p>
<p>In an effort to keep Vera from leaving, Renee hugged him tightly while speaking softly so that only her scent would linger in Vera’s body.</p>
<p>“Vera’s light is already bright enough to move forward on its own. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>The words served as a consolation for Vera and words of encouragement for herself.</p>
<p>She vowed not to give in and to do whatever it took to win him over.</p>
<p>On a very small terrace, Renee hugged Vera in the persisting cold and gave him a stroke on the back of the head as if to show her maturity.</p>
<p>It was a ceremony of sorts.</p>
<p>What was the ceremony for? If someone asked, Renee would answer this.</p>
<p>It was a ceremony to strengthen her resolve not to wait any longer, but to take action to win him over.</p>
<p>It was a vow to give her all to have him.</p>
<p>What she was doing for him was her own premature coming of age ceremony, and at the same time, her own awakening as the Saint.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 116: Temptation (1)</p>
<p>The next morning in Renee’s room.</p>
<p>Renee dusted the pillow cotton off her face as she laid sprawled across the bed, sighing.</p>
<p>‘…I tore it.’</p>
<p>She ended up tearing the sheets and pillow. Still, it didn’t make her feel more at ease.</p>
<p>She was both embarrassed and proud of the confession she had made yesterday.</p>
<p>Renee breathed slowly to calm herself down before carrying on with her thoughts.</p>
<p>‘…Yeah, I should’ve done this long ago.’</p>
<p>Vera’s reaction was quite telling. If she hadn’t struck him first like that, her relationship with Vera would’ve been stagnant forever.</p>
<p>That was the only way their relationship could take a step further.</p>
<p>Renee raised her hand and ran her fingers over her lips. It was an action she did while reminiscing about the moment when she kissed Vera.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it brought back those sensations.</p>
<p>It was warm and soft, and she could feel the moist air in his breath at that exhilarating moment. She was so thrilled that she wondered whether she had truly become an idiot.</p>
<p>As Renee recalled that moment, the corners of her lips curled upward again, and Annie looked at her actions in bewilderment.</p>
<p>‘Something is…’</p>
<p><b><i>Seems like you did something, but it must be something really, really significant.</i></b></p>
<p>Although it should be something to be proud of, Annie felt her worry overtake those feelings.</p>
<p>That was only natural. How could she not be worried when Renee tore off the sheets and pillow as soon as she woke up and began snickering to herself as she sprawled out on her bed?</p>
<p>How could she not be worried when the Saint she served acted in a way that even a stranger would find concerning?</p>
<p>Annie’s expression turned grave. She even began to entertain the idea that Renee lost her mind after Vera dumped her.</p>
<p>It was when Annie eventually came to the conclusion that Renee was dumped by Vera, and about to offer some words of consolation.</p>
<p>“Annie.”</p>
<p>Renee took the initiative first, speaking in a stern tone, to which Annie responded in an uncharacteristically soldier-like voice.</p>
<p>“Yes sir!”</p>
<p>Renee, who was still in bed, turned in the direction where Annie’s voice was coming from and said.</p>
<p>“I need Annie’s help.”</p>
<p>Annie tilted her head, and her face lit up in bewilderment at the seemingly random remark.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>When Annie asked back, Renee eventually raised her body, sat up in a somewhat uncomfortable position, and exhaled before continuing to speak.</p>
<p>“Please tell me a way to charm Vera.”</p>
<p>Her words were filled with sincerity.</p>
<p>After what happened yesterday, Renee realized that if she wanted to charm the ridiculously stubborn Vera, she needed to be bolder than she was right now.</p>
<p>“By a way, you mean…?”</p>
<p>Renee turned her head to Annie again. She had the most serious expression one could have.</p>
<p>“I want to make it so unbearable for Vera if he doesn’t confess to me.”</p>
<p><i>Shock—!</i></p>
<p>Annie shuddered. Her gaze started to pierce right through Renee. Meanwhile, Renee continued to talk.</p>
<p>“I want to make him only think about me all day. I want to make him suffer from thinking about me. That’s why I want to drive him crazy.”</p>
<p>It was such a dark inner desire, but Renee couldn’t care less.</p>
<p>Realizing that embarrassment couldn’t solve anything, Renee pushed past her weak resolve and continued talking.</p>
<p>“I want to make Vera lose his mind and run to me, so please tell me a way.”</p>
<p>Listening to Renee, Annie swallowed hard with a strained expression.</p>
<p>“…You’re serious.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m serious.”</p>
<p>The air was shrouded in silence. Just like Renee, Annie had the most serious and determined look that one could have, and nodded.</p>
<p>“Alright. It’s time to teach you ‘that’.”</p>
<p>“That?”</p>
<p>“A killer move.”</p>
<p><i>Shock—!</i></p>
<p>Annie opened her eyes wide, and Renee’s face tensed up at the word ‘killer move’.</p>
<p>In the midst of the calm before the storm, Annie spoke.</p>
<p>“Saint, it’s time for sex education.”</p>
<p>It was the moment when the secret technique had finally found a worthy successor.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the training ground behind the mansion.</p>
<p>While Vera aided Aisha in her training, he suddenly zoned out and stopped moving.</p>
<p>What happened yesterday kept bothering him, and he felt heat rising all over him.</p>
<p>His face became slightly clouded.</p>
<p>The words, the actions, the temperature and the sensations of that brief moment kept swirling inside his mind.</p>
<p>He tried to shake it off, but he couldn’t. He tried to ignore it, but even that was impossible.</p>
<p>All he could think of was Renee telling him that she loved him.</p>
<p>The sensations of the moment when their lips met flooded back to his mind.</p>
<p>That frightening yet exhilarating moment when his reason vanished and instinct took hold of him, when he nearly gave in to his desire and let it rule his body like always, was etched on his mind without a way to erase it.</p>
<p>The tremor that began in his fingertips spread throughout his body.</p>
<p>Just thinking about it gave him an impulsive rush. His mind became clouded by an impulse to lead himself and Renee to devastation.</p>
<p><b><i>I want her.</i></b></p>
<p>Vera bit his lips as the thoughts crossed his mind, almost certain that he’d unwittingly gotten drunk on it.</p>
<p>‘You disgusting thing.’</p>
<p>It was a self-deprecating remark.</p>
<p>He was disappointed at himself when a possessive desire arose within him at the mere thought of Renee, and he loathed the nature that resided in him, so Vera gritted his teeth until it made a ‘crunch’ sound.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, across the room, Aisha’s eyes sparkled at Vera’s unmoving form, then she lunged.</p>
<p>“Hiyaaaa!!!”</p>
<p>She thrust her fist forward.</p>
<p><i>Thud!</i></p>
<p>Her knuckle precisely struck the center of Vera’s abdomen. As she recalled the joy at the sensation she felt on her fingertips, Aisha smiled brightly.</p>
<p>When she raised her head a little to check his reaction, Vera was still lost in thought.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Aisha began to punch Vera in the stomach with all her might, as if venting her anger on him.</p>
<p>“Hiya! Yah! Die! Die!”</p>
<p><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i></p>
<p>Vera didn’t give any reaction to Aisha’s punches to his stomach, but instead continued to be lost in thought.</p>
<p><i>– Do you love me?</i></p>
<p>His mind spiraled back to when Renee demanded an answer, and when he was unable to give her one. Renee’s question before she said that also popped up on his mind.</p>
<p><i>– Who are you seeing through me?</i></p>
<p>His thoughts drifted back to her question, and Vera began to ponder deeply.</p>
<p>‘I’m…’</p>
<p>Who was he looking at?</p>
<p>Who was the light he so desperately wanted? What was it?</p>
<p>He never gave it any much thought, or questioned it.</p>
<p>He thought he was looking at Renee since she was the light that awakened him at the end of his previous life.</p>
<p>But he was wrong.</p>
<p>His own reaction to the question, which he couldn’t answer, was the best proof of that.</p>
<p>Even if the Renee by his side was the same Renee from his previous life, it was hard to say that they were the same person since they were two people living different lives at different times.</p>
<p>Even if she grew up to be Renee, she wasn’t the Renee she used to be.</p>
<p>His body understood that they were different people before his stupid head could.</p>
<p>He continued to mull over it, and her question about his feelings entered his mind.</p>
<p><i>– Do you love me?</i></p>
<p>Love.</p>
<p>It was hard to say that the feelings he had for Renee, both in the past and present, was love.</p>
<p>…He couldn’t even figure it out.</p>
<p>The cause of the despair he felt when he saw her death in his past life and the cause of the possessiveness he felt for Renee now were so different and all too complex.</p>
<p>Vera couldn’t define these feelings yet.</p>
<p>“Hyaa! Hyatt! Haiyaa!”</p>
<p><i>Thump! Thump! Thump!</i></p>
<p>Vera scowled upon hearing the loud noise and cast his gaze downward.</p>
<p>The chunky Aisha, who was only as tall as his chest, was hitting his stomach with her ears perked up.</p>
<p>She had the most excited expression he’d ever seen.</p>
<p>Vera grabbed Aisha by the nape and tossed her away for interrupting his train of thought.</p>
<p>“Get lost.”</p>
<p>“Aughhh!!!”</p>
<p>As he briefly watched Aisha flying far away, Vera scowled again.</p>
<p>It was a look of complete confusion and uneasiness because he had to meet Renee in a few hours, but he didn’t know what kind of expression to show her or what to say to her.</p>
<p>His true nature, which he had been suppressing with all of his might, began to shine through at the thought of Renee, and the rationality that he had been using to hide it was faltering, unable to maintain its form.</p>
<p>“Phew…”</p>
<p>He let out a long, exasperated sigh.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hug me.”</p>
<p>Renee said with a smile and her arms wide open. Vera felt his breath stop.</p>
<p>“…Saint.”</p>
<p>“Hug me. It’s an order.”</p>
<p>At that, Vera hesitated once again.</p>
<p>“Come on.”</p>
<p>Renee urged him.</p>
<p>Vera bit his lips at the sight of Renee, who seduced him as soon as they met, as if to prove that her confession yesterday was not a lie.</p>
<p>He couldn’t say no.</p>
<p>Vera was unable to reject Renee’s order because he said that he would grant all of her wishes.</p>
<p>After clenching and unclenching his fists and inhaling deeply, Vera moved closer and hugged Renee gently. Renee then wrapped her outstretched arms around Vera’s waist.</p>
<p>Vera’s heart began to race due to Renee’s scent, and his mind went haywire when he felt their bodies touching.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Renee opened her mouth.</p>
<p>“I had a dream about Vera.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Vera hugged me in my dream, and that’s why I asked you to hug me. It feels good.”</p>
<p>After saying that, Renee buried her head in Vera’s chest.</p>
<p>There was no other reason besides embarrassment.</p>
<p>As much as she tried to act calm, she couldn’t help but feel embarrassed for doing something like this while sober. She wanted to hide it, which led to her actions.</p>
<p>Unlike before, she managed to hide it smoothly even when she was so embarrassed.</p>
<p>As they say, the first time is always the hardest, so Renee used yesterday’s experience as a stepping stone to keep doing skinship without difficulty.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>The words came out seductively.</p>
<p>As Renee clearly felt Vera’s body shaking and his muscles began to tense, she continued speaking.</p>
<p>“You know why am I doing this, right? You know what I’ll do if you try to stop me.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Try to stop me then. I’ll wait for you.”</p>
<p>Having said that, she caressed Vera’s back.</p>
<p>She practiced the killer move Annie had taught her.</p>
<p>‘Calm down… calm down!’</p>
<p>While trying to hide her flushed face and ignore the unnecessary drooling, Renee continued her ‘killer move’.</p>
<p>“Vera.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Vera’s heartbeat is very loud.”</p>
<p>Renee, who felt Vera’s heart pounding at her words, launched her next words without any delay.</p>
<p><i>– When you say this, you must smile seductively! It’s a must! That’s how you do it! You got it, right?</i></p>
<p>Recalling Annie’s request, she recited.</p>
<p>“I guess your body speaks louder than your mouth?”</p>
<p>To be fair, even Renee said it without fully understanding what she was saying.</p>
<p>She simply followed Annie’s instruction in hopes that it’d work out somehow.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Annie’s killer move worked better than expected.</p>
<p>Vera’s body shook violently, and his next words were filled with confusion.</p>
<p>“Sai… n-no way. That’s not true.”</p>
<p>When she saw his response, Renee inwardly yelled in amazement.</p>
<p>‘Annie!’</p>
<p>That was amazing.</p>
<p>Vera had never been this embarrassed or flustered before.</p>
<p>When Renee inwardly yelled in amazement, wondering how far Annie had foreseen it, Vera spoke in a tone that nearly sounded like a plea.</p>
<p>“Please… please don’t do this.”</p>
<p>Vera’s expression, which Renee couldn’t see, collapsed miserably.</p>
<p>Renee’s attempt to tear his rationality apart was too cruel, but he had to beg because he couldn’t refuse her, to which Renee gleefully replied.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>Vera clenched his eyes shut as he sensed his rationality cracking apart for the second time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 117: Temptation (2)</p>
<p>The past week had been a wonderful one for Renee and a terrible one for Vera.</p>
<p>Even as their relationship took an unexpected turn, the moment of their departure from the Empire was fast approaching.</p>
<p>The Imperial Palace was in the midst of cleaning up after the festival. Entering the Crown Prince’s palace, Renee bid farewell to the siblings across from her with a smile on her face.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your help all this time. I hope to see you again next time.”</p>
<p>Maximilian gave a small nod at Renee’s words and answered.</p>
<p>“We should be the ones thanking you. Thank you for saving the empire.”</p>
<p>Maximilian bowed his head. Albrecht, who was standing behind him, followed suit.</p>
<p>“As my brother said, we should be thanking you since we were the ones who received your help. Thank you from the bottom of my heart.”</p>
<p>Albrecht folded his signature golden eyes gracefully, revealed his white teeth and bowed his head, making a rustling sound that earned a chuckle from Renee before proceeding to answer.</p>
<p>“Then we shall be going.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were going to the Academy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know one of the professors there. Vera wants to visit the academy as well.”</p>
<p><i>Brush—</i></p>
<p>Renee muttered as she swept Vera’s hand, causing Vera’s face to stiffen.</p>
<p>The siblings across from them made an ‘ohh’ sound.</p>
<p>Amidst this, Maximilian was the first to regain his composure and cleared his throat before continuing.</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say you were going with Professor Miller?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Fortunately, he agreed to come with us.”</p>
<p>“He’s a competent professor. If you get to know him well, he’ll be a valuable connection to you. Good luck.”</p>
<p>After he said that, Maximilian extended his hand forward.</p>
<p>“Let’s shake hands before you go.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>Renee replied before lifting Vera’s hand and placing it around her own wrist, then said.</p>
<p>“Vera, guide me.”</p>
<p>Vera pushed Renee’s hand gently toward Maximillian with a complicated look on his face.</p>
<p>It was a handshake made by putting two… no, three hands together.</p>
<p>Renee had a beaming expression, whilst Vera, a miserable one. Maximilian’s eyes glistened as if he were watching an intriguing spectacle, and Albrecht, who was a little further away, spotted himself blushing in a hand mirror.</p>
<p>…It was a moment of farewell that was hard to describe.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Late afternoon, in the mansion garden.</p>
<p>Renee, who was sitting comfortably on a sun-drenched bench, smiled and murmured when she felt a presence near her.</p>
<p>“Vera.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Being with Vera makes my heart race so much.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“My heart is pounding.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>There was no response, but she could sense a flinching movement. Renee’s smile widened.</p>
<p>Renee was on cloud nine thanks to it.</p>
<p>She had so much fun when Vera was this embarrassed. Plus, she was happy to be able to express her feelings, and now that she was being so brazen, she no longer felt embarrassed.</p>
<p>That’s why it was so fun.</p>
<p><b><i>So it must be true that humans are animals that grow through experience.</i></b></p>
<p>Renee, who felt satisfied with her own changes, motioned to Vera.</p>
<p>“Come closer.”</p>
<p>Vera approached her.</p>
<p>Renee tapped her hand on the seat next to her and spoke.</p>
<p>“Sit down.”</p>
<p>Vera sat down, making a rustling sound.</p>
<p>After recalling Annie’s killer move, Renee shifted her body to rest on Vera’s thigh.</p>
<p>“Stroke my head.”</p>
<p>This time, Vera didn’t immediately comply and trembled.</p>
<p>‘…Is this still too hard?’</p>
<p>Renee clicked her tongue inwardly, recalling what Annie had taught her.</p>
<p><i>– Slowly, little by little, chip away at his psychological barrier. First, ask him to hold your hand, hug you, carry you on his back, and stroke you. That way, you’ll be able to make progress gradually. So what happens next? Won’t he eventually agree to kiss you when you ask for it? This should be okay, right? This is still appropriate, right? In the end, he’ll be immune to all that.</i></p>
<p>Vera, who grants her a kiss when she asks for one.</p>
<p>Renee, who was striving for that, was getting unnecessarily impatient with Vera’s stone-like demeanor.</p>
<p>“Hurry.”</p>
<p>At this point, she had no choice but to use coercion. She had to break down his psychological barriers by accustoming him to this type of skinship.</p>
<p>At Renee’s stern tone, Vera let out a small sigh and began stroking Renee’s head.</p>
<p><i>Rustle— Rustle—</i></p>
<p>Vera ran his fingers through her white locks, his hand moving like a comb.</p>
<p>Renee’s heart skipped a beat when Vera ran his hand through her hair, and her smile widened.</p>
<p>Watching Renee like that sparked a fire within him.</p>
<p>It was desire.</p>
<p>Vera took a deep breath and began to calm the wave of emotions inside him.</p>
<p>He tried to suppress himself because he thought it was the right thing to do.</p>
<p>What was rising up now was an impulse that would surely hurt Renee, for all the ways he knew to release his lust were violent and selfish.</p>
<p>Vera couldn’t shake off that feeling.</p>
<p>Then, once again, Renee spoke.</p>
<p>“Vera.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Vera smells refreshing.”</p>
<p><i>Flinch—</i></p>
<p>His fingertips trembled as he stroked Renee’s head, and she laughed. Vera said with a crumpled expression.</p>
<p>“…Please don’t do this.”</p>
<p>“What if I say no?”</p>
<p><i>Poke—</i></p>
<p>Renee poked Vera’s thigh with her finger.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you what I would do if you tried to stop me?”</p>
<p>Vera closed his mouth shut.</p>
<p><b><i>I won’t give in so easily.</i></b></p>
<p>That was what Vera meant by his gesture, but it made Renee even more elated.</p>
<p>“You actually like it when I cling to you like this, don’t you? That’s why you provoke me by acting like you hate it.”</p>
<p><b><i>I shouldn’t answer.</i></b></p>
<p>Vera thought to himself, but his mouth continued to speak dutifully.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>If there was one emotion that Vera couldn’t endure, it was impulsiveness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Renee’s temptation was getting more intense day by day.</p>
<p>Holding hands or hugging had already become a routine, but she went further than merely resting on his lap or sitting on his thigh today.</p>
<p><i>Chuu—</i></p>
<p>She went so far as to kiss him on the cheek.</p>
<p>Vera instantly stopped breathing while Renee smiled brightly.</p>
<p>“I love you.”</p>
<p>Renee whispered in Vera’s ear.</p>
<p>Her cheeks flushed red from her own speech.</p>
<p>No matter how much she got used to expressing her feelings, the words ‘I love you’ still made her heart flutter every time she uttered it.</p>
<p>She should have gotten used to it now, yet she couldn’t get used to that one line at all, so Renee buried her head in Vera’s nape since it was strange and embarrassing every time, as if it were her first time saying it.</p>
<p>As Vera felt the soft sensation on his nape, Renee’s words rattled his heart yet again.</p>
<p>It was too much for him to bear. A look of resentment began to appear in his eyes.</p>
<p><b><i>How far does this cruel person want to torment me?</i></b></p>
<p>Such thoughts instilled unnecessary hatred in his heart.</p>
<p>Renee’s reddening neck was visible through her white hair, and reignited his intense desire.</p>
<p><b><i>You can’t do this.</i></b></p>
<p>Just as Vera had that thought and gnashed his teeth…</p>
<p>“Vera, you’re getting hot.”</p>
<p>Renee provoked him.</p>
<p>At that moment, Vera’s rationality was cut off with a snap.</p>
<p>Vera grabbed Renee by the shoulders. He pushed her away and thrust his head toward Renee.</p>
<p>“Uh…!”</p>
<p>Renee’s body trembled at Vera’s sudden action, and Vera, who belatedly regained his reasoning, came to a stop.</p>
<p>His head stopped by Renee’s ear.</p>
<p>As Vera realized what he was about to do, he let out a growl that sounded like a restrained beast with a horribly crumpled expression.</p>
<p>“…Saint.”</p>
<p><i>Thump. Thump.</i></p>
<p>Renee tried to get a hold of her mind, which had been briefly paralyzed by the unexpected situation, before stammering an answer.</p>
<p>“Y-Yes?”</p>
<p>“That’s bad behavior.”</p>
<p>The tone was strict, as if admonishing her. Vera spoke in a voice Renee had never heard before, causing her to nod her head in agreement.</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>
<p>Her voice came out very shaky, and her heart palpitated wildly.</p>
<p>The way that Vera approached her first and that stern tone were very unexpected that it conjured such a reaction from her.</p>
<p>Even during that moment, the corners of Renee’s mouth were rising into a smile, but fortunately, neither of them had realized it yet.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, in front of the carriage heading to the Academy.</p>
<p>Dovan, who was leaving for the Holy Kingdom with Marie, and Aisha, who was heading to the academy with Renee, were saying their goodbyes.</p>
<p>“Aisha, don’t trouble the Saint, don’t get hurt, and make sure to eat your meals. Do you understand?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Please stay healthy as well, Master! I’ll be right there!”</p>
<p>Aisha answered with a wide grin and hugged Dovan tightly.</p>
<p>Dovan smiled at her appearance and stroked Aisha’s head before coming up with a reply.</p>
<p>“Kid, you’re not even learning blacksmithing anymore, so what master are you talking about? From now on, Sir Vera is your master.”</p>
<p>“For me, you are my only master. Vera is not <i>Master</i>.”</p>
<p>Dovan’s smile grew deeper when she said that with her lips pursed.</p>
<p>He was touched that such a young kid thought so highly of him.</p>
<p>Dovan reached into his arms and pulled out a dagger, which he handed to his daughter whom he wouldn’t see for a while.</p>
<p>Aisha’s expression was tinged with surprise when she got the dagger.</p>
<p>“…This is…”</p>
<p>“It’s a present. Do you remember what I told you, Aisha? It’s important to avoid fights if possible. However…”</p>
<p>“…If you have to fight, you must win no matter what.”</p>
<p>Dovan’s lips curved into a smile. Aisha’s eyes sparkled brightly.</p>
<p>“Yeah! I’ll make sure to get stronger and kick Vera’s ass!”</p>
<p>Vera, who was standing in silence, frowned at what he heard and spat out sharply.</p>
<p>“Quit your nonsense and come here already.”</p>
<p>“Please take care of her.”</p>
<p>“Yes, don’t worry.”</p>
<p>“Take care of yourself as well, Saint. I’ll see you when you return to the Holy Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“Yes, please stay healthy as well, Mr. Dovan.”</p>
<p>It was a short farewell.</p>
<p>Then, as if he had no intention of prolonging the conversation, Dovan pushed his wheelchair to Marie’s place.</p>
<p>Just when Aisha looked at Dovan retreating back with a slightly saddened expression…</p>
<p>“Whoops! I’m sorry! Have you been waiting long?”</p>
<p>A carefree voice echoed through the air.</p>
<p>Everyone in the envoy turned their heads toward the source of the sound simultaneously.</p>
<p>The red-haired man was wearing all kinds of odd accessories over his gray suit. It was Professor Miller, his bag hanging from his back.</p>
<p>Renee realized Professor Miller was approaching by his voice and rattling sound and gave him a nod.</p>
<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, it’s really hard to pack all of this stuff.”</p>
<p><i>Hosh—</i></p>
<p>A rough huff escaped Miller’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Those who depart… are there nine people, including myself?”</p>
<p>Renee gave him a nod. There was her, Vera, Aisha, Norn, and the four apprentice priests. Including Miller, there were a total of nine people.</p>
<p>Given that this was an official visit to the Academy, it would be only right to bring personnel to run various errands.</p>
<p>Miller replied with a vigorous nod and said.</p>
<p>“Very well. Please take care of me on the way!”</p>
<p>He held out his hand, requesting a handshake.</p>
<p>As Renee extended her hand with a soft smile, Miller took it and shook it up and down.</p>
<p>As she shook his hand, Renee continued to think.</p>
<p>‘It’s a war now.’</p>
<p>Of course, she was thinking of Vera.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she was so embarrassed that she stopped her plans, but things would be different from now on.</p>
<p>Theresa would be there at the academy. She would ask for her help.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t back down from embarrassment again like she did yesterday.</p>
<p>A flame of anger began to burn within her alongside her resolve.</p>
<p>Then, she had a belated recollection. It was because Vera’s actions at that time seemed too skillful.</p>
<p>‘…He must’ve done everything with that woman.’</p>
<p><b><i>Who and what did you do with them to be able to move your body so skillfully?</i></b></p>
<p>As she thought about it, she remembered the person in the vision that Orgus had shown her.</p>
<p>Someone Vera cherished, someone from the past he had already lost, and someone who had once been Vera’s light.</p>
<p>They could be a guy, a woman, a child, or an elderly man, but her mind had already pictured a lady in her prime at some point, so that person became ‘that woman’ now.</p>
<p>Renee blazed her fighting spirit towards the person who was no longer in this world and said to herself.</p>
<p>‘Just wait and see…!’</p>
<p><b><i>Vera will end up being mine no matter how great you are. I’ll make him forget about you. Unlike you, I will surely make Vera happy and laugh.</i></b></p>
<p>…She said to herself, recalling her determination to tear the bed apart once she found out the truth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 118: Tellon Academy (1)</p>
<p>Three days had passed since they left the Imperial Capital, and there was only one day left until they arrived at the Academy.</p>
<p>Renee and Vera had not exuded any of the weird mood that had been circulating between them.</p>
<p>Renee stopped seducing him and Vera didn’t have to put up with it either.</p>
<p>It was because Miller was sitting across them in the carriage.</p>
<p>“…That being said, wizards are basically a bunch of idiots! I’ve been wanting to say that. Don’t you agree? All they do is talk about Providence, Providence, Providence. They keep repeating it like a broken record, but when asked what providence actually means, none of those morons have any answers. They must have been busy making excuses by saying it was be~yond human comprehension and all. They don’t even know where they are heading. On the other hand, look at sorcery. How comprehensible is that? Offerings, rituals, phenomenons. It’s possible to explain all the principles with these three. Not to mention…”</p>
<p>…It was due to Miller’s endless chatter.</p>
<p>Renee and Vera closed their eyes shut. They felt as if their ears were bleeding.</p>
<p>It was one of those moments of sincere astonishment.</p>
<p>‘I never thought there was a more talkative person than Trevor…’</p>
<p>Vera was distressed. He had to endure hours of suffering and struggling in despair, as if he was dealing with something that shouldn’t exist in the world.</p>
<p>Why not put a stop to it? One may have asked, but Vera had only one answer to it.</p>
<p>He would answer that it was better to suffer through it because he didn’t know when Renee’s seduction would strike him again if he cut off Miller’s chatter and ended the conversation.</p>
<p>Vera didn’t want to go through the ordeal of Renee’s temptation clouding his judgment ever again.</p>
<p>“Gosh, that’s the reality. It’s just frustrating. Doesn’t it make your blood boil to see those wizards aiming for the position of Head Professor? What will happen if we leave the academy to morons like them? We’d all~ be heading to hell together!”</p>
<p><i>Thud!</i></p>
<p>As Miller slapped his thigh with his palm, Renee laughed nervously and went along with him.</p>
<p>“I-Is that so…”</p>
<p>He’d been talking nonstop for the past three days.</p>
<p>Renee’s sanity had been shattered by Miller’s irrational anger toward magic.</p>
<p>A part of her wished he would just stop, but unfortunately, Miller didn’t stop chattering.</p>
<p>“Yes! That is why I want to express my sincere thanks to all of you!”</p>
<p>He put a lot of emphasis in his tone. Then Miller grabbed a book from his suit, flicked the cover, and added.</p>
<p>The identity of the book was the grimoire [Whispers of the Dream Demon].</p>
<p>“This! I’d like to thank you for helping me in acquiring this grimoire! Did you ask what the result of obtaining this was? Those wizard bastards will ne~ver be able to match up with me. Of course, in a prolonged battle, there is always a degree of uncertainty, but for now, I’m confident that I can knock~ their spirits right out of them!”</p>
<p>He said that about five more times.</p>
<p>Renee could also predict what was coming next, too.</p>
<p>It would be a long, long explanation of what the grimoire was.</p>
<p>“It’s a grimoire where secrets from the Age of Gods lie dormant! It’s an item that could destroy an entire nation if it were to fall into the hands of evil! Let’s take a moment to think about it, shall we? Imagine if this thing explodes in the country’s capital. The intellectual beings on that land will fall into a dream and be consumed by hallucination at the same time. The world’s time will still pass even when they’re trapped in a dream that they can’t get out of, right? First, there’ll be a societal collapse, followed by a suspension of governmental functions. Even as those problems keep worsening, people who were caught in dreams slowly dry up and die because of malnutrition, and that’s~ how the country collapses!”</p>
<p>The words were spoken with an eerie air, as if he were describing something enormous and terrifying… No, it was indeed terrifying, but it didn’t evoke any emotion in Vera and Renee since they’d heard this story so many times that their ears were scabbed.</p>
<p>The endless stream of monotonous chatter was getting really tiresome now.</p>
<p>It made Renee lose her temper, and she said these words inadvertently.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be better to burn such an item?”</p>
<p>It was an indirect question, expressing a plea for Miller to stop.</p>
<p>However, Miller was having none of it.</p>
<p>“As it should be! We should do that, but! If we put that aside, the academic value set for this grimoire is ve~ry astronomical! That’s why even at the Academy, it was sealed and only a few scholars are researching it!”</p>
<p>It became a new topic to chatter about.</p>
<p>As if to say ‘I caught you now’, Miller added a new variation to his rambling.</p>
<p>Renee’s face turned grim.</p>
<p>Her agony was made worse by the fact that she felt relieved because it was a story she had never heard before.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Later that night at the campsite.</p>
<p>As they sat around the campfire and began to eat, Miller also ate in silence, which made Renee and Vera’s faces light up with joy like those who had received salvation.</p>
<p>“It’s so delicious.”</p>
<p>Renee said.</p>
<p>The soup was very delicious. Very, very delicious. She wasn’t sure if it was because the soup was really delicious or Miller’s rambling had come to an end, but it was literally delicious.</p>
<p>However, she should not have gotten overwhelmed with emotion and said that it was ‘delicious’.</p>
<p>“Delicious, huh… Speaking of taste, another thesis of mine comes to mind.”</p>
<p>Miller’s eyes shone like a beast on the hunt. Renee’s face turned white while Vera’s face brimmed with anger.</p>
<p>“You’re too noisy.”</p>
<p>Aisha said grumpily. Aisha, who had gone to a different carriage on the first day because she was sick of Miller’s rambling, protested because she couldn’t stand Miller’s behavior anymore.</p>
<p>However, it was a bad move.</p>
<p><i>Clack—</i></p>
<p>Miller stopped moving. His face became as red as his hair, and his eyes widened until they couldn’t get any bigger as he glared at Aisha.</p>
<p>“Do you understand what you’re saying, kiddo? We’re talking about academic stuff. Got it? We’re talking about knowledge. It won’t work. Come here. You don’t seem to understand the importance of knowledge yet because you’re young, so let me ‘explain’ it to you step by step.”</p>
<p>“Hiik…!”</p>
<p>Aisha’s face grew pale. The fur on her body began to stand on end, and her ears curled back. Her tail began to expand and stiffen.</p>
<p>Aisha, scared stiff, threw away the bowl she was holding and ran off into the distance. She was followed by Miller, who had also thrown his bowl away and ran after her, the sound of his accessories clinking accompanying his movements.</p>
<p>“Hey! Stop right there!”</p>
<p>The remaining group threw words of consolation for Aisha’s sacrifice and enjoyed a brief moment of peace with an extremely comfortable expression, as if it couldn’t get any more comfortable than this.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day, on the road to the academy.</p>
<p>Renee felt tears welling up in her eyes; it was time to say goodbye to Miller. His endless rambling would finally come to an end.</p>
<p>That fact alone brought her overwhelming happiness.</p>
<p>Renee said to Miller, her face showing her growing happiness.</p>
<p>“We’re almost there. Oh no, this makes me sad.”</p>
<p>She was not the least bit sad about it, but she thought she might as well say something pleasant and get it over with since they were parting ways, but Miller replied.</p>
<p>“Gosh, we can still meet by chance while you’re at the Academy, right? Although our conversation won’t be as enjoyable as it is now.”</p>
<p>Renee didn’t want to meet him even if it was by chance, and besides, only Miller found the conversation enjoyable.</p>
<p>The words were already on the tip of her tongue, but Renee held them in with superhuman patience.</p>
<p>At that time, Miller asked.</p>
<p>“So, is the Saint going to see Professor Theresa?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. I am… and Vera has some business at the Academy, so I guess he’ll go there as well.”</p>
<p>“Huh? You mean the Academy?”</p>
<p>Miller tilted his head.</p>
<p>Vera gave him a brief glance before shifting his gaze back to the window and continued to speak.</p>
<p>“I’m going to ask the archaeologists at the Academy for some advice.”</p>
<p>It was a brief sentence that went straight to the point. It prompted Miller to ask a question.</p>
<p>“Archaeology? What are you going there for? You could have asked me.”</p>
<p>As if stating the obvious and as if asking why he was wasting his time, Miller added.</p>
<p>“I’m the Head of the Archaeology Department, though?”</p>
<p>In an instant, the silence descended upon them as if the air was frozen.</p>
<p>Vera’s eyes widened, and Renee winced.</p>
<p>Startled, Renee asked.</p>
<p>“Professor, aren’t you in charge of sorcery…”</p>
<p>“I am an adjunct professor. Archaeology is a department that is part of the faculty of Sorcery. Isn’t sorcery itself an ancient technique in the first place? Of course, I’m also in charge of that.”</p>
<p>Vera, who was listening to his carefree remarks, wasn’t able to ignore it and replied with an appalled expression.</p>
<p>“…I’d like it if you stop joking around.”</p>
<p>He wished Miller would just say it was a joke, but Miller shrugged and spoke.</p>
<p>“Why would I joke about this? It’s fine, just ask away. There must be only a few people at the academy who know as much as I do.”</p>
<p>A deep smile appeared on his face.</p>
<p>“I’ll ‘explain’ it well so that you understand.”</p>
<p>What followed was a cruel declaration.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Asking Miller for advice was too cruel for Vera, who had suffered from him in the past few days.</p>
<p>If he briefly told Miller about the dagger he obtained at the auction house and asked Miller to explain, he’d probably ramble about it all day.</p>
<p>Despite his loud inner protests, there was nothing he could do.</p>
<p>There was no need for Miller to lie about his responsibilities, and if he was indeed the Department Head, then that meant that no one else could know more about the dagger than Miller.</p>
<p>Vera drew the blade from his waist with a sad and bitter expression and handed it to Miller, who examined it for a moment before speaking.</p>
<p>“Is this dagger for ritualistic use?”</p>
<p>Vera’s question was answered right away.</p>
<p>“Let’s see, did you say it was from the ruins at the western end’s canyon?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then it’s a relic from the Age of Gods at the very least. And since it was Gorgan’s territory during the Age of Gods… it must be a dagger used in a ritual to honor Gorgan.”</p>
<p>Vera’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Aside from Vera’s admiration for Miller’s ability to know the origin of the dagger at a glance, a number of things came to mind as a result of what he said.</p>
<p>Gorgan, Wave of Despair.</p>
<p>The tyrant of the sea, said to be the most savage of the nine ancient species.</p>
<p>When its name was mentioned, Vera’s speculation turned into conviction.</p>
<p>‘…As expected, this item is related to the ancient species.’</p>
<p>It was also a relic of an ancient species that was closely related to Aidrin. Aidrin’s energy didn’t react for no reason, after all.</p>
<p>As he was deep in thought, Miller continued to speak.</p>
<p>“Hmm, judging by its sculpted grooves and craftsmanship style, it wasn’t a simple ritual. In their culture, the amount of grooves is determined by the significance of the rite. Can you see the bumps here? One, two… nine. If there were nine, it would have been an event almost on a national level.”</p>
<p>The rest of his explanation, which he gave as he gently scratched at the rusty and chipped parts, was irrelevant to Vera, but there were some useful bits for sure.</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s really a good item. If we dig deep enough, we might be able to find one or two mysteries hidden in it.”</p>
<p>Mysteries.</p>
<p>Vera’s eyes glistened at the idea that he could uncover some kind of mystery.</p>
<p>Friede’s ability to manipulate the wind. It meant he could gain power on a par with that.</p>
<p>‘I hit the jackpot.’</p>
<p>A small smile appeared around Vera’s mouth.</p>
<p>He had realized the weakness of Sanctuary in the battles that he had fought recently.</p>
<p>The Sanctuary’s drawback was that it couldn’t be utilized in a space with multiple allies. The solution was right in front of him.</p>
<p>“How do we extract it?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know at the moment. I think I’ll have to go through this more in the lab, but you should come by my lab later. I’ll take a good look at it.”</p>
<p><i>Thud—</i></p>
<p>Miller muttered, tapping on the dagger’s blade and Vera nodded, forgetting that he might suffer from Miller’s rambling.</p>
<p>Inside the carriage, only Renee realized it, putting a worried expression on her face.</p>
<p><strong> T/N: A sorcerer doesn’t use mana, but a wizard uses mana. It’s a difficult concept to explain because in English and the west in general, we refer everything ‘Magical’ as Magic, but in Korean they are much more specific.</strong></p>
<p><strong> In this series, sorcery will be used more akin to magic that’s grounded in reality, such as curses and other forms of magic that doesn’t involve creation. Wizards will be more fantasy-like, where they will create fireballs, ice, and such. We will try to differentiate them, but just keep this in mind.</strong></p>
