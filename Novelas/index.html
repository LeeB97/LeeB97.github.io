<p>Chapter 345</p>
<p>The Chinese leader’s closest aides, including his personal connections and immediate subordinates who were either from his hometown or had worked with him closely, were called the Xi Clan. They were the people who had been helping the leader remove his political opponents as he slowly climbed into power.</p>
<p>Liu Wang was one of them. He was the drafter of the New Normal and served as the head coach of the Chinese economy behind the scenes. It was safe to say that his power was comparable to the power that the Guides had held during the Stage of Advent. In addition to his ability to impact the Chinese economy through his signature alone, he wielded enough power to single-handedly cause harm to individuals by simply pointing at them.</p>
<p>However, the man’s authority was solely derived from his social position, and he didn’t possess any supernatural abilities. In fact, the true possessor of such a power was the girl standing beside him. She was capable of physically breaking someone’s skull and extracting their spine without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the girl was clearly rattled by being so close to him. Before we got into the waiting car, she asked me in a cautious manner if she could take a seat next to me and Liu Wang in the passenger seat. Then, she added that Liu Wang would serve as a guide to the gold bar storage.</p>
<p>What was interesting about it was that she actually referred to him as a ‘guide.’ Despite her fear of him, she still used that terminology as it was influenced by the combination of her experiences in the Stage of Advent and her present life on Earth. This was a transition period for her.</p>
<p>Anyway, I nodded because I had an issue to deliver to Chinese economic officials. The girl formally introduced herself when she sat next to me. Her voice no longer trembled as if she had mentally prepared herself.</p>
<p>“My name is Yang Ga-Hye. It’s an honor to have you here.”</p>
<p>Then, Liu Wang got on the passenger seat and lowered his head briefly. To non-speakers, Chinese often sounded noisy as it was a language with numerous tones, but Liu Wang lowered his voice and began to speak calmly. He spoke for a long time, but in essence, he conveyed his gratitude for being able to accompany me and expressed his wholehearted commitment to serving me.</p>
<p>As we drove into downtown Beijing, I noticed that we were the only car on the road. Not a single civilian was in sight, and there were only police officers stationed in the area. The road was so empty and cleared up.</p>
<p>By the time the vehicle sped up after getting the officer’s salute, Liu Wang opened his mouth after carefully looking at me for a while.</p>
<p>Yang Ga-Hye interpreted, “He said he is a believer in the new type of major power relationship.”</p>
<p>The new type of major power relationship was the idea to respect each other without having conflict with the U.S. The leader’s purpose for sending a business figure from the Xi Clan was to gain my favor and alleviate the IMF’s demanding requests. The leader was obviously treating me as the owner of the club instead of the Awakened Odin.</p>
<p>Liu Wang began to describe how hard he had tried to prevent the incident. I knew it was all a lie, but I let him keep talking. The information he revealed was exclusive to the innermost circle of the leader, but it wasn’t what I had been expecting to hear.</p>
<p>When he started talking about the IMF, I finally interrupted, “The Small Golden Fish was comprised of two elements: new renminbi bills and gold. Do the Chinese authorities plan to continue issuing new renminbi bills?”</p>
<p>When Yang Ga-Hye translated what I said to Liu Wang, he suddenly became quiet.</p>
<p>The renminbi’s monetary plan had ended in failure. Reissuing the new renminbi currency, which was tied to gold, would only cause a national crisis. As a result, the Chinese government was withdrawing and returning to the existing old renminbi notes.</p>
<p>“I can just take over the gold, but how will you deal with my loss in regards to the new renminbi?” I asked ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Originally, the Small Golden Fish was a product made under the assumption of bankruptcy, just like China’s currency reform. It was aimed to puff up the bubble and then slam it. The problem arose there because I had bought them all.</p>
<p>I continued mercilessly, “I calculated, and the damage alone would be worth two trillion dollars.”</p>
<p>At last, Yang Ga-Hye realized why I came to China. For a moment, she couldn’t interpret my demands, but she soon stammered and started talking.</p>
<p>“Since you breached the contract and failed to fulfill it, we must now commence discussions regarding the reimbursement of six trillion dollars in accordance with international practice, which is three times my incurred losses. However, considering the circumstances of the authorities, I can accept five trillion U.S. dollars instead,” I said casually while looking out the window.</p>
<p>Liu Wang was articulate and cognizant that what he said next would determine a lot. Therefore, the car became as quiet as the street outside.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Liu Wang barely managed to suppress the urge to scream due to the stifling atmosphere in the car. The phrase ‘international practice’ had always been a powerful tool, and it had been employed several times during trade disputes with the U.S. prior to the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>As the defeated nation, China had no choice but to comply with it. However, five trillion dollars was an astronomical amount. That exceeded the two hundred and ten billion dollars they had gotten from the IMF when the government’s foreign exchange reserves became empty.</p>
<p>Basically, five trillion dollars was twenty times more than the amount they currently had! Although this wasn’t an act of physical violence, it was still a form of cruel violence that was certain to inflict severe damage. Even if Odin’s thunderbolt, which was frequently discussed by the Awakened, wouldn’t be able to impact the country more than this.</p>
<p>Liu Wang didn’t scream, but he turned his head to eye Odin. Then, he became speechless. The guy who had casually talked about five trillion dollars as if it wasn’t a big deal was now looking out the window with indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only one Liu Wang could make eye contact with was Yang Ga-Hye, an Awakened he brought as an interpreter because she had been on the same stage as Odin in Act Two, Stage One. However, she didn’t meet his expectations at all.</p>
<p>The vast difference in their statuses, both in the Stage of Advent and on Earth, was so immense that she found it difficult to even make eye contact with Odin. The gulf between them was akin to that between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Of course, Liu Wang had somewhat expected this, but he also believed that Yang Ga-Hye’s beauty would lighten up the mood.</p>
<p>Liu Wang shifted his gaze back to the driver’s seat and scrunched up his face, indicating that the weight on his shoulders was taking a toll on his entire body. His opponent was the owner of the club and a man with supernatural powers. The man obviously possessed a wealth of knowledge in economics and was adept at controlling figures, like Jonathan and Gillian, who were legendary in the financial industry.</p>
<p>In fact, that was why Liu Wang couldn’t understand why Odin demanded that they give him five trillion dollars in capital right now. He should have known that this was impossible for them.</p>
<p>Liu Wang asked, “Can we replace it with U.S. bonds?”</p>
<p>Odin replied in a calm tone.</p>
<p>Then, Yang Ga-Hye interpreted, “You will still have to give him 3.5 trillion dollars.”</p>
<p>Liu Wang was on the verge of informing Odin that the payment would be made over a span of more than a decade, but he stopped himself. China’s economy would be on the decline for a while. They would be overwhelmed by the U.S. in the trade dispute, and it was impossible to record a large surplus like they had in the past even if a miracle happened.</p>
<p>In the event that there was even a minor surplus and all of their annual foreign currency earnings were spent, the Chinese economy would become vulnerable to attacks from capital forces.</p>
<p>To Liu Wang, Odin looked like an atrocious monster. He walked like a human and was dressed in an expensive suit, but his jaws were wider than any of the extraterrestrial monsters that had invaded on the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>What was the reason for Odin sending occupation forces, the IMF, to forcefully enter the market? In light of the newly opened up market, who would control them? It was Odin. The nation would be ruined, and all the Chinese companies and state-owned businesses with high potential would be busy getting into Odin’s pockets.</p>
<p>However, Odin would never be happy with that. He was asking for five trillion dollars in capital, including a penalty for the loss.</p>
<p>Right then, Liu Wang heard a familiar word that didn’t have to go through the interpreter. Panama Papers! Mossack Fonseca!</p>
<p>In fact, Liu Wang and his family had secretly amassed a slush fund in the capital. He felt that the invisible hand of darkness had grabbed and was pulling his hair strongly to the ground. It was the story he wanted to hide, but Odin clearly knew the existence of the slush funds.</p>
<p>At that time, Liu Wang gasped.</p>
<p>Yang Ga-Hye said, “He is asking if it would be possible if the Chinese authorities collected all the offshore funds.”</p>
<p>To what extent will he deplete our funds? Will he go as far as to extract our very bone marrow?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the problem at hand was that the offshore slush funds didn’t solely belong to the current government. It could have been feasible to accumulate 3.5 trillion dollars if China had seized the slush funds of past leaders and their associates. This was a matter that all of China’s powerful figures throughout history were intertwined in!</p>
<p>Liu Wang had to answer, so he barely opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“... As you know, touching the slush funds of the old regime in addition to the current government creates a lot of issues. Please consider the situation of the authorities.”</p>
<p>“He asked if you mean you want to rebel now.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>Liu Wang became afraid to speak more. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he anticipated what avaricious words the monster in the back seat would spew next.</p>
<p>“I saved you from drowning, but it’s like you are asking me to even take care of your stuff. If you are afraid of rebellion, then you should spare no money to hire Awakened. After all, there is one right here,” Yang Ga-Hye translated.</p>
<p>Then, she told Liu Wang her personal opinion for the first and last time, “You will have to thank Odin while he is being merciful. At least he is sparing your lives.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The car stopped in front of the People’s Bank of China in Beijing. Since China had revealed its gold holdings, the gold bar storage located under the bank had briefly gained a reputation as the world’s largest gold warehouse. Under normal circumstances, they would have seized not only electronic devices but also any sheets of paper from individuals who entered there.</p>
<p>Places requiring high security had a similar structure. There was only one entrance at the Federal Reserve Bank’s gold bar vault in New York, the Cat Food Warehouse, the World Awakened Association’s headquarters’ altar room, the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues’ base, and my hideout in the past. In addition, there were people stationed there for twenty-four hours with security devices attached to them.</p>
<p>As a precaution against attacks from other Awakened, the Chinese government may have recruited the cooperative ones to safeguard this place. However, they had opted to station regular shooters instead, as they were wary of the consequences of their previous actions of detaining the Awakened.</p>
<p>Chinese soldiers armed with automatic firearms saluted Liu Wang whenever they saw him. Liu Wang had been silent for a while. As he stepped into the Golden Hall of Fame, a place where mere monetary value became meaningless, he was consumed by the notion that the country would need to generate five trillion dollars in the future. Therefore, only the sound of footsteps filled the air.</p>
<p>Liu Wang inserted a key into the final door of the storage room and entered the password. The lights in the ceiling illuminated a long corridor that resembled a gold prison or a brick factory warehouse. Hundreds of spacious rooms were stacked with gold bars, and the spectacle was so enchanting that it could cause people to lose their sense of reality. Gold had become nothing in this warehouse.</p>
<p>There were fifteen thousand tons of gold bars, which was equivalent to 7500 trucks that could carry two tons each. The light from the ceiling reflected off the gold bars, causing them to gleam brilliantly.</p>
<p>However, it was that night that I received an urgent call from Jamie.</p>
<p>&lt;Jamie: There is something weird going on in the association.&gt;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 346</p>
<p>A certain thought came to my mind first.</p>
<p>&lt;What about Seong-Il’s son? Ki-Cheol.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;He went back to Seoul five days ago because he said he wanted to stay with his mother.&gt;</p>
<p>I returned to Korea after entrusting Kim Cheong-Soo with all the work related to the transportation of gold and the IMF.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report of an abnormal phenomenon, I initially assumed that the ritual had begun. However, the picture taken of the abnormalities was quite unusual. The entrance of the association headquarters was now blocked with a blue barrier, which was similar to how dungeons worked.</p>
<p>When Jamie and I arrived at the location by helicopter, we noticed that the press had gathered outside the area controlled by the military and police. Both Korean and foreign journalists were present, indicating their interest in the association.</p>
<p>Since the association had requested for an embargo[1], there was no breaking news broadcasted on television immediately. However, news of the phenomenon had spread out through social media.</p>
<p>At a glance, it looked like the headquarters had become a dungeon. It was like how the whole area was blocked by the power of the Old One when the Awakened entered the dungeon of the Seven Demon Kings in the Stage of Advent, except this time, the situation was reversed.</p>
<p>Apparently an external attack was in progress, and it was likely being carried out by a species originating from a dimension known as Star Dragorin. That was the most likely scenario. I had assumed this would happen when I made a deal with Doom Kaos, but I still thought it was acceptable.</p>
<p>Considering the mechanism, by which the Old One created dungeons on the mainland of the Seven Demon Kings, I identified shared conditions. It applied to the dungeons of the Baclans as well. Baclan dungeons were strategically placed in military bases, arenas, and the king’s palace, rather than in residential areas. This led me to believe that I could easily clear them. However, I was to be dropped directly onto their mainland, as in the Challenger quest.</p>
<p>Therefore, my task was simply to establish a defensive system in the designated military areas of the human legion, specifically the current association headquarters where the majority of the Korean Awakened would congregate.</p>
<p>Moreover, the species that the Old One chose as soldiers had to confront the Seven Demon Kings’ corps sooner or later. Their firepower was bound to be dispersed, and they couldn’t exert their power properly in the land where Doom Man resided, unlike when they were in the mainland of the other Dooms.</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than exposing our mainland to the entire Seven Demon Kings Corps, humanity’s safety would be more guaranteed when we were working under Doom Kaos. That was why I accepted Doom Kaos’s deal, so this wasn’t something to be bewildered about.</p>
<p>In addition, Orca and Yeon-Hee’s pet were in the association’s headquarters. The creatures were of such strength and power that they were deemed ‘monarchs.’ Uncertain of the level of difficulty that the monsters attempting to impede the ritual would pose, even if they managed to get past Orca and Yeon-Hee’s pet and reach the altar, their efforts would only serve to delay the ritual’s completion, as they would be swiftly annihilated.</p>
<p>Since the priests of the human corps were all gathered there, the association’s headquarters was technically an SSS-class dungeon.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Zeus’s Thunder Spear has been removed.]</p>
<p>I told Jamie, “Expand the restricted area as wide as possible.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The association’s boundaries remained fixed using the same reasoning that created Odin’s Absolute Warzone. Nonetheless, during my conflict with Doom Dejire, a minor blemish had appeared on the Absolute Warzone, suggesting that a forceful impact being exerted over several days could potentially create a small crack.</p>
<p>Zing-!</p>
<p>Stalks of lightning remained for a long time after the thunderstorms passed. Therefore, those who were shocked were the few people who were able to witness the scene inside the boundaries instead of only looking from the outside.</p>
<p>Jamie was one of those lucky people. Although she had seen the Valkyrie during the club conference, it was her first time directly witnessing a destructive force. Since she was a club member, there were many ways for her to access the superhuman abilities of the Awakened.</p>
<p>There were multiple cases where the Awakened causing problems had been captured on video. However, countries made every effort to conceal these incidents by categorizing them as confidential. Things hadn’t gotten out of control as each country spent around two hundred thousand dollars per person to shut their mouths</p>
<p>Anyway, Jamie was definitely more fascinated by the thunderstorms than by any of the videos she had ever watched before. As I drew closer to her, the expression on her face, which was steeped in fantasy, became more distinct. In her eyes, there was a scene of charred earth and jagged bolts of lightning raining down from the sky.</p>
<p>Jamie couldn’t take her eyes off the vast expanse ahead of her.</p>
<p>“It will be dangerous if I get closer, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>There was no need to warn her.</p>
<p>I simply responded, “You will become a pile of ashes as soon as you touch something.”</p>
<p>Jamie looked like she was in her dream.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A campsite was built right in front of the boundary blocking the association’s headquarters. If this were the Stage of Advent, the tents would have been made of monster leather and woodblocks, but Jamie’s campsite here was great. We had a spacious camping vehicle and the ability to regulate the level of illumination using mobile LED lights, whether it was daytime or nighttime. LED lights were used as a threat to prevent reporters from approaching.</p>
<p>A day had passed since I had started handling the construction in China in the camping car. After the embargo was lifted, the media began to report on abnormalities at the association’s headquarters. There was an abundance of articles and news pieces about this that surpassed the coverage of China’s IMF bailout, with reported content that included photos taken of lightning bolts from a distance.</p>
<p>However, all they could do was make ridiculous assumptions. Around sunset, the boundary disappeared, and the Korean Awakened had gathered after watching the news.</p>
<p>As I walked through the gate alongside them, the scent of blood wafted toward me. It had been a while since I had last smelled that scent. On one side, Yeon-Hee’s pet was gnawing on something, and I could see marks indicating that a body had been dragged toward the building where Orca resided.</p>
<p>I could hear the voices of the survivors, as well as the association’s security personnel, coming from the same direction. I dispatched a group of Awakened to that side while I made my way toward Yeon-hee’s pet.</p>
<p>Crunch. Crunch.</p>
<p>A huge mouth was chewing off several corpses at the same time, and the parts of the body that were cut and dropped on the ground looked just like human limbs. I could tell that they were not the security mercenaries because they were not wearing their uniforms.</p>
<p>At that time, Yeon-Hee’s pet cast a menacing gaze in my direction, its eyes brimming with bloody murderous intent. The excitement of the battle had not yet been drained from the Kciphos as there were multiple wounds on it. It appeared as though destroying the bodies of its enemies, those who had caused it harm, was not enough to satiate its agitation.</p>
<p>Kraaaaaak-!</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s pet started to scream. Since it hadn’t consumed the entirety of the body, fragments of limbs protruded from its mouth, revealing that it was definitely not a human body. Even though the Kciphos’ body fluids and blood were mixed within, pointed ears were visible.</p>
<p>Judging by the length of the dead creature’s skull and limbs, it was not significantly different from us humans. However, its skin wasn’t blue like the Moong. The Old One must have chosen a species that resembled humans.</p>
<p>I wanted to see the more intact bodies and find the entrance to the dungeon where they came in, but I couldn’t feel the twisted flow of time and space. I wondered if the entrance to the dungeon had closed with their annihilation. It was a possibility.</p>
<p>This had been the situation during the Stage of Advent when Doom Kaos had focused his malevolence on me, which held significant implications. However, for the time being, there seemed to be no issues with the building where the ritual was taking place because I heard the sound of Yeon-Hee’s regular breathing as I raised my Sense.</p>
<p>The regions that were formerly used as the entrance and garden for the resort were now concentrated with signs of battle and wriggling tentacles belonging to Orca.</p>
<p>During this time, Kim Ji-Hoon, who had been persistently pursuing Ji-Ae noona during the Stage of Advent, emerged with two lifeless bodies slung over his shoulders. He lowered his head silently and put the bodies on the floor.</p>
<p>First, I looked at a body where Orca’s tentacle had penetrated its abdomen. That one didn’t have pointed ears. By anyone’s eyes, he was the same species as humans as he had the same DNA as ours.</p>
<p>It was an elderly man with a lengthy white beard that extended down to his chest, and his eyes were frozen wide in fear as his body had gone into rigor mortis[2]. He still had a short cane clutched tightly in his hand. His robe was originally white, but it was now soaked in blood.</p>
<p>The second one was a body whose lower body was cut off. The tattoos engraved all over the body stood out, but this body could be regarded as a female human.</p>
<p>The two bodies shared a common trait in that the same sentence was inscribed on the elderly man’s robe and tattooed onto the woman’s chest. The sentence ran vertically through all seven archetypes, and it was undoubtedly an indication of their respective groups.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before I found what it was. The weapons of the intruders, which were brought in by the Awakened under Kim ji-Hoon’s guidance, shared a common name.</p>
<p>[Lacryma Priest Organization’s Big Shield]</p>
<p>[Lacryma Priest Organization's Combat Cane]</p>
<p>[Lacryma Priest Organization’s Sacred Sword]</p>
<p>Lacryma Priest Organization… One of the residents in the Savior’s city expressed his opinion of the group.</p>
<p>“The invaders weren’t monsters. There must have been another Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>That might have been the case for those who didn’t know the truth.</p>
<p>After kicking a severed head in their direction, the Awakened noticed the pointed ears on the head.</p>
<p>I stated calmly, “They are not humans. They are enemies we have to confront in the future.”</p>
<p>Then, I turned to the tentacle castle where Orca stayed. The Lacryma Priest Organization probably had the goal of destroying the altar of Doom Man.</p>
<p>However, they might have misunderstood that the altar was at Orca’s place since the traces of the battle were concentrated there. It was natural because the ominous aura emanating from Orca’s castle had captured their attention.</p>
<p>I walked to where Orca was. Although the size of the invading force was relatively small, consisting of only two attack squads, it appeared that they possessed enough core skills to break through Orca’s realm and hurt it.</p>
<p>Orca greeted me with five bodies spread out as if it was appreciating its masterpiece.</p>
<p>“Lacryma.”</p>
<p>The term mentioned earlier also came out of the darkness in Orca’s hood. I nodded and then replied, “That name might refer to the Old One. What do you think?”</p>
<p>1. An agreement between a source and journalists not to publish or report on a story until a specified date and time. ☜</p>
<p>2. The stiffening of the body’s muscles after death due to the depletion of ATP, which causes the inability of the muscles to relax. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 347</p>
<p>Orca nodded slowly, then stared at the bodies. I sensed that it was lost in its own sense of power and pride as it looked at them. Apparently the five men who had made it this far were formidable enough to elicit such a response from Orca.</p>
<p>Orca was observing their dead bodies as if it was admiring a work of art while emanating an aura that suggested it didn’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p>When I shifted my gaze to the bodies, Orca opened its mouth, “Orca’s spoils.”</p>
<p>Their weapons had all been destroyed as it was a quite fierce battle. No information window popped up, and there were more bodies of intruders outside. Orca’s insolent attitude was annoying, but it was acceptable. It had defended the headquarters, so it was up to it if it wanted to take all the spoils. I nodded at it to express my approval.</p>
<p>Then, unique Maruka tentacles grew out of the mud. Dozens of small and thick tentacles intertwined with each other to form the shape of a throne. Other tentacles that were not part of the throne were used to tie up the dismembered body parts. The remains of a body that had been severed from the head down to the groin, as well as the body of a female whose limbs had been completely cut off, were pieced together and suspended in the air like exhibits.</p>
<p>I left after watching Orca appreciating its trophies.</p>
<p>The structures that once served as warehouses and stores in the former Jeonil Resort were in ruins. Although they had already been marked for demolition, the destruction of power lines and buried pipes resulted in water pooling on one side. There was evidence of fire on the other. It was the military’s responsibility to deal with them.</p>
<p>Jamie had entered with the soldiers, and she walked towards me. Upon seeing the forty-five torn and trampled bodies that had died in various ways, she eventually began to vomit. Only the Awakened could look around the place where blood and organs were cluttered in an unperturbed manner.</p>
<p>I spotted Kim Ji-Hoon sorting out the unique characteristics of the dead. Indeed, the composition of the invaders varied. Some were species that were no different from humans, but I also noticed a species that resembled dwarves from their solid skeletons.</p>
<p>The invaders could be classified into three species. There was the one that looked the same as mankind, the dwarf species, and the pointy-eared species. Therefore, everyone had the same suspicion that the extraterrestrial beings that were often described in fantasy novels actually existed somewhere in outer space. Yes, like the elves and the dwarves.</p>
<p>Regardless of what they called themselves, their appearance resembled the fantastical creatures that humans had imagined, making the names made by humans seem fitting for them.</p>
<p>“Hehe…”</p>
<p>One of the Awakened laughed in a weird manner, then he immediately shut his mouth in surprise. However, he wasn’t the only one who welcomed the emergence of new enemies. None of them had spoken these thoughts out loud, but they were all thinking the same thing. They wanted to check the intruders’ mainland and regain the power they enjoyed in the Stage of Advent. They wanted to unleash the strength that had been suppressed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After returning home, Kim Ji-Hoon only felt content for the first two weeks. Following the honeymoon period, more frustration overwhelmed him as time passed by. The news was busy broadcasting China’s and the world’s economic war and they often used the faces of the earth’s authorities as references.</p>
<p>However, it was ridiculous. Almost everything was absurd here. Although he was certain that he could decapitate either the Chinese leader or the U.S. president at any given moment, he refrained from doing so, as he had no reason to and it went against the guidelines set forth by the association governed by Odin. He could also steal the fifteen thousand tons of gold stored in China if he wanted to.</p>
<p>What if I grab the Chinese leader’s neck and threaten them?</p>
<p>If the other Awakened didn’t intervene, then he had the power to do everything imaginable. He had even reached the master section.</p>
<p>In fact, he believed that he would be able to exert his power upon his return to the mainland of humans[1]. The ideas he had discussed with his squad members were plans that they intended to implement as soon as he arrived. Their goal was to gather all the Awakened from around the world and establish a world of Awakened under the leadership of the Savior Odin by reassembling their squad.</p>
<p>However, Odin clearly had a different intent. He always claimed symbiosis with the poor mainlanders. He even said that he would implant microchips inside the Awakened. Control was imposed, so the current situation was the same as the time before the Stage of Advent. The Jeonil Group still governed Korea, and the world was only run by money.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>All the time that he had spent rolling around like a dog and fighting like a demon on the stage were in vain. Furthermore, now normal humans looked warily at the Awakened who had saved the world for them.</p>
<p>We are the ones who are keeping the world safe! Not the two hundred thousand dollars or pieces of a gold bar!</p>
<p>The Awakened deserved more, especially those who stood on the side of Ms. Mary in the Final Stage.</p>
<p>About a month had passed after returning to the mainland, and it was an unexpectedly long time. He was unable to exercise his full potential due to his increasing dissatisfaction and frustration, which hindered his ability to make sound judgments.</p>
<p>However! It seemed to be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Ting-</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon flicked his finger, causing a blood-soaked gold coin to spin mercilessly. This was the only item that he was authorized to take from the dead invaders. He snatched at the coin again and began to giggle in a silly manner.</p>
<p>A portrait of an old man donning a crown was embedded in the coin, but the minting hadn’t been done delicately. It resembled a coin from the Middle Ages, indicative of the intruders’ lack of civilization.</p>
<p>Another thing that was important was their appearances. He had seen Odin’s skeletal dragon before, so it was possible for strange monsters to exist in the world like elves and dwarves. If these bodies were still intact instead of being chewed by the Kciphos, then they could be beautiful elves.</p>
<p>According to Odin, their mainland was the extraterrestrial space where the Awakened would invade and advance in the future. He had expected the next destination to be the monsters’ mainland, but the land of the elves sounded much better!</p>
<p>They would depart sooner or later, and there would be no need to make peace there. This was something Odin and the association had consistently declared.</p>
<p>I will be able to exert all my power there!</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon crumpled the coin after staring at it for a while. The king carved on the coin was also crushed. Right around that time, he received instructions for all Awakened to withdraw and return. He hastily stuffed the crumpled coin into his pocket before venturing out to find Ji-Ae noona.</p>
<p>He couldn’t approach Mary or the other leaders of the association, but apart from comradeship, there were always other people he needed to make sure that he was on good terms with. Ji-Ae was one of them.</p>
<p>“Are you going to Seoul, noona? Then, I will drop you off there.”</p>
<p>“By car?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We can’t get around on our usual rides, so I got a car instead. Or would you like to drive? When you press the accelerator, it’s not too bad.”</p>
<p>He had spent his entire share of the two hundred thousand U.S. dollars he had received to get the car.</p>
<p>“There is a lot to tell you on the way.”</p>
<p>“Just send me a message later,” Kim Ji-Ae answered bluntly and turned her back to him.</p>
<p>He lowered his head. “Okay, noona. Take care.”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon then raised his head and moved to his car. Since he had been inside the building where the Maruka clan member resided and had recovered many bodies, his car had quickly become dirty with mud and blood. He could use the shower at the rest area.</p>
<p>Anyway, he couldn’t wait to get off the highway. One of the ways to relieve his stress over the past week was to overtake low-class civilians’ cars on the road. He felt better when he had a quarrel with the owners of bougie cars. He could coquet them, stop the car on the shoulder of the highway, and give them the bitter taste of violence.</p>
<p>After beating them to the point where they were barely alive and were begging for mercy, he often snidely said: “Thank Odin, you poor things.”</p>
<p>He felt a sense of relief after making such a statement.</p>
<p>Woong-!</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon started the engine. However, the phone on the dashboard vibrated and caught his attention. He had received messages while he was cleaning up the headquarters: one spam and another from his father. The others were notifications from the group chat.</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent was fucking long, but it appeared that everything had come to a halt since his departure. The group chats he had prior to entering the stage remained the same in his phone application. Although he had never responded to the chat of low-ranking civilians, something caught his attention all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il.</p>
<p>The name sparked a vague sense of appreciation within him. He was a civilian colleague who had gone to the same school as him in the past. It was when Odin was his classmate and Mary was his homeroom teacher. The savior with divine prestige and power was once in the same space with him. None of his civilian classmates would know the truth.</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Everyone is coming today, right? Is Ji-Hoon also coming? Has anyone talked to him?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Choi Byeong-Hee: Why? He is in this group chat.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Ugh, I lent him twenty million won because he begged so much, but I haven’t been able to reach him since then.</p>
<p>&lt;Choi Byeong-Hee: Twenty million? You are fucking dumb, too.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Hyo-Seob: Tsk tsk. Don’t you know that he gambles a lot? You should have asked me. When was it?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Around Chuseok[2] last year.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kwon Jin-Won: I can’t make it because I have to watch my baby. My wife won’t let me go. Have fun guys.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Does anyone know his whereabouts?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Hyo-Seob: He must have run away. Yo, but I think Ji-Hoon is reading all these. That’s right. This dude is reading but not responding. Fucking asshole.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Kim Ji-Hoon, why are you still living like that? You are old enough to live better.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Hyo-Seob: Ji-Hoon is such an idiot. Grow up, man.&gt;</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon, who was reading the messages, began to type with a snort.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Ji-Hoon: I didn’t run away.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Hey.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Hyo-Seob: Danggg.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: You motherfucker.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Ji-Hoon: lmao you guys are all the same.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: All the same? Are you fucking crazy? Sinchon Tuna Restaurant at eleven o’clock. Come here right now. Let’s talk face-to-face. &gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Choi Byeong-Hee: Calm down.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Hyo-Seob: Ji-Hoon, just apologize and tell him when you will pay back the money. What’s wrong with you? You know him well.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: Tell me the truth. Where did you spend all that money? You were lying that you spent on your father’s hospital bills, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Ji-Hoon: Let me ask you one thing. Why did you trust me enough to lend me that much money back then?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh Soo-Il: This fucker.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Ji-Hoon: Did you really think that you would get the money back from me?&gt;</p>
<p>It was a digital chat room, but everyone could feel the silence. No one spoke up for him, and the bitter smile on Kim Ji-Hoon’s lips was getting thicker.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Ji-Hoon: It’s because I’m thankful. Please wait a little longer.&gt;</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon felt as though the bonds that had been holding him down had somehow been lifted. This was likely due to his anticipation of venturing into the mainland of the aliens. The land of the elves…</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Ji-Hoon: I will give it back to you with lots of interest.&gt;</p>
<p>He then sniggered. “Who knows? I might get you an elf.”</p>

<p>Chapter 348</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly usually began its session once a year on the third Tuesday of September. However, a separate meeting could be convened if there was a special agenda to discuss, and there was a UN Emergency General Assembly this year.</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: Yes, I will take that into account.&gt;</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han could hear the situations that had occurred in the association’s headquarters through the phone call with Odin. Creatures resembling those commonly found in human mythology and fantasy had infiltrated the headquarters, and their attempt to disrupt the ritual suggested that time was running out.</p>
<p>He started revising his speech after hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>「I am honored to stand before you today to discuss a monumental moment in our history. The defeat of the alien invasion on the Day of Advent was not just a triumph for our nation, but for the entire world. It was a spiritual achievement that should be acknowledged as such by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The repulsion of the alien invasion was no small feat. It was the result of the tireless efforts of our Awakened as well as the strength and determination of all humankind.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I urge and appeal to the leaders of the United Nations, including the esteemed members of the Security Council, as well as leaders across the globe. The core principles of the security community, enshrined within the UN Charter, must be manifested throughout the world. To that end, it is imperative that the World Awakening Association serves as the vanguard for realizing this shared goal of global peace, for it is precisely in such a capacity that its vital contribution is most urgently required.」</p>
<p>At that time, a guest came to the room where he was waiting. It was Catalina Ronea. She was a world-famous movie star before becoming an Awakened, but now she was a mere low-level Awakened who was taking full advantage of her celebrity fame.</p>
<p>She took all kinds of interviews and published her memoirs before anyone else. She was also good at hiding a viper-like expression unique to the Awakened behind a fake smile. Despite her low-level, she was spreading a reputation as a competent Awakened among the civilians.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no one stopped her because she was playing an important role in repairing the Awakened’s tarnished reputation. It seemed she had earned the trust of even the most skeptical individuals in the public. In fact, Lee Tae-Han himself had recommended her as the ideal candidate to become the next speaker.</p>
<p>Catalina straightened her back and put her hands together in front of her stomach. She was always bright and pleasant when talking to the media, but her face was stiff when she faced Lee Tae-Han. She was even conscious of blinking her eyes in front of him.</p>
<p>It was their first time meeting each other in person. He approached her while holding a revised speech in his hand. The manner in which he grasped her chin and turned her face from side to side multiple times was reminiscent of someone assessing the quality of a product.</p>
<p>“Smile,” he said.</p>
<p>Catalina’s stoic face immediately broke into a smile. All Awakened in the lower sections had the habit of smiling or employing sexual tactics when someone pressed their buttons. They had no choice but to learn the skill to survive.</p>
<p>However, her smiling face at that moment wasn’t that beautiful because Lee Tae-Han was forcefully gripping her face. Despite the pain she was experiencing, she continued to smile while quivering. Her face was unnaturally serene, lacking any indication of discomfort or agony. Only her blonde hair swayed as a result of Lee Tae-Han’s touch.</p>
<p>He commanded, “Cry while smiling.”</p>
<p>Following that, Lee Tae-Han checked her various facial expressions. While there were directors who could coach speech writing, coordination, and presentation intonation, in this case, Lee Tae-Han was doing the teaching as there were two issues that would bring a huge impact. One was the agreement between the World Awakened Association and UN member states, and the other was about the extraterrestrial space that the Awakened would enter soon.</p>
<p>Therefore, he had to pay close attention and be responsible for everything.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sinchon, Seoul, South Korea.</p>
<p>“Kim Ji-Hoon, that motherfucker is hopeless. There is nothing much we can do. Just give up. You will never be able to get it from that bastard.”</p>
<p>This was their first time meeting since the world had gone crazy. One fortunate thing was that none of his friends were dragged to the Stage of Advent. Those who were unable to attend didn’t do so for various reasons such as their wives not allowing them to go, attending job interviews in Busan, or owing large sums of money to their friends.</p>
<p>“People say don’t lend money even to parents and siblings. But Ji-Hoon? Gosh, Soo-Il. What made you lend that much to him?”</p>
<p>Soo-Il groaned. “His father’s hospital bill… Ugh. Let’s stop talking about this. I am an idiot.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just say it was bad luck. God might have seen you being nice and didn’t drag you into the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>It was safe to say that most of the people who were sent to the Stage of Advent had died there because fewer than two hundred thousand of the original forty-five million people returned. Also, the association announced that there were fewer than two hundred Awakened in Korea.</p>
<p>He grimaced. “Yes, I’m an idiot.”</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il couldn’t help but sigh whenever he thought of Kim Ji-Hoon. It wasn’t only because of money. Of course, his heart ached when he thought about the money, but it couldn’t be more painful than Kim Ji-Hoon’s life. The more he thought about him, the more he felt sorry for him. Whenever things were about to work well, his father interfered every time.</p>
<p>His life had been like that for more than thirty years. Oh Soo-Il couldn’t forget the last word Kim Ji-Hoon said as he worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet. He said it was becoming increasingly challenging to secure new part-time jobs as he was getting older. He then proceeded to ask for money.</p>
<p>Of course, not all parents were loving and caring. In many cases, they were worse than enemies.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il tilted his soju glass as he recalled his memories in middle school.</p>
<p>“It was a mess back then.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t talking about the Day of Advent. There was a period of time that they always talked about when drinking. It was the day when their grade 8 homeroom teacher’s mother came to school and made a fuss. She ran wild while calling her daughter “crazy.” The school ended up kicking the daughter out.</p>
<p>“Woo Yeon-Hee wasn’t crazy. Wasn’t her mother the crazy one?”</p>
<p>“She shouldn’t be called by the word ‘mother.’ Her actions have become even more absurd to me now that I have kids. By the way, don’t you guys miss that time?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“That was the best year of my life.”</p>
<p>“We were too mean, haha. We didn’t even open a textbook during class.”</p>
<p>“Yo, take a shot.”</p>
<p>Their soju glasses clinked.</p>
<p>“But even if that guy went into the Stage of Advent, I feel like he would have survived somehow. I was so nervous in front of him. He was different from us.”</p>
<p>“Na Seon-Hu?”</p>
<p>“You were the one who chickened out the most, bruh.”</p>
<p>“Hey, you were the same as well.”</p>
<p>This was why Oh Soo-Il liked his middle school reunion the most. Everything was a good memory, free from any concerns that he had to be careful in what he said. Everyone spoke freely and laughed without a care in the world. They talked about the same thing every year, but he always had so much fun.</p>
<p>When they were tipsy, they began talking about how they were forcefully dragged to the martial law forces on the Day of Advent. When they took another shot, they were comparing the installed applications on their phones. Those who didn’t install certain applications mentioned a website that dealt with the same content.</p>
<p>The world hadn’t changed much for them, so the topics of their conversations revolved around trivial matters. The Awakened and alien monsters sounded as unreal to them as North Korea’s fat dictator who existed but was deemed as a cartoon character. They didn’t exist in the reality of Oh Soo-Il and others.</p>
<p>“Let’s watch this first. Lee Tae-Han is coming out,” Oh Soo-Il said while putting his smartphone on the table.</p>
<p>「Lee Tae-Han’s, the President of the World Awakened Association: “The defeat of the alien invasion was a brilliant achievement of the United Nations.” &lt;Live&gt;」</p>
<p>“He is fluent in English. He must have learned it in the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>“He was already good at it. Ah, I should have bought Ilseong stocks earlier.”</p>
<p>「 “The role and contribution of the United Nation in the international community will grow.” 」</p>
<p>“Yo, stop talking about stocks. I don’t want to think about it.”</p>
<p>“Did you lose a lot? They are going up again these days.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, I sold everything when China went crazy. I can’t even bring it up to my wife. Lend me two thousand too. I will pay you back with interest, haha.”</p>
<p>“Interest worth twenty years?”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, don’t even think of touching the stock market, dude.”</p>
<p>「 “The microchip will be implanted in the Awakened as scheduled two days later, on the registration day ” 」</p>
<p>“Of course, they should.”</p>
<p>“Would you say the same thing if you were Awakened?”</p>
<p>“I’m not. Heheheheheh. Let’s order more food. Excuse me, ma’am. One more fish soup and soju, please!”</p>
<p>「 “Thank you for the international community’s support and interest in our association.” 」</p>
<p>“Lee Tae-Han looks like he’s gotten younger somehow.”</p>
<p>“He should shut up and show us his skills, ugh.”</p>
<p>“Then, he will destroy that podium.”</p>
<p>“Is he in the challenger section?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why he is the president? I envy him so much. Fuck. He has money and a superpower. He is also pretty young. I want to live as him at least for one day.”</p>
<p>「 “The World Awakened Association requires a crucial need for global peace as urged by the United Nations.” 」</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han’s speech ended there, and Catalina Ronea came up to the podium.</p>
<p>「 [UN General Assembly] Awakened Catalina Ronea &lt;Live&gt; 」</p>
<p>“I can’t stop watching videos of her these days. She said the Stage of Advent was like hell.”</p>
<p>“At least, she survived.”</p>
<p>“Is she going to rely on special effects in her next film? It will be dope if she actually uses her skills.”</p>
<p>“Why is she crying? Did Lee Tae-Han scold her with his fire bat? I heard the Awakened have such intense sexual energy.”</p>
<p>“Ew, don’t even imagine that.”</p>
<p>「 Awakened Catalina Ronea: “What happened at the headquarters of the World Awakened Association was the result of the invasion of a new alien species. Our heartbreaking condolences to the victims and their families.” 」</p>
<p>「 Breaking News: Catalina Ronea Claims There Was an Alien Attack at World Awakened Association's General Headquarters 」</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il and his friends suddenly felt completely sober. The smiles on their faces disappeared as well because they realized that they would have to wear a military uniform again.</p>
<p>People at other tables began to speak noisily. Oh Soo-Il didn’t understand English, but he increased the volume of the phone.</p>
<p>「 “What is certain is that there should be no more damage and humans dying from extraterrestrial raids” 」</p>
<p>「 “The association is rushing to advance into outer space where the attack began.” 」</p>
<p>No one was giggling anymore. Wearing a military uniform itself was a pain on the Day of Advent. In addition, the sociopathic orders of their bosses at work was much better compared to being instructed by their martial law military superiors.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il was scared.</p>
<p>The images of what appeared to be new alien species were being displayed on the monitor. Whenever Catalina Ronea picked up the printed photos one by one, the camera zoomed into the pictures.</p>
<p>「 “New extraterrestrial invaders resemble humans.” 」</p>
<p>「 “Other species that resemble our imaginary creations, such as elves and dwarves, were found.” 」</p>
<p>「 “If the attackers are similar to mankind, unlike alien monsters on the Day of Advent, it is even more painful and sad.” 」</p>
<p>The photo revealed dead bodies and their severed limbs. Most of the gruesome details were hidden by mosaics, but their sharp ears and blunt noses were exposed.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il said while his lips trembled, “I should go home. You guys are going, right?”</p>
<p>They were definitely sober. Even though it was his first time standing after drinking so much, he wasn’t stumbling at all.</p>
<p>“Hey… We would have been dragged already if they were to do so. The Ministry of National Defense is evil.”</p>
<p>“...We don’t know that yet.”</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il sat down again as his friends looked at him in bewilderment.</p>
<p>「 “That’s why it’s time to boldly take a leap forward for peace.” 」</p>
<p>「 “Full support of United Nations member states and citizens of the world are desperately needed.” 」</p>
<p>The time was passing by. Catalina had finished her speech, but Oh Soo-Il and his friends were just swallowing their saliva with blank looks in their eyes. The screen turned from the scene of the busy United Nations General Assembly to a Korean announcer sitting in a studio.</p>
<p>「 Breaking News: The World Awakened Association President, Lee Tae-Han, Proposed a Membership Agreement Between the World Awakened Association and UN Member States 」</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il didn’t know what that was, but things were going quite urgently.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I can pay you back now. You can take it or sell it.”</p>
<p>As those words were spoken, a hand firmly grasped Oh Soo-Il’s shoulder, holding a car key. Oh Soo-Il looked up and shouted reflexively.</p>
<p>“You! Kim Ji…”</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t finish his words because he realized something as he looked into the eyes that looked down at him. The guy wasn’t the poor bastard who took money from him last Chuseok. This guy’s eyes were filled with a kind of confidence to an extreme extent that they felt aggressive.</p>
<p>“I told you I would give it back with twenty years worth of interest.”</p>
<p>Twenty years' worth of interest?</p>
<p>When Oh Soo-Il received a message from Kim Ji-Hoon previously, he believed that the other man had made something up to avoid the situation. However, Oh Soo-Il soon realized that Ji-Hoon was indeed an Awakened, having returned from a place that had been described as hell.</p>

<p>Writer: Exuviation</p>
<p>It must sound unfamiliar, but our country is actually used to such an agreement. I’m sure everyone has heard of the Status of Forces Agreement at least once.</p>
<p>So basically, the status agreement on the members of the World Awakened Association goes way beyond what’s in the SOFA agreement. It’s not just unfair; it’s like we gave up our sovereignty to them. Why? Because the agreement only gives them rights, but doesn’t require them to have obligations in return.</p>
<p>Also, if you read it closely, it doesn’t even specify what rights they have or which organizations have a responsibility to coordinate the government and the association’s opinions. It’s crazy, but if they ask for the whole city of Seoul, we’d have to give it to them and pay for the military to protect it as well.</p>
<p>What’s terrifying about this agreement is that such an oppressive agreement took place all over the world. The World Awakened Association seems to be talking about peace to the public and volunteers as human’s shields, but they have established their own kingdom throughout the world.</p>
<p>Things that will happen in the future are obvious. As the Awakened start to think they can get away with crime and won’t face serious consequences, they will become more violent. Even if the association doesn’t punish them, we will call them out on it, but we won’t be able to stop them. That’s the power the association holds.</p>
<p>Soon the association will interfere in the internal affairs of countries around the world under the pretext of saving humanity. Because of that, the anti-Awakened sensation will inevitably escalate.</p>
<p>Wait and see.</p>
<p>So this agreement needs to be revised as soon as possible for the sake of the harmony between the Awakened and mankind. This agreement has gone too far. It’s a completely insane agreement.」</p>

<p>└ Alom ^~^: It’s not a normal situation. I think you are saying something we could have done before the Day of Advent. I’m actually more relieved with this agreement. To enable the association to take initiative, we need to create such an environment, and that’s what this agreement does.</p>
<p>└ Yoo Seung-Min: Wow, what a genius you are. Then, you should go to alien space on behalf of the Awakened.</p>
<p>└ Jeong Chang-Seok: I don’t trust the Awakened, but I believe in the association. Look at their decision in implanting microchips in the Awakened. It’s too early to argue about the agreement now. I mean, it’s not time to talk about harmony yet.</p>
<p>└ Writer: The association is doing well, but I wanted to highlight that the rights they were given are pretty absurd. By the way, the reason we have less trouble with Awakened in Korea is that we don’t have as many of them as in other countries. Plus, some of the Korean Awakened, like Lee Tae-Han, the President of the Association, and Caliber Kwon Seong-Il, hold high positions.</p>
<p>However, look at Japan. There was an occasion when their capital city Tokyo was smashed by the Awakened. Not many know about it because the Japanese authorities shut them up. Many people were swept to death. This agreement will further increase the crime rate of the Awakened.</p>

<p>1. The World Awakened Association</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact, but Jeonil Resort was where the first speech of Osiris, Joshua von Karjan, who was the former president, was held.</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Joshua von Karjan, Press Conference / KTN&gt;</p>
<p>That’s the current location of the association’s headquarters. In other words, the entire world has confirmed our country as a mecca for Awakened even before the Day of Advent. When we ridiculed Korea as the Hell Peninsula, our country was emerging as the center of the world.</p>
<p>2. Caliber Kwon Seong-Il and Association President Lee Tae-Han</p>
<p>The status order of Awakened is clear as it is structured in a pyramid. That is why there are fewer incidents even though the mentally traumatized Awakened returned from the Stage of Advent. If they violate the association’s instructions, then they would get killed instantly. They are called killing machines, but the known incidents are very minor problems compared to the actual power they possess.</p>
<p>At the top of the pyramid are the leaders of the association who are in the challenger section. By the way, it’s not the number of Awakened in each country that matters. There is an overwhelming barrier between sections and levels, and one Awakened in the challenger section can overpower thousands of Bsilgol[1] with one hand. It’s not just my personal opinion but an actual fact.</p>
<p>There are already two Korean Awakened who are confirmed to be in the challenger section, Caliber Kwon Seong-Il and the Association President Lee Tae-Han. I can bet my entire net worth that there are fewer than ten Awakened in the challenger section worldwide. That is why the Awakened are afraid of Lee Tae-Han’s orders.</p>
<p>3. The Facts Revealed in Several Interviews, including Catalina Ronea’s</p>
<p>Those who have closely watched interviews of Awakened may have noticed that our country is being mentioned a lot. There are many warnings disguised as advice.</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Catalina Ronea “Countries around the world should be careful in treating Korea.”&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Confession of an Awakened in the diamond section “Korea is the sanctuary of the Awakened in the world.”&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Link: What happened in the Final Stage?&gt;</p>
<p>These are the videos that I put information together on my channel.</p>
<p>4. Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s Nature</p>
<p>As you are all aware, the Awakened have endured significant physical and psychological trauma over the years, due to their battles against alien creatures. On top of that, the System tricked them by giving them malicious quests, leaving them with no option but to face danger while grappling with the emotional toll of their experiences.</p>
<p>However, Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s nature was a hot topic recently.</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Caliber Kwon Seong-Il in boxers. He is just a normal guy scratching his butt? But his body reminds us of Hulk.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Caliber Kwon Seong-Il “Soju is the best.” An Awakened in the challenger section was pleasantly drunk.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s position on the Japanese Awakened Incident “Fuck. They should have stayed home, drinking soju. They aren’t even that strong…”&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Link: Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s fatherly smile&gt;</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have such an Awakened in our country, and we can anticipate a bright future for Korea. Lastly, if you visit my channel, you will find more videos to enjoy.</p>

Given the attention your channel has garnered, it is possible for you to become the world’s leading creator by establishing a professional studio and enlisting the services of translators and editors. I have so many ideas as an experienced editor. Please check my message, Young Master. No, Ki-Cheol. Please, I’m begging you. It’s because you have so much potential.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I know,” Ki-Cheol sighed.</p>
<p>Invincible Caliber TV broke Catalina Ronea’s record of surpassing ten million subscribers in the shortest period of time. Ki-Cheol started filming videos when he followed his father to the association headquarters. He posted videos because he was bored in an empty room and got pissed by people talking shit about Awakened.</p>
<p>In fact, Yong-Joo encouraged him to do so through messenger. As time went on, Ki-Cheol found himself increasingly drawn to the task. He took pleasure in seeing people who had previously spoken ill of his father now leaving heart emojis in response to his content, and he relished the growing number of subscribers and views that were skyrocketing day by day.</p>
<p>Therefore, he still worked on this even after returning to his mother’s house about a week ago with Yong-Joo.</p>
<p>“Should I… contact him secretly?” Ki-Cheol asked Yong-Joo as quietly as possible about the contact information that was sent by Expert.</p>
<p>“I heard other creators all have editors. Only we don’t. Our videos should get better when we have a chance, so it’s a waste if we stay like this without trying anything,” Yong-Joo replied.</p>
<p>The two looked at the living room. As expected, the Awakened with high Sense was already ratting on a man in a black suit. Jamie Yang, the President of Jeonil Group, has assigned a guy in a black suit for Ki-Cheol’s safety. Ki-Cheol and Yong-Joo called him ‘Black Suit’ because he stopped them from doing anything. The two of them were just mice in front of a cat.</p>
<p>Black Suit shook his head. “You guys can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Dude, please.”</p>
<p>The man was firm. “No, you shouldn’t. Please keep your promise to the chairman.”</p>
<p>“Things are so much different now… I have more than ten million subscribers. Other foreigners are taking away all my stuff.”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo whispered, “Ask when your father is coming. We should film more videos.”</p>
<p>“When is my dad coming back? Is he flying on a dragon or something?” Ki-Cheol asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything,” the Black Suit replied with a poker face.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol pestered him persistently, “But you can call him.”</p>
<p>“I have no authority to do so.”</p>
<p>“Not even to Jamie? Then, I will go back to the headquarters with Yong-Joo. I heard the raid is over.”</p>
<p>“No,” The Black Suit was strict.</p>
<p>“You might not understand this, but this is a jackpot! Jamie would know, so please call her.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Then, Ki-Cheol suddenly remembered the wish coupon, but it was too wasteful to use it for such a thing.</p>
<p>Elves and Dwarves… The world of witchcraft and swords actually existed somewhere in outer space, so using the coupon on hiring an editor was…</p>
<p>As Ki-Cheol let out a sigh and waited for the Black Suit to leave, Yong-Joo stole a glance at the Black Suit and said, “We have reached twelve million now…”</p>

<p>Chapter 350</p>
<p>Although the agreement between the World Awakened Association and the United Nations was a matter that was decided already within the club, we had to explain it to the public. It should have appeared to have passed through a fierce consensus debate and a plausible justification as the public were not fools.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the work, Lee Tae-Han flew back to Korea last night. He and I were watching the whole world at the moment.</p>
<p>Today was the registration day for the Awakened. It was natural that the world’s attention was focused on the association as the Awakened had been busy hiding their whereabouts. That was why all kinds of media were buzzing in most of the languages on earth including Korean, English, German, French, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish.</p>
<p>In Korea, the time was early morning, while in some other places, it was already daytime, and in others, dawn. The registration was scheduled to start at 9 AM Korean time and continued until midnight the following day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Korean media focused their attention on the association’s branch which was located in Seoul. Even prior to the emergence of the Awakened, the press had already positioned their cameras outside the designated photo line, aimed at the building. The reporters on site exchanged opinions with the studio over two conflicting issues: the agreement that went into effect yesterday and the transplant of microchips.</p>
<p>The first Korean Awakened who appeared was Kim Ji-Hoon. He communicated with the association security guards in the restricted area by rolling down his car window, and the entire interaction was captured by cameras in live videos.</p>
<p>He definitely expected that the public’s attention would be focused on the Awakened. As he left the items in the association’s storage box and turned around, people could see him dressed in a suit with freshly waxed hair. This could have never happened in the past.</p>
<p>Anyway, no one would have noticed him as an Awakened if he hadn’t crossed the controlled area. His gaze calmly swept over the cameras. Although the association had not issued any particular instructions, the Awakened had probably come to a consensus to avoid even speaking unnecessarily. Once Ji-Ae noona arrived, the atmosphere resembled that of a courtroom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the situation was similar in other countries as there was no conflict between the Awakened, which was contrary to some people’s expectations. There was an implicit rule that even if they met an enemy no fights should break out today.</p>
<p>The Awakened had become cognizant that public perception towards them had gradually soured, prompting them to avoid actions that clashed with the association’s desires. Since they were well aware of the association’s authority, they refrained from any such behavior. Additionally, they were conscious of my anger since many of them had attempted to assassinate Yeon-Hee during the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>As a result, the Awakened had become adept at the art of survival, recognizing the need to establish their safety on Earth before venturing into space. They had already become skilled at concealing their true identities and patiently waiting for opportune moments.</p>
<p>Their focus on personal refinement and avoidance of fights with the outside world stemmed from their innate survival instincts. They had to remain like that under the cameras that broadcasted them worldwide. At least right here on the registration day…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The first registration procedure was microchip implantation. People guided the Awakened there even without asking for their names or levels.</p>
<p>“It’s going to sting.”</p>
<p>She expected this, but the feeling of the microchip being planted under her skin was disgusting. Kim Ji-Ae felt like something more fatal than the Graf Clan’s poison was being planted under her triceps. Nevertheless, she couldn’t violate the association’s rule.</p>
<p>The agreement between the association and the UN member states bore his will. He intended to systematically manage the Awakened within the association, placing them directly under his feet.</p>
<p>In other words, those who disobeyed his orders, such as not registering themselves, wouldn’t be able to avoid punishment. The unregistered Awakened wouldn’t be able to progress to the fantasy world. Thus, they would suffer for a lifetime as they had to constantly run away from the association and face the associated consequences.</p>
<p>If a Chaser squad was to be established, Kim Ji-Ae definitely wanted to apply for it. She believed that if she was contemplating entering the extraterrestrial realm, then she had to be a part of the Chaser squad at any cost.</p>
<p>This was because she had a hunch that the association would concentrate its power within the team, which not only penalized the unregistered Awakened but also executed the registered ones who dared to oppose the association.</p>
<p>Besides her blood relation with Seon-Hu, her previous role as the head of the Public Security Department of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office and her current status being in the master section, suggested that she might be able to occupy the leader position of the Chaser squad. That was why she hadn’t returned to her old job.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae followed the person guiding her, and Kim Ji-Hoon was in the process of registering in a separate room. Then, he made eye contact with her and lowered his head slightly.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae faced the association staff who had a computer in front of him. Despite the short amount of time they had, the association had set a system throughout the world. They scouted elites through headhunting[1] and quickly hired assistants through interviews. The buildings and resources that were needed to serve as branches of each country were also prepared early on.</p>
<p>As expected, Odin was thorough. He definitely had planned everything before entering the Stage of Advent. If not, things couldn’t have been this perfect!</p>
<p>“My name is Yoo Won-Jin, and I will help you register today. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>Odin had also completed training employees already. They were nervous in front of the Awakened, but not to the extent that their fear affected their job performance.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae thought the elite vibe coming off from the employee was boring. He likely had moved from the Jeonil Group’s headquarters, a major company, or a public office. The reason why she was confident about that was that he recognized her. Knowing the face of the former chief public security officer of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office meant that he had been in a high position.</p>
<p>“Have we met before?” she asked.</p>
<p>He smiled. “It’s natural that you don’t remember me. I was in the legal office of Daehyun Group. We met at your office once.”</p>
<p>He would have been at least a team leader or a senior at the Judicial Research and Training Institute that she used to attend. If so, then he would have known much about her. She was particularly worried about the rumors spreading regarding her family's dependence on her uncle for financial assistance while living in Jeonil.</p>
<p>“We, the Awakened, were granted a new life during the Stage of Advent, and even after our return, we still have that life,” Ji-Ae said.</p>
<p>“You must have gone through a lot. I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“But you seem to have started a new life too. Are association employees also considered as members?”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae believed the reason why this middle-aged man had abandoned his original social status and moved to the association was that they guaranteed enormous benefits.</p>
<p>‘Agreement?!</p>
<p>However, the timing wasn’t right. Daehyun Group’s legal team wouldn’t have known something that she didn’t, so he might have decided to go on an adventure. He took a gamble on himself and jumped into the World Awakened Association.</p>
<p>When Kim Ji-Ae looked around, there were few elites like him.</p>
<p>“Yes, the association members are divided into two groups: rank-and-file[2] members and Awakened members. Among our employees, those who can directly deal with the Awakened were able to join the association as rank-and-file members.”</p>
<p>The staff slightly raised his right arm. He glanced at the area where the microchip was embedded, then smiled in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae replied, “The Stage of Advent was like that too. A decision made today could determine tomorrow’s life and death. Your name is Yoo Won-Jin, right? Congratulations. You have succeeded in entering our world even without going through the stage.”</p>
<p>Her words stung, but the staff smiled.</p>
<p>“Haha… Thank you very much. I will wholeheartedly support you. Before we get started, I will tell you some precautions. This is a formal process that every Awakened goes through, so don’t worry about it too much. Please listen to it for your own knowledge.”</p>
<p>First, there would be consequences if the Awakened registered any false information. The actual verification of the registered information would be carried out soon. Second, voluntary withdrawal from the association was impossible. Third, the employees in charge of the registration would be an exclusive window of the association in the future.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae thought after listening to him until that point.</p>
<p>He is not just bold but lucky. He is in charge of me. I must be one of the top Awakened who is getting implanted with a microchip.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that Odin and the other leaders would get microchipped. Even if Odin was considerate and told her to remove the chip, she intended to politely express her refusal. She needed to take the initiative as a future leader of the Chaser squad, so she would not be using her blood relation status with him to get an unfair advantage</p>
<p>“I already know your name, but I hope you understand. May I have your name, please? If you have a code name, please let me know as well. If you don’t, I’d appreciate it if you could make one now.”</p>
<p>“Kim Ji-Ae. Code name: Sekhmet[3].”</p>
<p>“Which section and level are you in?” he asked politely.</p>
<p>She responded, “Master section. Level four hundred fifty-two.”</p>
<p>The staff paused for a second, then quickly began to enter data with a businesslike expression.</p>
<p>“We will proceed in the order of traits, skills, items, and insignias. What traits do you have?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The association’s central server received the registration details and pertinent information of the Awakened. Watching the numbers increase reminded me of my past battling in economic wars alongside Jonathan. At that time, we were constantly monitoring figures on various displays. We were so busy that we couldn’t afford to assume any unforeseen situations back then.</p>
<p>However, what Lee Tae-Han and I were concerned about now wasn’t the Awakened. Those who were on top of our nerves were surveilled by the association’s security team. We had installed a security system equivalent to the service that was used by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, so I didn’t think there would be an issue with cyber units owned by the military of each country.</p>
<p>However, hackers who moved annoyingly into private organizations were the problem. They were the skinny ones with freckles and chubby guys who lived with donuts in their mouths. I was confident that they worked as security directors in Silicon Valley during the day and as members of a hacker organization at night. They were my biggest concern.</p>
<p>Just like how Orca kept the bodies of the five key members of the invasion team as trophies, the Association’s server was considered a trophy by those within the hacker organization.</p>
<p>I was well acquainted with their habits because I had previous experience hiring them to breach the servers of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. That was also the reason why the association’s security team was desperately protecting the system as they had also worked as hackers before.</p>
<p>Of course, it was extremely dangerous to attack our servers now that the agreement between the association and the UN member states had come into effect because we had jurisdiction. If we captured them, then it wouldn’t be as if we’d merely confine them within their homes and block their access to electronic devices. No, they’d be subjected to more punishment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Tae-Han had zero knowledge of this field. He didn’t understand the reports from the security team, so he was listening to my explanation. He looked at me as if he was wondering how I knew all this.</p>
<p>As time elapsed, the evening arrived. I heard the voice contacting me through telepathy which made my heart flutter. It was a voice that I had wanted to hear for a long time.</p>
<p>- I’m done! Can I go there? I miss you so much, Seon-Hu!</p>

<p>Chapter 351</p>
<p>Soward’s outstanding shooter colleagues had all either contracted with an organization called Cat Food Warehouse, which was considered the government’s secret agency, or devoted themselves to the FBI or the military. However, she chose the CIA because its vision matched her ideals. Compared to other groups, she was guaranteed her own discretion when completing missions for the CIA.</p>
<p>The sick man lying in the bed asked Soward, “How…did you find me?”</p>
<p>A disgusting stench permeated this room, but it wasn’t coming from his breath. Instead, it came from the bandage that was wrapped around his heavily injured face. He had been changing the dressing on his left eyeball whenever pus and blood would flow out, and the odor emanating from the wound was extremely strong.</p>
<p>Soward was aware that he was suffering from a type of plague, but it wasn’t a disease found on Earth. From what she knew, Osiris’s squad members were primarily the Awakened who dealt with the plague, but he was definitely not one of them as they were in Korea now. They always followed Osiris wherever he was.</p>
<p>Therefore, Blood, who had recently expanded his scope beyond LA to the entire state of California, was likely to be an American Awakened. He also appeared to be the person who was also handling the plague.</p>
<p>“Get out of my house right now. I don’t talk to the FBI!” the man yelled at Soward.</p>
<p>She responded, “If I were the FBI, then I wouldn’t have been this nice. The FBI would scorn you by shouting that they would send you to jail, but I’ll pay you. I compensate those who share precious information with me.”</p>
<p>She threw an envelope toward the man’s bedside. As soon as it fell on the bed, several dollar bills spilled out of the thick envelope that was filled with dozens of bills.</p>
<p>“We never ask informants to testify in court. All you need to do is to point at some things and then take the money. I don’t care if you spend that on buying drugs or somewhere stupid.”</p>
<p>“...Point at things?”</p>
<p>Soward glanced at the television, which was revealing a chaotic scene. There were civilians treating the Awakened like celebrities, protestors condemning the violation of human rights in microchip transplants, a minority denouncing the crimes committed by the Awakened, and various media outlets competing to cover as many scenes as possible. The noise of what was going on showed just how overwhelming it was.</p>
<p>Soward said, “Just point if an Awakened named Blood appears. That’s your duty for now.”</p>
<p>“What the heck… are you talking about? B…Blood?” he stuttered.</p>
<p>“You might not have grasped the situation, but you are no different than a dead man. Tsk tsk.”</p>
<p>Soward clicked her tongue loudly as if she wanted him to hear her. Then, she opened a picture on her smartphone and shoved it into the guy’s face. The picture was hideous, and the guy had seen several sickening scenes like that before.</p>
<p>When he had put the dead body in a container filled with hydrochloric acid after committing a murder, the body was crushed, resembling the image. However, it resulted in a mushy mass of meat as it didn’t fully dissolve in the liquid. Then, he buried the meat in the wasteland and covered it with cement such that wild animals wouldn't smell it.</p>
<p>Despite the task being cumbersome, it was the perfect way to dispose of and hide the body from others.</p>
<p>“Why are you showing me this?” he asked.</p>
<p>Soward stated coldly, “This is what you will look like in five days. Every single part of your body will melt. A few hours later after I leave, you wouldn’t even be able to see anything. You wouldn’t even have a tongue left to scream. Well, no one will hear you even if you scream.”</p>
<p>Soward also added that the man’s hiding place was excellent.</p>
<p>“...Fuck off. Do you think I’ll even flinch at your words?”</p>
<p>She smiled grimly. “Blood must have said the same thing yesterday, right? But what was the result? You lost your men, and you have become nothing but a guy with the plague.”</p>
<p>He snapped, “Were you there? Fucking FBI. You guys were watching everything, but pretended that you didn’t see anything?”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, I’m not from the FBI. You are deaf.”</p>
<p>Soward shifted her gaze towards the television, which had grown louder. Whenever a well-known figure from the Awakened community - be it a sports star or a celebrity - was featured as Awakened, the commotion among the people intensified.</p>
<p>All the cameras were focusing on one Awakened, and Soward also knew him. The 49ers quarterback appeared in a suit. She wondered if he spent years leading a group in the Stage of Advent due to the nature of a quarterback leading a team’s attack.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t seem like it as he paid tribute to another Awakened who appeared at the same time. The hierarchy of the Awakened was being revealed right there.</p>
<p>At that time, she heard a trembling voice from the bed.</p>
<p>“Hey, you. Can you fix me?” he asked.</p>
<p>Soward turned her head around with a smile.</p>
<p>“If you cooperate faithfully, I will connect you to a healer. So I advise you to save your money and spend it then.”</p>
<p>At that moment, her attitude did a complete 180. Unlike before when she simply asked him to point out Blood, she now demanded that he explain exactly what was going on. It was hard to get a full picture through wiretapping alone.</p>
<p>There had been multiple incidents caused by the Awakened in the past month, but Blood was the central figure of the major incidents. This wasn’t only because he had quickly gained control over the drug gangs in LA and expanded his influence throughout California. It was also because new drugs were being distributed with LA as the epicenter.</p>
<p>Soward already knew that monster blood contained ingredients that caused negative hallucinations, but Blood’s drugs seemed to have been evolving over time even though they were based on it.</p>
<p>The latest variety of medication in circulation was significantly more potent than the first one. Within a mere month of its release, it had proven to be the most effective in alleviating pain and decreasing adverse hallucinations. Furthermore, it also enhanced the user’s physical capabilities.</p>
<p>Drugs were originally under the jurisdiction of the Drug Investigation Agency (DEA), but this was why Soward was tracking Blood and his drugs. Blood put the drug into circulation not because he wanted to make a profit.</p>
<p>‘He was testing the drugs on the drug addicts.’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the FBI was a much larger entity than the CIA. Nevertheless, their approach to investigations was inherently limited, given the relatively few intelligence reports they received. On the other hand, the CIA’s focus on preserving individual privacy necessitated the acquisition of vast amounts of information, which served to reinforce their intelligence system.</p>
<p>That was why Soward was devoted to paperwork, which the FBI would consider to be trivial. She had received all the clues and figured out who Blood was. She also added her personal opinion that Blood was absorbing drug gangs into his own for the purposes of testing new drugs instead of trying to make a profit.</p>
<p>Since approaching the Awakened was dangerous, her investigation was conducted only through informants. However, she was confident that her paper would attract Langley’s attention who was on the seventh floor.</p>
<p>However, she hesitated before sending the report because she thought the people on the seventh floor would use this information on a political matter.</p>
<p>‘Wouldn’t it be better to wait a bit more?’</p>
<p>The FBI was politically active and had deep ties to Congress, and the CIA had also taken the same path in recent years. She was perplexed by the reason for this change, but Langley frequently received visits from Washington politicians. The head of a department even made frequent trips to meet with him.</p>
<p>Soward looked at those coming into the building with a serious look. This time, Washington’s big-name politicians, including the head of the department, were pouring in at once.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Soward asked her co-worker.</p>
<p>The person responded quizzically, “Have you not heard about that yet?”</p>
<p>Soward pretended to type instead of responding, creating the impression that she was too preoccupied with her work on the documents to care about others. Then, her co-worker whispered, “The data was leaked.”</p>
<p>Soward immediately gnashed her teeth.</p>
<p>‘Is it Panama again?’</p>
<p>The leak of information from Mossack Fonseca, the tax avoidance firm based in Panama, once caused panic on the seventh floor before. As Wall Street became chaotic, Washington declared a state emergency. It was the CIA’s responsibility to take care of the mess.</p>
<p>At first glance, the current situation was similar to that moment. The nobles, who had previously maintained their composure by threatening war with China just a few days ago, were now visibly angry and blushing with frustration.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the world that wasn’t done by money, but Soward was particularly outraged when it involved black money on Wall Street. Every time she delved into the root cause of the CIA’s deterioration, Wall Street was there.</p>
<p>The financial empires, with Jonathan Investment Finance Group at their core, wielded tremendous monetary influence. Though it was a harsh reality, given the times, it was especially bitter for her to witness the organization she had risked her life for over a decade undergo changes.</p>
<p>Her co-worker continued after reading the concerns on Soward’s face, “It’s not from Wall Street.”</p>
<p>“Then?” she asked tersely.</p>
<p>“It’s from Korea. The World Awakened Association. They found circumstantial evidence that the identity of an Awakened was leaked. Sooner or later…”</p>
<p>He stopped talking as soon as he spotted the deputy director who was heading to the seventh floor approaching Soward along the way.</p>
<p>She followed him into the conference room after he made a gesture at her. The meeting room was still warm as the heated controversy that took place a few minutes ago still remained there. There were only Soward and the director now in the room, but the director frowned as he wasn’t complacent with the meeting.</p>
<p>“These people believe they are warriors fighting for freedom. You know what is going on, right?”</p>
<p>“I heard the association’s server was hacked.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Seeing that multiple hackers attacked at the same time, it must have been planned. The association and Washington are both mad. The hackers must not have a clue of what they have done.”</p>
<p>The director appeared nervous, as evidenced by his frequent glances at his watch while making the statement.</p>
<p>“The data was sent to the site specializing in disclosure, so they will upload a video about it soon.”</p>
<p>“To what extent was the data leaked?”</p>
<p>“His section, level, and nationality. Up to that point. If it had been leaked beyond that, then the association would have actually done something.”</p>
<p>Soward sighed in relief.</p>
<p>‘Thanks to the association, the Awakened are under control. However, if the association starts using force into the international community, things will get hectic like a reckless locomotive.’</p>
<p>The deputy director said, “We have identified the hackers, so we will step in.”</p>
<p>He finally instructed her to proceed to the location and provide support to his team. He actually meant that the CIA needed to take part in the first joint operation without any conditions.</p>
<p>She commented.“The hackers must be Americans.”</p>
<p>He grimaced. “Unfortunately, yes.”</p>
<p>Soward felt bad that the extradition clause under the UN agreement was happening for the first time in her home country. The United States, the world’s most powerful federation, was the first victim of the agreement that sacrificed national sovereignty.</p>
<p>‘Our government will lose ground when the public finds out about Blood.’</p>
<p>Soward frowned as she felt like she had also changed along with the association over the past decade since she was considering her government’s stance.</p>
<p>“Hurry up, when there is room for us.”</p>
<p>“Okay, sir.”</p>
<p>Right when she got in the car to head to the strike force’s marshaling area she accessed the Internet, recalling the anxious look of the deputy director. As she expected, the materials updated on the disclosure website were being covered as breaking news.</p>
<p>“Authoritarian governments are sustained through conspiracies, and the greater the authority and conspiratorial nature of these governments, the more disruptions to the world occur due to the leaking of information. Whistleblowers from around the globe are using the 'power of truth' to bring about change, helping people to see the fallacy of their beliefs in the political elite, financial elite, and national systems, and to abandon their illusions about democracy. In this way, the world is being transformed."</p>
<p>It had been a while since the founder of the disclosure site exiled himself to the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United Kingdom. However, his words still remained on one side of the website to welcome visitors. Soward touched the latest data on the main screen.</p>
<p>「 The World Awakened Association: The Awakened Around the World</p>
<p>April 20th, 2018. We obtained reliable information on the status of an Awakened registered in the World Awakened Association, and we are here to make it public. 」</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>「The World Awakened Association: The Awakened Around the World</p>
<p>From April 18th to 19th of 2018, the World Awakened Association completed the registration of 182,329 Awakened. Lee Tae-Han, the President of the association, stated, “Unregistered Awakened will not have protection under the agreement with the United Nations, and the jurisdiction over them will lie in countries around the world as previously agreed.”</p>
<p>As of the time of disclosure, nothing is known about the unregistered Awakened. In response, the World Awakened Association established an organization to grasp the status of unregistered Awakened. They also emphasized that the task will be done under the cooperation between the association and the UN member states.</p>
<p>The following list is the status of the registered Awakened.</p>
<p>[1] Odin ― Section: Ender / Level: 600 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[2] Mary ― Section: Challenger / Level: 559 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[3] Osiris (Joshua von Karjan) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 533 / Nationality: Germany</p>
<p>[4] King of Hell (Jonathan Hunter) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 530 / Nationality: USA</p>
<p>[5] Caliber (Kwon Seong-Il) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 501 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[6] Hera (Deborah Belluci) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 499 / Nationality: France</p>
<p>[7] Chiron (William Spencer) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 499 / Nationality: UK</p>
<p>[8] Warrior of Sword (Lee Tae-Han) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 485 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[9] Hades (Balter Schneider) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 482 / Nationality: Germany</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[182328] Tiger (Jamal Khan) ― Section: Bronze / Level: 75 / Nationality: India</p>
<p>[182329] Katana (Murai Aita) ― Section: Bronze/ Level: 62 / Nationality: Japan 」</p>
<p>Soward felt compelled to read through the data, even during such an urgent moment, because of her curiosity about Blood. She couldn’t help but speculate about his ranking among the Awakened, given how rapidly he had risen to power in the world of gangs with his formidable superpower</p>
<p>She was confident that he would be one of the strongest Awakened due to his aggressive moves that made gangsters in the area panic. However, she was bewildered by the results.</p>
<p>“Just… gold?”</p>
<p>The world was shocked by the information about Odin.</p>
<p>[Breaking News: ‘Ender,’ a section higher than Challenger, exists. The one and only Ender, Odin.]</p>
<p>[Breaking News: Odin is Korean. Cassandra’s statement “Korea is the sanctuary of Awakened” turns out to be true.]</p>
<p>However, it was more shocking for Soward that Blood was only in the gold section.</p>
<p>‘Considering that a Gold Awakened has already established dominance over the streets of California, how much more powerful will Ender be?’</p>
<p>Only then did she realize why the Awakened freaked out whenever Odin was mentioned.</p>
<p>‘A man of such power is the same human as us…’</p>
<p>She also couldn’t understand why he was staying so quiet.</p>
<p>For now, there were two things she had to do. Rather than looking up at the unknown area that she couldn’t even reach, she had to solve the issues in front of her. One was to capture the criminals who had succeeded in hacking the association’s server, and the other was to stop the distribution of drugs that were evolving day by day.</p>
<p>When Soward was about to start the car, a creepy sound chilled her spine. Two red eyes in the darkness were staring at the back of her head from the backseat.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that I’m just in the gold section.”</p>
<p>“Blood…”</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>It was unclear to Soward how and from where Blood’s fist had struck her. His punch was quick and vicious, resembling a venomous snake attacking its prey as it slammed into her cheek. Despite the excruciating pain and the sensation of her skin tearing, Soward managed to stifle the scream that threatened to escape and didn’t look back.</p>
<p>“There is no need to shiver. I brought good news, so you should be happy about it.”</p>
<p>There was a red pill placed on Blood’s hand as he stretched his arm toward her.</p>
<p>“This is a finished product. You were the first one who crossed my mind. You have been looking for this, right? Why don’t you try it? Come on.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 352</p>
<p>“Yo yo yo, what’s up guys? Welcome back to my channel, and I got something special lined up for y’all today! We are about to post a video of me linking up with the one and only Caliber Kwon Seong-Il. This dude might look like your average Joe on the streets, but in the Stage of Advent, he is a straight-up powerhouse. And get this, homebody has been strolling around in his undies since he got back from the association, haha! So without further ado, let’s get up close and personal with this super-strong Awakened and see what he is all about!”</p>
<p>The clip started with the cameraman going into the living room from a room. It was a prank on Kwon Seong-Il. The in-suite corridor of the Presidential Royal Suite of the Ilsung Hotel was long. At the end where the main living room was connected, Seong-Il’s back appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>With Seong-Il’s muscular back as the backdrop, Ki-Cheol gave a thumbs-up. The editing was amateurish and awkward, with the image of the Hulk poorly superimposed, clearly showing the work of a middle school student. Nevertheless, Ki-Cheol’s videos always became the most-viewed clips as soon as he posted them.</p>
<p>In the video, there were no empty alcohol bottles rolling around in Seong-Il’s room. He seemed to be regaining his senses, waiting for the day when he would enter the extraterrestrial world.</p>
<p>At an angled extension of his arms, every time he made a fist, the resultant force flowed into his back muscles, then continued to propagate upwards, specifically targeting the trapezius muscles and those in close proximity to his spine. The muscles in his entire body reacted as soon as he applied strength to his fist.</p>
<p>Previously, those muscles were buried under a thick layer of fat as there was no point in being fit in a world filled with peace, but they were large and defined. Ki-Cheol seemed to have lost his words since this was his first time seeing his dad like this.</p>
<p>「 (I was so close to going out of my mind. Isn’t his back so sexy?) 」</p>
<p>“Aren’t they cute?” Yeon-Hee said when she saw the sloppily edited words pop up on the video. The clip continued to play.</p>
<p>“You are filming again? You must be having lots of fun.” Seong-Il smiled at the camera.</p>
<p>“Mr. Caliber. Are you working out right now?” Ki-Cheol asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il rolled his eyes. “Hey, why are you calling me that? Just call me dad.”</p>
<p>“Please explain to the subscribers. You don’t seem to be working out.”</p>
<p>“Huh, subscribers?” Seong-Il blinked.</p>
<p>“Yes, the ones who are watching my videos. They are also your fans.”</p>
<p>“So they are like Krong?”</p>
<p>“Krong?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il explained, “I had something called Kronos’s chest plate. It was the first A-class item I got, and it was frighteningly good. It's too bad that I can’t show you and Yong-Joo now because it got destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s something like that. I named them Swordies. Do you want to say hi to them?”</p>
<p>“Gosh, you are making me do everything. Hello, S…swordies~ Is this how you say hi?”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol interjected, “You should wave your hands, too.”</p>
<p>“Oh, um…”</p>
<p>「 (Mr. Caliber is shy. He is adorable!) 」</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, oh my gosh. Look at them. They are calling Seong-Il cute.”</p>
<p>In fact, it was Yeon-Hee who showed me this video with her phone. She was exaggerating her laugh more than usual because she hoped her brightness would calm my anger.</p>
<p>Looking back, there was no setback in the preparation process of the association. I spared no financial resources to the system security team. I put together a team that consisted not only of the country’s top award-winning hackers, but also individuals who had previously worked in Silicon Valley and the U.S. Defense Department. In addition, we also welcomed groups of white hackers from India and China to join our team.</p>
<p>However, the end result was bad. Jamie, who had carried out all the work, wouldn’t have expected such results from them as she offered more than basic salaries and membership in the association. We had planned to provide the data that was leaked to the newly formed market, including the list of the Awakened’s code names and levels.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that the identity of Awakened was disclosed by another group was bound to be a blow. It would appear that there were weaknesses in the Awakened association, and me, Odin. That was why I was pissed.</p>
<p>The power that the Awakened had gained didn’t include that of the IT world that human civilization had created independently. It was the domain of some computer geniuses.</p>
<p>At that time, Jamie called me. Yeon-Hee paused the video that she was watching and waited for me to answer the call.</p>
<p>&lt;Jamie: The hackers have been caught. Eight different groups were cooperating and…&gt;</p>
<p>This was Jamie’s first time getting scolded by me since I hired her. Like Yeon-Hee’s tone, which was higher than usual, there was a change in Jamie’s voice as well. I interrupted her coldly.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: The association is looking for a nice prison, so wait and send them there once you get the info.&gt;</p>
<p>She hesitated to answer that she would follow my order. For Jamie, who didn’t know much about the world of hackers, it could seem reasonable to scout criminals.</p>
<p>However, that kind of thinking was wrong. The skill set possessed by the hackers on our IT team was no less impressive than that of the association’s physical security team. In fact, had the roles been reversed and the black hackers been in charge of security, there was doubt that our IT team would have been capable of infiltrating and extracting even more data given the remarkable experience of each member.</p>
<p>The key takeaway here was that any firewall currently in existence could be breached as long as the hacker’s organization had LAN line access to a computer that was connected to the world’s internet. The U.S. Department of Defense and CIA servers were often treated as trophies for black hackers.</p>
<p>However, there was an obvious reason why black hackers seldom targeted national intelligence facilities, even assuming that they weren’t foreign intelligence agents. This was because the penalties for getting caught were much more severe. It was a whole different story from robbing private companies and threatening them with the data.</p>
<p>Therefore, the association would reveal a more extreme punishment. The vulnerability of the association’s firewall could be supplemented through Bug Bounty’s Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP). Anyway, those who attacked our servers would be sentenced to life imprisonment. A life sentence without parole!</p>
<p>Black hackers around the world would realize a lot from watching these people getting old and dying in prison.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Jamie.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jamie: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: You don’t need to look over the work related to the association anymore. Focus on the current work as soon as you find a successor and hand over.&gt;</p>
<p>Jamie had too much work to do.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Is the trading system on hold?” Yeon-Hee asked in a very disappointed tone.</p>
<p>She had been waiting for the day to trade insignias as she planned to reinforce the Clown’s Dagger.</p>
<p>I explained, “Until the successor takes over the association.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “I think this is a better outcome. If we had already launched the trading system, it would have been much more challenging to resolve the situation, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>I replied while shaking my head, “Take the Light Pillar in Act Two, Stage One as an example. Black hackers succeeded in breaking through the boundaries on the first floor, but they were wiped out on the next floor. For a hacker, nothing is more important than not getting caught. Breaking through the firewalls is just the first step. Hacking is meaningless if you are caught, but they failed to hide from us.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee asked, “Can I say that the association’s security team won? I’m just curious.”</p>
<p>I clarified, “No one actually won.”</p>
<p>“But what if we have to come to a conclusion?”</p>
<p>“The system’s security team won, but it was a pyrrhic victory.”</p>
<p>“Because we caught the hackers?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What about you? You accessed the system of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues before.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, it was a system of rank-and-file officers under them.”</p>
<p>It was a time when no system was connected to the Internet. It was imperative to infiltrate the home base to gain access. To connect the USB, armed with the hacking tools, to the server, I had to navigate through a series of security devices that were as complex and forbidding as a labyrinthine dungeon.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know the hackers you worked with at the time? Why don’t you look for them? Is it hard to find them?”</p>
<p>“If those people are in the diamond section, then the association’s security team members are in the challenger section. They are the best in the world.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked at me with a puzzled look as if she was saying, ‘But they couldn’t defend the server.’</p>
<p>“They can hack the U.S. Department of Defense if they want to. So, our job is to make them not think about even doing that.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee tilted her head to the side. “This field is quite interesting.”</p>
<p>“Every field is like that. Whether it’s big or small, there are rules and disputes. You should know that because you used to be a teacher for a while.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “That’s a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t pretend you know nothing. You were Bronze in the teaching world.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smirked. “You grew up a lot, Seon-Hu. I didn’t expect you to say such mean things, hehe. Do you want to get scolded by me?”</p>
<p>“Save your energy for the night. We won’t sleep at the hotel today.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled and shifted her gaze back to her phone where Ki-Cheol’s video was. When I nodded, she resumed the video and Seong-Il started moving again.</p>
<p>“What did you just do, Mr. Caliber? It was dope!” Ki-Cheol exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Haha, was it?’’</p>
<p>Seong-Il smiled happily at Ki-Cheol in the video.</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Uh… Ummm… I was controlling my Strength. But… Did you get permission to film this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Mr. Caliber would have been usually drinking around this time, but he was controlling his Strength today. I think he is about to enter the fantasy world.”</p>
<p>“Wow, my son should be a news reader. You are so good at speaking, son. Yes, I should go beat them all up. They should know their place and never attack us again. Don’t you think so, Ki-Cheol?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. We are going to film an experiment video today. If you show us the power of the Invincible Caliber, it would be a great opportunity to…”</p>
<p>In the video, Seong-Il and Ki-Cheol engaged in a lengthy exchange of words, which was then edited to play at several times the original speed. Even Yong-Joo joined them, then rubbed his hands together multiple times. Similar scenes quickly passed by after Seong-Il scratched his nose several times.</p>
<p>Then, the screen was switched to darkness with no sound.</p>
<p>「 (It was so hard to get permission ^^ Thank you again to Mr. Caliber and the World Awakened Association for allowing us to film. Please subscribe and like the video!) 」</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol’s exhausted face overlapped the message, then the video started again with Ki-Cheol and Seong-Il standing side by side. They were outside with the twelve-story residence building located behind the Ilsung Hotel in the back.</p>
<p>The interesting thing was that a five-ton refrigerated truck for transporting food ingredients from the Ilsung Hotel was lightly placed on Seong-Il’s right hand. Ki-Cheol and Seong-Il were covered in the shadow below it.</p>
<p>We fast-forwarded through the video and paused at the moment when it zoomed in on the marks left on the cement floor. As we continued to advance the footage, we saw Seong-Il leaping toward the roof of a towering twelve-story building.</p>
<p>「 (This time, I will ask Mr. Caliber to carry me and jump up to the highest floor of the building.) 」</p>
<p>As Ki-Cheol held the camera, the video aptly captured the exhilarating sense of speed that was palpable at that moment.</p>
<p>「 (I thought I was going to die ㅠㅠ) 」</p>
<p>“Seong-Il must love his son a lot. He is doing everything that his son asked for.”</p>
<p>Just as Yeon-Hee was staring at me with a pensive expression, I received a notification indicating that the vehicle I had requested was now available.</p>
<p>[Please select the dungeon that will go through transition.]</p>
<p>Of course, I could have made the necessary adjustments on the spot with my Sixth Sense, but I had a specific reason for wanting to drive there myself and select the dungeon personally. My intention was to be the first to infiltrate the civilization of the Star Dragorin and confront any potential adversaries head-on. I wished to evaluate their strength and assess the situation with my own eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 353</p>
<p>Mr. Caliber Kwon Seong-Il has finally returned from the association’s headquarters. You must have been waiting for a while, Swordies! We worked really hard to prepare for this clip to pay you back for waiting patiently for us. We have many more videos coming up soon, so please continue to support us!</p>
<p>└ [BEST] Time. D: It was so cheesy that they named themselves after Gods at first, but I got goosebumps after watching your video. They’re a different type of human compared to us. Considering that Mr. Caliber only showed us a tiny fraction of his power, it makes a hundred percent sense to call those in the challenger section gods. If he showed something beyond this, then it would have made us afraid of them. Honestly, this alone…</p>
<p>└ Adremarek: This is insane.</p>
<p>└ Shaun: Apart from his ability, I was touched by his love for his son. You must have nothing to fear, Young Master. I’ll continue to support you.</p>
<p>└ Lazybud: Oh my gosh, his back &lt;3 I’d bet ninety percent of his body is made up of muscles. Is that actually the back of a human? Even computer graphics wouldn’t be able to draw such a back. It’s freaking crazy.</p>
<p>└ Kang Seung-Yong: The elves and dwarves are so done now. They will chicken out as soon as they see him. The beast warrior is coming, so get out of the way!</p>
<p>└ Shinkong: [Link: The World Awakened Association: The Awakened Around the World] By the way, Mr. Caliber is ranked fifth in the world.</p>
<p>└ Grape Captain: The first, second, fifth, and eighth are all Koreans. I love it!!</p>
<p>└ New Brand: Odin, who holds the highest authority among the Awakened in the association, holds the 0th rank. The one below him is Lee Tae-Han. What else do we need to say? We gotta take shots for them!</p>
<p>└ Wooden Meat: [Link: Why I’m looking forward to the future of Korea] The Young Master would have known that Odin and Mary were Korean Awakened from this video. How about asking Mary to be your special guest for the following clip? The name sounds like she is a female.</p>
<p>└ Toma: Code name and gender may not match.</p>
<p>└ Time. D: It was cheesy that they named themselves after Gods at first, but I got goosebumps after watching your video. They’re a different type of human compared to us. Considering that Mr. Caliber only showed us a tiny fraction of his power, it makes a hundred percent sense to call those in the challenger section gods. If he showed something beyond this, then it would have made us afraid of them. Honestly, this alone shows… gosh, you are the best, Mr. Caliber![1]</p>
<p>└ Lionessia: For someone ranked fifth, this is nothing. He must be able to burst an entire Graf with one punch. Showing his power to the public was such a good idea. Good job, Young Master.</p>
<p>└ Min-Seob: Nothing? Why do Koreans always belittle others? I want you to keep in mind that that is his minimum power output.</p>
<p>└ Lionessia: No, I didn’t mean that. Don’t pick fights with me.</p>
<p>└ Bioren: Don’t stop me y’all. MARRY ME, MR. CALIBER!! Or you, Young Master!</p>
<p>└ Elf Geek: When can we buy an elf slave? +_+ I’ll only live for that day. (31 years old, male, office worker, Seoul)</p>
<p>└ Clear Sky: In the future, no content will surpass Invincible Caliber TV in terms of quality or excellence.</p>
<p>└ Kim Tidy: Do you not know of Catalina Ronea?</p>
<p>└ Clear Sky: She is just in the gold section.</p>
<p>└ Star of the Flavor: I was thrilled as a Korean. It’s impossible for me to contain my excitement knowing that the Awakened known as the savior is among them, Mary, who is ranked second, Lee Tae-Han, the President of the World Awakened Association, and Kwon Seong-Il, who holds the fifth rank and reminds me of our parents with his love for his kid, are all Korean. This country has been eaten up by Jeonil, but there is hope. [Link: Shocking truth about Jeonil Group.] Please watch this.</p>
<p>└ Star of the Flavor: I feel sorry for that truck more than the elf. It has become a toy!</p>
<p>└ DDK: I can’t shut my mouth. I was expecting it, but this is amazing. I thought I was watching a movie. That’s why I feel worse about the clumsy editing skills. I’m sorry, but that’s true.</p>
<p>└ I’m Sick: …This is pathetic. We are so pathetic! We have reached a point where we are not alarmed by the video’s implications, but rather derive pleasure from it. What do you think is the point of the association showing the power of the Awakened in the challenger section? This is why the media is dangerous.</p>
<p>└ Rockhead: Yeah, [Link: Agreement between the World Awakened Association and the UN member states on membership]. Their attack has already begun quietly. Bullets don’t work. They are even superhumans. Caliber will be able to subdue this country’s military alone. But Odin? He is in the Ender section. Moreover, the association is as clever as it’s quiet. They know how to attack and control us. I’m afraid of that, you jerks. You, morons, should feel the same way, okay?</p>
<p>└ Mr. Happiness: Alright, bring on the next idiot! If we take into account the association’s impact and the Awakened’s authority, their power in Korea is immense. You are being way too negative and not considering the advantage we could gain from them. Tsk tsk.</p>
<p>└ Lunatic: Caliber looks like my dad, but my dad is not an Awakened :’( His body is covered in fat and he has no skills. Only his stomach is protruding lol. He also sleeps a lot.</p>
<p>└ Sunshine: Every father is like an Awakened to their kids. Let’s be nice to our parents while they are here.」</p>
<p>Yes, of course. This guy knows something. So instead of staring at your phone, why don’t you give your parents a shoulder massage.</p>
<p>Seong-Il scrolled through all the comments, feeling uneasy about his face being shown, but he still enjoyed Ki-Cheol’s happiness. Moreover, Ki-Cheol informed him that it was a prevalent trend among today’s youth.</p>
<p>In fact, even those who had grown to become leaders of a group during the Stage of Advent often engaged in taking interviews or showing up on social media as an influencer’s guests.</p>
<p>They were labeled as elites, and they faced tougher challenges than others to earn that status before the Stage of Advent. Whether it was academics, career, politics, or sports, they all shared something in common. They had learned how to battle the world before entering the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Life in every world was tough. Seong-Il was worried that Ki-Cheol might fall victim to scams if they promised money or buildings. He wanted Ki-Cheol to understand the dangers associated with money.</p>
<p>His grades didn’t matter because Seong-Il thought what made school meaningful was the opportunity to learn how to interact with people. Even if Ki-Cheol had devoted himself entirely to his studies, he wouldn’t have learned how to navigate the world unless he was among the top two-ranked students in school and was able to join an elite group as a result.</p>
<p>However, that was just one of many roads Ki-Cheol could choose to take. By staying focused on a single path and having a genuine interest and passion for it, he could enter the circle and acquire a wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Competition existed in every world as it was a natural part of life. People strove to outdo their rivals and achieve greater success. When monetary incentives weren’t present, reputation became a driving factor. Even if you fell behind in the competition, the lessons learned could provide motivation for future goals.</p>
<p>Seong-Il dreamed that Ki-Cheol would grow mature through such competition. He was still a child, but he said creators work and succeed regardless of age. It was a good experience for Ki-Cheol.</p>
<p>He muttered, “But the video editing actually sucks. I should get him a tutor.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il wasn’t familiar with creating videos, but the clips that Ki-Cheol and Yong-Joo were making were quite amateur. He smiled with satisfaction at the thought of the two kids working together to film the video, even at this late hour. He felt proud seeing them striving to become experts, using obscure terminology and staring at their monitors with solemn expressions.</p>
<p>Making money, meeting other officials who could be their colleagues or rivals, seeking help from successful experts in the field, fighting over differences in opinions between friends, and getting a sense of accomplishment were the process of becoming a real adult. Not a fake adult like he was in the past.</p>
<p>In that sense, Seong-Il had to lift the restrictions that were tied to Ki-Cheol.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't he reap the benefits of his father’s fame?</p>
<p>That was what the world was like.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: I can’t say much because I know nothing about this computer thing, but cheer up. You are the female president of the Jeonil Group. Odin is merciless to traitors, but he doesn’t throw personnel away because of just one mistake. Oh, by the way, I want to talk about Ki-Cheol…&gt;</p>
<p>Seong-Il and Jamie’s phone conversation continued until he arrived at the meeting location.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The destination that was set for Seong-Il’s navigation system was a hill in Incheon.</p>
<p>「 Warning!</p>

<p>February 1st, 1998</p>
<p>Jeonil Investment (Co., Ltd.) 」</p>
<p>The notification board was attached to the barbed wire. Exactly twenty years had passed since it was first put up, so traces of time remained on it as it had become rusty.</p>
<p>Those who arrived before Seong-Il were camped there. Five black vans were parked side by side, and when Seong-Il got out of the car, a total of twenty-five people, five people per car, also got out of the cars at once. They were all wearing association security uniforms and were unarmed at the moment.</p>
<p>Seong-Il laughed while looking around at the foreign agents. The first person he spoke to was an Asian who stood out among them.</p>
<p>“Are you Korean?”</p>
<p>The agent saluted. “Yes, sir! My name is Kim Shin-Bae. I’m honored to be here with you today.”</p>
<p>He reminded Seong-Il of the soldier from Act One, Stage One, which was a long time ago.</p>
<p>What was his name?</p>
<p>Seong-Il couldn’t remember, but Kim Shin-Bae’s stiff posture and impression he gave off resembled the soldier in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>“It’s not an honor. Um, do you speak English?”</p>
<p>The agent nodded. “Yes, I have no issue translating.”</p>
<p>“Odin and Mary will arrive soon, so get ready.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. Is there anything else to pass along a request?” Kim Shin-Bae asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il huffed, “You should ask your boss. Do I have to take care of every novice?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sir. I apologize.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il chuckled. “Hehe, I’m just kidding. Don’t be scared. It’s because you just look so fresh.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il had roughly heard that the team had assisted Odin and Mary when they were in the middle of a dungeon. Although they weren’t Awakened, they were competent.</p>
<p>Seong-Il approached the foreign agents first and began to shake hands with them.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Caliber. How do you do?”</p>
<p>“How do you do, sir?”</p>
<p>“Good. Sir!”</p>
<p>“Honored to be here. Sir!”</p>
<p>After shaking hands with everyone, Seong-Il took out the combat backpack he had prepared from the trunk of the car. He packed the same items as he did when he entered dungeons during the Stage of Advent because he wasn’t sure of what to expect in Star Dragorin. Despite the general perception that Star Dragorin was a fantasy land full of hope and dreams, the reality proved to be quite different.</p>
<p>Seong-Il clenched his fist, recalling why mankind was in a safe spot.</p>
<p>Yes, fuck. There is no reason for me to have a headache. Those who stress us out are enemies. I should just trust Odin and go ahead.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shouted at the agents, “Okay, guys. Let’s get ready!”</p>

<p>Chapter 354</p>
<p>“The Blue House National Petition Bulletin Board is abuzz with numerous petitions for land restoration projects in Gwacheon, Anyang, and Gunpo. Around thirty petitions have been filed, with many expressing concerns about the Jeonil Group receiving all the work once again. Despite a rebuttal by Park Yong-Tae, a former member of the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and head of the restoration committee, public opinion remains divided due to various suspicions.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was driving. Seeing that she was smiling, she was likely recalling the time we went around the dungeon together a long time ago.</p>
<p>“Moving on to other news, Lee Tae-Han, the president of the World Awakened Association, has established the Safety Bureau to combat crimes committed by association members and unregistered Awakened, as well as crimes targeting the association. Korean Awakened Sekhmet Kim Ji-Ae has been elected as the director of the Safety Bureau. She was formerly a public official at the Public Security Department of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office and will be overseeing the hacking incident that occurred on the day of registration. As a result, Coril Peterson and thirteen other cybercriminals are expected to be imprisoned in ADX Florence Prison, which was granted to the association by the US government. And without a formal trial…”</p>
<p>As I gazed out the window at the tranquil world before me, I was struck by the realization that the idea of an alien invasion was beginning to feel like a mere myth. The serene world was something that I wished to safeguard and preserve for the future.</p>
<p>Beside us was a van full of people. It looked like they were going on a weekend outing. I watched it pass by and turned down the radio. I contacted my parents whenever I had time, but this was my first time calling them since the registration day.</p>
<p>No matter whom I called, my mother always picked it up. After I talked to her for a few minutes, my father told me to wait for a bit. During that brief period of silence, I had a hunch my father moved to the yard to avoid my mother’s nagging.</p>
<p>&lt;Father: I heard Ji-Ae became the director of the Safety Department. You keep in touch with her, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Are you going to be working there as well?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Nothing has been decided yet. The association system is slowly taking place, and there are many new organizations, so we need to wait and see. In fact, it’s more likely for me to be assigned to a private group instead of the association organization.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: You don’t like the Safety Department? I think it will be limited to domestic and international work. Your mother talks a lot about it these days. As you know, son, as a man, we can’t really say much when our wives nag when we get old. My ears are sore.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: It’s more dangerous to deal with the Awakened, Father. They violate the association’s instructions and commit crimes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: I have explained that to her so many times, but she still believes that monsters are much more dangerous than Awakened.&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks to my father, my mother didn’t badger me into returning to the financial industry. Having seen my natural talent and past successes before the Stage of Advent, she was content to let me pursue my path. She was also mindful of the risks faced by the Awakened and concerned about me.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my father still worried about me.</p>
<p>&lt;Father: What is the private organization?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Agencies are going through the Awakened list right now, and I already received some recruitment suggestions.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: A new market is opening as the new era is beginning. The security and military industries will need many Awakened, yet that is the greatest irony. Other than the war against the extraterrestrial world, isn’t the reason why the Awakened are required in such a market because of other risk factors? Because they need to hire Awakened to stop other Awakened. You must have spent a very long time on the stage, and everyone must be different. I heard that the registration went successfully, so I’m not concerned about that.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Yes, Father.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Did you get any calls from the Ministry of National Defense?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Do you think they will make me serve in the military now?[1]&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Well, you are around the right age to get that notification, haha. Well, it’s nice to hear you laughing. Don’t worry about your mother and do what you have to do. I’m still the head of this family.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: You just said you can’t even talk back to Mother.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Ah, that’s true. Hahaha.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: If you consider the years I spent in the Stage of Advent, then I’m over fifty-five years old, Father.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Alright, I’ll celebrate your sixtieth birthday in five years, so be safe and take care of yourself.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: I’m in the platinum range. Even if I want to harm myself intentionally, it’s hard to do so.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Good for you, son.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: I’ll call you again soon.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Okay, I should go for a drive with your mom.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Okay, have fun.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: …Thank you for everything. Everyone, including your mom and I, is living without worries, thanks to you guys. No matter what people say, that’s the truth. Don’t listen to others.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Father…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Haha, I’m taking up too much of your time, right? You will understand me if you ever have a kid. Even though you are all grown up and have been to the Stage of Advent, you are still a child to us. I hope you don’t take my words as me nagging you.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Of course not.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Go hang out with some girls too.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Okay.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Father: Take care.&gt;</p>
<p>He claimed that he had taken up a lot of my time, but it was less than four minutes. At the same time, the car was turning towards the rest area.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We were thinking of getting some dessert after munching on some udon, ramen, bibimbap[2], some freshly made toast and fish cakes. Then, Yeon-Hee’s phone rang. When she shook her phone as if the message was interesting, I also got the message.</p>
<p>The message appeared to be targeted toward the entire population of Korean Awakened, with the exception of Odin, Mary, and the association leaders. It was transmitted through the association secretariat, indicating that the sender was likely someone within the secretariat.</p>
<p>「 Dear Na Seon-Hu,</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for your dedication and sacrifice in the face of the extraterrestrial challenges we are all facing. These challenges have provided us with valuable lessons and inspiration, and, as a result, our headquarters has strengthened its external capabilities by refocusing our perspective on the outside world and establishing a system based on fundamental principles.</p>
<p>We pledge to continue fostering trust through the use of competitive teams with specialized skills and career paths. Furthermore, we are committed to our mission of connecting Awakened, such as yourself, with meaningful employment opportunities.</p>
<p>First. We will provide high-quality service.</p>
<p>* We promise your family will receive the same service. (We will help you with the details through consultation. We are confident that this service is superior to any offered by other companies.)</p>
<p>Second. We will maintain a consistent connection with the association’s secretariat to ensure swift access to relevant information.</p>
<p>* While lobbyist activities are prohibited in Korea, they can still be accessed through channels outside of the country, such as the United States. Furthermore, there are specific approaches planned for domestic situations in Korea, and the association has not expressly forbidden lobbyist activities.</p>
<p>Third. We will create the best in market (item, insignia) transactions that could be difficult.</p>
<p>* The association is preparing a system to trade items and insignias.</p>
<p>Fourth. We will provide you with employment that is worthy of your competence.</p>
<p>* If you’d like to advance into outer space: we will connect you with other companies to create the best attack squad.</p>
<p>* If you’d like to work in domestic and international jobs: there are many markets around the world that need the help of Awakened. This allows us to bring your value to the highest level.</p>

<p>The executive of Daehyun Group was directly involved in the scouting, but they were too late. Not only had the conglomerate groups like Jeonil and Ilsung already begun, but the foreign firms had also been contacting Awakened since the registration day. To them, Yeon-Hee and I were ‘Woo Yeon-Hee’ and ‘Na Seon-Hu’ instead of Odin and Mary.</p>
<p>We had registered our fake identities to the association, so the total number of registered Awakened in the world was recorded as 182,329, excluding two.</p>
<p>“Daehyun must not be doing this to make money, right? There’s not that many Awakened in Korea.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee made a good point.</p>
<p>“Maybe they really want to make money. All they have is the reputation of a conglomerate.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I want a mocha latte.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee changed the topic as if it wasn’t worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>“Iced Americano.”</p>
<p>“You might crave sweets in the future. Why don’t you have some when you can?” she asked.</p>
<p>“They must have one there since they seem pretty civilized.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An association agent blocked the vehicle on the way to the hill in Incheon. Upon receiving information from a senior agent who recognized both my and Yeon-Hee’s faces, the new Asian agent visibly calmed his nerves, straightened his posture, and respectfully lowered his head.</p>
<p>They were in casual clothes, but the agents who would climb the hill with us were checking their personal armaments in combat uniforms and automatic rifles.</p>
<p>A palpable tension permeated the area due to the possibility of entering the dungeon with Awakened. If access to the Star Dragorin was unobstructed, then there was no reason not to have combat personnel accompany the team.</p>
<p>There were many things to test. First was if human firearms worked in this new world, and if so, to what extent could they hurt the creatures there. As a result, in addition to the automatic firearms they were armed with, the boxes containing the anti-tank rockets were also ready for transport. Combat agents wearing tactical equipment were also ready to enter dangerous areas in the Middle East right away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Seong-Il walked out of the group of nervous agents. He no longer looked old like he did in Ki-Cheol’s video. There was a lot of tension on his face too. The only relaxed one was Yeon-Hee as she waved her hand at him.</p>
<p>Seong-Il briefly lowered his head at me and said, “I feel much more relieved that you are coming with us, noona.”</p>
<p>“Me? I’m not going. Who said I’m coming with you?” Yeon-Hee replied.</p>
<p>He was visibly surprised. “Since you came here, I thought, of course, you would…”</p>
<p>“By the way, didn’t Ki-Cheol say he wanted to tag along? I could feel your love for him from the screen. It was a good video.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his nose. “Ah… You watched it, too. But I don’t have a big mouth. Even if he is my son, I don’t tell him everything as I keep my private life and public life separate. Also, outer space is… ugh. When he talked about elves and dwarves, I wanted to scold him so much…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il slurred the end of his sentence while shifting his gaze over our shoulders.</p>
<p>“Osiris? No, he is not coming, and there is a chance that you might not enter.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Seong-Il widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Odin will enter first and grasp the situation. You will be on guard just in case things happen. Why? Why do you look so disappointed? Do you want me to stand guard with you?”</p>
<p>He rubbed the back of his head. “No, it’s not that. I heard dwarves are good at making jewelry.”</p>
<p>“I hope their world is just as what the civilians are all making a fuss about. Hm, if you happen to get their jewelry, what are you going to do? Do you have someone you want to give it to, Seong-Il?”</p>
<p>He shook his head vigorously. “Cough. No, it’s just because I have someone to thank.”</p>
<p>“Jamie? She is pretty for her age. Okay, let’s work.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee teased, “How long are you going to joke around with me? You’re more relaxed now, right?”</p>
<p>He pouted. “Hey, I’m not a novice or a coward. This is embarrassing. These people seem to understand a bit of Korean.”</p>
<p>“It would have been better to just manipulate your mind, right?” Yeon-Hee said slyly.</p>
<p>“Haha, no. You are so good at saying scary things with a smile.”</p>
<p>The senior agent was waiting to speak to Yeon-Hee. However, after the conversation with Seong-Il, the leader-like agent feigned familiarity with her. This immediately soured Yeon-Hee’s mood, causing her smile to disappear and her demeanor to turn cold and distant.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee ignored the agent and told the others to carry out their duties appropriately. Then, she waved at me and gave me a worried look.</p>
<p>- I’ll be waiting for you, Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>Right after that I climbed the hill in search of the entrance to the dungeon. Upon reaching the entrance, the agents remained unfazed as the ground vibrated when the dungeon was unsealed. They had become accustomed to such occurrences.</p>
<p>Bzzzz-</p>
<p>They waited calmly for the moment when the stairs or burrows under the blue curtain became visible. However, they started exchanging puzzled gazes with each other when nothing occurred even after the vibration.</p>
<p>This was predictable as all roads leading to the Seven Demon Kings Corps had been sealed off upon the completion of the ritual. However, a new path could be forged, and only I, as Doom Man, possessed the power to do so.</p>
<p>The mere thought of it triggered electrical impulses in my mind as I recalled the moment when the dark power within my Life Vessel was revealed at my fingertips. Dark haze emanated from each of my fingertips, coalescing into black wisps that traveled up my arms from my wrists to my shoulders.</p>
<p>Srrrr-</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s and the agents’ attention were completely focused on me. While everyone’s eyes were shaking, the way to enter the Star Dragorin unfolded in front of us.</p>
<p>[You have transformed one of the old dungeons.]</p>

<p>Chapter 355</p>
<p>Franklin Dukedom, Greenwood Continent.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord!</p>
<p>Elland trembled as if he had a spasm when he finished appraising the relics. Therefore, his subordinates, who mistook this as a curse, immediately prepared themselves for a battle.</p>
<p>The curse of the evil spirit Doom Kaos sometimes appeared in ancient ruins, and they were dreadful. Also, the prospect of hiring a skilled sorcerer capable of confronting the curse seemed like nothing more than a mere dream. If Elland took a longer time to come to his senses, his squad members would have attacked him, thinking he was possessed by Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>“It’s all good! Let’s go back!”</p>
<p>Elland’s voice brimmed with such immense joy that it caused a flutter in everyone’s heart. While he desired to uplift and motivate each of his subordinates, the task at hand was far from complete.</p>
<p>What was the point of finding a treasure? As many historical expedition teams had done, if they failed to exit the area, then he and his men would become skeletons and be buried under the ground. Of course, the treasure wouldn’t be able to see the light of the sun either.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elland’s men were experienced as they knew what to do next. Though they were steeped in happiness, it didn’t take long for them to be jolted back to reality. By retracing the deliberate marks they had left, they managed to make a successful escape from the ruins. A lookout group had been in the surrounding area and soon Elland’s group doubled in size.</p>
<p>They arrived at the campsite that night, and it was situated precariously close to the domain of the Red-Faced Orc. That was why Elland designated this path as a returning route. The risk was high, but the Red-Faced Orc and the Franklin Dukedom had signed an agreement. If monsters like the Declans appeared, then they could ask the Orc for help. In other words, they could be a great shield if they didn’t figure out that Elland’s squad had found a treasure.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was the most unfavorable outcome. Spending the night without any incidents and returning home safely would be the best possible scenario.</p>
<p>When everyone was busy preparing for the night, Elland’s assistant approached Elland. He was quite curious about what the treasure was.</p>
<p>“They seem to be ancient documents?”</p>
<p>The assistant didn’t hide the fact that he had seen something.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Upon Elland’s answer, disappointment flashed on the assistant’s face and vanished.</p>
<p>His name was Malus. He was an ordinary traveler who primarily scoured for weapons infused with the divinity of Lacryma. Due to his expertise, Elland recruited him as his assistant with a single caveat - Malus would have to work as part of the expedition team and surrender any of Lacryma’s sacred armor that he discovered.</p>
<p>However, that scenario would be quite rare, so the contract was mutually beneficial for both of them. It was a common agreement among the experienced expenditure parties like Elland’s.</p>
<p>“What kind of documents were they?”</p>
<p>Elland hoped Malus would extend the contract for the next expedition, so he replied honestly, “For now… It is believed to be the Archives of Saint Cassian. It might be true.”</p>
<p>They both became speechless for a moment. Not just two of them, but everyone knew how precious Saint Cassian’s records were. The Red-Faced Orcs were not exempt from this notion, which could possibly explain their migration across the sea and into the Dukedom’s borders. No matter how much Elland pondered over it, that seemed to be the sole rationale behind their arrival, purporting to act as the Dukedom’s shields.</p>
<p>“I envy you for that. You are going to grab fame and money at the same time,” Malus said.</p>
<p>“When have I never? Please stay with me. The next destination is scheduled upon our return.”</p>
<p>“The God Lacryma doesn’t stretch out a hand to the same person more than once. I will only be with you for this expedition. You better stop exploring for the time being, Elland. Well, if you succeed in returning home.”</p>
<p>The weight on Malus’s back seemed burdensome as he turned away. He had fought against the Declan several times by risking his life. By doing that, he finally retrieved the ancient relics, but he still couldn’t find the object he had been looking for.</p>
<p>Elland understood how Malus was feeling.</p>
<p>Should I share some of the money that I obtain from selling the treasure? Or would it be better to present him with the Blessing of the Altar?</p>
<p>He shook his head, as this wasn’t his first experience working with someone like Malus who was not bound to stay. However, Elland considered himself lucky that, unlike some of his previous assistants, Malus hadn’t violated their agreement by attempting to pilfer the treasure.</p>
<p>Well, at least he hadn’t yet. Elland sent a signal to his squad to keep an eye on Malus.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The night was still, and only the guards remained awake. Bonfires were scarce in the area where Declans could appear. Despite the relentless chill, the sentries struggled to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of the sentries’ eyes widened in alarm. Right then Malus bolted out of the tent as he had sensed an ominous presence. His eyes glinted with a crimson aura as he gazed ahead. Then, the looming figures concealed in the shadows revealed themselves.</p>
<p>They were not Declan warriors, as they were larger in size and lacked dog-like snouts. Instead, their protruding molars were hideously shining under the moonlight. The orcs that emerged with traces of Declan blood on their faces appeared formidable.</p>
<p>Malus noticed a red aura in their eyes that was akin to his own.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Malus signaled to the sentries to wake Elland up, then he walked toward the orc chief. It wasn’t his first time seeing them, but he couldn’t help but be overwhelmed by their intimidating presence.</p>
<p>There were fifteen orcs, including their leader. Considering that the leader of the orcs was protected by their Lord, they had to brace themselves for extermination if they harbored any murderous intent.</p>
<p>“What are the Lord’s warriors doing here?”</p>
<p>The head of the orcs loosened its grip on the ax.</p>
<p>“You have met us before,” the orc answered.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have met the warriors of the Steel Molar Clan.”</p>
<p>“You met trash.”</p>
<p>The orc’s voice contained hostility.</p>
<p>Oh, are they rivals? Damn it. When will Elland show up?</p>
<p>As Malus stood in stunned silence and checked his back, Elland was, fortunately, hurrying towards him. “I’m sorry. I’m the leader of these people. You may speak to me, warriors.”</p>
<p>Malus honestly admired Ellard’s polite attitude.</p>
<p>He stepped back while skimming through each orc. It seemed like they had recently engaged in a fierce battle with the Declans, as the bloodstains on their faces hadn’t yet congealed. Furthermore, scraps of freshly skinned Declan leather protruded from the bags they carried. Each orc had pouches, presumably containing mana stones, with blood oozing out from there.</p>
<p>Aren’t they after us? I hope I escape from this situation somehow.</p>
<p>After calculating the possible scenarios, Elland generously offered a high-level healing potion. As long as he could safely return home with the treasure, the potion was nothing.</p>
<p>The orc raised its voice, “Do we look like we are here to rob you?”</p>
<p>The orc’s haughty arrogance threatened to ruin the precious healing potion. In fact, the orc was fixated on Elland’s hand, which held the potion, prompting Elland to speak with a sense of urgency, just as the orc was about to toss it away.</p>
<p>“The guy who was protected under the sacred God created this. Please use this on your warriors for us. Please accept it.”</p>
<p>“How dare you feeble humans invade our domain!” the orc snarled.</p>
<p>He sputtered, “We heard that there was an agreement with the Dukedome and you guys, so…”</p>
<p>The orc interrupted, “It was a messy agreement, and it’s not for you guys.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. We will leave as soon as dawn comes.”</p>
<p>The orc looked at the healing potion, then took a pouch off his waistline. It was filled with mana stones. Since the orc's fist was huge, the pouch he was holding looked relatively tiny. The same was true of the bottle with the healing potion, so it looked very small when the orc took it from Elland’s hand.</p>
<p>When the orcs completely disappeared into the darkness, Elland realized that he had no strength left in his body. His back had been soaked with cold sweat ever since the orc had handed him the pouch full of mana stones.</p>
<p>On his way back to the tent, he called Malus.</p>
<p>“They… seemed to have noticed.”</p>
<p>As Elland spoke, his voice quavered with fear. His formerly respectful demeanor towards the orc crumbled as soon as he stepped into the tent.</p>
<p>“Then, they would have attacked us earlier.”</p>
<p>“In general, yes. However, they are a Red-Faced Clan. You seem to have forgotten, but they are ferocious and clever.”</p>
<p>Elland put down the mana stone pouch that was given to him by the orc chief helplessly. Then, he added while staring at the pouch, “He left this… not to worry about them. But, they will come back soon.”</p>
<p>“As long as we hide the treasure, it will be fine. We should do that right now…” Malus suggested.</p>
<p>“No, they will check the traces from the historic site. They will find out that we have entered there.”</p>
<p>“They should have protected it well in the beginning!” Malus raised his voice.</p>
<p>“They have so many historic sites. Please take my opinion with a grain of salt. It is probable that the Red-Faced Orcs had already become aware that the relics of Saint Cassian were located there. This realization likely led them to seek agreement rather than resorting to war.”</p>
<p>“So they volunteered to be the shield.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. From the Duchy’s standpoint, there was no reason to reject the Red-Faced Clan’s offer to provide assistance.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you knew that Saint Cassian’s remains were left at the site?”</p>
<p>“No way. It seems that the Lord has bestowed a fortune upon us.”</p>
<p>“As I have told you already, the Lord won’t give you more than one fortune.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m telling you. You are a person from the duchy, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but…”</p>
<p>“Then, how much do you love the Dukedom?” Elland asked.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“If the Red-Faced Clan gains possession of the treasure, they will retreat back to their continent without shedding blood needlessly. Then, the Duchy may be plunged into chaos again. I must apologize for telling you this, but the Duchy’s might is incapable of suppressing the Declans. On a day when the Declan Priest appears…”</p>
<p>Malus interrupted impatiently, “What are you talking about? Let’s just get to the bottom line.”</p>
<p>“The good thing is that we are in the border area of the clan. The number of Orcs rushing toward us won’t be very high.”</p>
<p>“Don’t beat around the bush and get to the point,” Malus snapped.</p>
<p>“Our contract is sacred in the name of God Lacryma. I hope you don’t violate it.”</p>
<p>Malus frowned immediately. “What the hell do you think I am? I said I would stay next to you rather we return or die. It’s cruel that you even mention the Lord.”</p>
<p>Elland grimaced. “As you know, I have been through so many assistants.”</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>“In the face of a desperate crisis, you don’t seem to acknowledge the brilliance of the Lord Lacryma. It’s time for us all to think about the reason why the Lord gives us this ordeal.”</p>
<p>“You should have been a priest.”</p>
<p>Malus rose from his seat with an unpleasant look. Then, he added, “I will let it slide this time, but if you try to intimidate me in God’s name again, I won’t forgive you.”</p>
<p>“Then, please be prepared for God Lacryma’s divine protection.”</p>
<p>“...The God Lacryma’s divine protection.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Orcs born with combat capabilities were also good at ambushing. Thus it made more sense to prepare for a battle at their current spot rather than leaving the campsite and wandering around at night. It was a blessing if all their preparations just ended up being for nothing.</p>
<p>The worst outcome entailed the Declans being drawn to the battle by the scent of blood. Elland couldn’t shake off his assumptions, and the eerie silence only exacerbated his dread. He, Malus, and the other adventurers bided their time in the darkness, awaiting the opportune moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It wasn’t particularly tall, but it had a broad build. The being strode forward unaccompanied, seemingly having led the group from the front. The two crimson eyes embedded in the darkness were so vivid that they resembled malevolent spirits.</p>
<p>It was Malus who first checked the figure’s identity, and Elland confirmed it next.</p>
<p>“It’s… a human,” Malus opened his eyes as if he wanted to make sure that what he saw was right.</p>
<p>Elland nodded but remained vigilant because of the things he saw after. The muscular man’s massive physique was drenched in green blood, and his face was likewise splattered with the green blood of the orcs. This was similar to how Red-faced Orcs’ faces were covered in Declan's blood.</p>
<p>Then, the guy threw the body that he was dragging toward Elland. Elland and Malus looked at the body that fell in front of them. It was definitely the chief of the orcs that they had just talked to a few hours ago.</p>
<p>Elland finally grasped the situation.</p>
<p>The Lord doesn’t give blessings more than once? That is clearly false.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there was no way to explain their encounter with the hero strong enough to annihilate the orcs!</p>
<p>We are safe!</p>
<p>When Elland got up with a jubilant face…</p>
<p>“Not yet!”</p>
<p>The moment Malus yelled at Elland, a large shadow flew in at a speed that couldn’t be followed by the naked eye. The guy grabbed the top of Elland’s head with his hand and tried crumpling his face.</p>
<p>“SS-bul. Jin jja dook gae ne ing. (Shit. This is so fucked up!)”</p>

<p>Yeon-Hee greeted me with a look of surprise. It appeared that she was ready to leave immediately for the accommodation, considering the car had been started already. When I closed the door after sitting in the passenger seat, she lowered the radio volume.</p>
<p>“I thought you went in there.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I sent Kwon Seong-Il.”</p>
<p>“Why?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I was blocked. My corps must secure my way in.”</p>
<p>Yes, I got this message when I tried to enter Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>[Your entry is being blocked by the power of the Old one. * Including the Gate]</p>
<p>[A command has arrived from your master, Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>[Secure the Access Road (Command)</p>
<p>The Old One has complete control over Star Dragorin, having created this battlefield by channeling its power. It’s where the Old One will make its final stand with fierce resistance.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, your master, the all-powerful Doom Kaos, has already achieved multiple victories. To prove your worth to your master, you must demonstrate satisfactory results, starting by infiltrating Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>* Occupy the Greenwood Continent’s ‘Whirlpool Land’ with your corps.</p>
<p>* Also, have your corps remove ‘Holy Knight Caldoran’ or other Holy Knights on earth. The Old One’s power in the Holy Knight will become yours and show you the way to get in.</p>
<p>If you succeed: The number of Old One’s corps attacking your mainland will decrease.</p>
<p>If you fail: The number of Old One’s corps attacking your mainland will increase.</p>
<p>Remaining time: Fifty days.]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee remained silent for a while after hearing the explanation, then said calmly, “The deadline is on June 10th.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When I sent Seong-Il to Dragorin, I gave him specific instructions to return promptly without any delay. However, shortly after his entry, the gate closed, and several minutes passed without any sign of Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Four hours later, he returned. At that time, I was waiting in the car under the hill with Yeon-Hee. Since there was no sign of danger, she also accompanied me.</p>
<p>Seong-Il was standing in a spot, slightly away from the lights that the agents had lit. Some wet towels were stained and dumped around him in a disorganized manner. He poured bottled water on his face and smiled at us as if things were ridiculous.</p>
<p>He had brought back many things, and one of them was an orc’s corpse. There were also two humans, who were barely alive. Seong-Il rose to his feet as the agents seized the humans.</p>
<p>He then gazed at the spot where the dungeon entrance had vanished and said, “I think we can go in and out as we want.”</p>
<p>Then, he handed me a microchronometer[1]. The passage of time in the Land of the Dead was completely different from reality, and the time here was the same. The amount of time that had elapsed on Seong-Il’s microchronometer, was equivalent to the time that had passed here.</p>
<p>“How did you reopen the entrance of the dungeon?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee turned away from the two humans to look at Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Seong-Il responded with a shrug, “I honestly freaked out because I thought I wouldn’t be able to come back. So I beat as many monsters as possible, then the gate reopened.”</p>
<p>I asked, “Who are they?”</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “Ugh, they were so clingy. They rushed into me, risking their lives. If I didn’t get your order to return quickly, then I would have destroyed their nuts.”</p>
<p>We walked toward the humans, and when I gave the agents a look, they took multiple steps back.</p>
<p>Seong-Il commented, “These fuckers use Night Eyes.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t just talking about the two different humans. Seong-Il added that he saw the same thing with the orcs.</p>
<p>He continued with his analysis, “These two were similar in strength to those at the end of the bronze section, while the dead monster was at the silver level. But that one was still considered the top three among the orcs.”</p>
<p>“You should have brought the orc back alive.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his nose after being scolded by Yeon-Hee. “I told you, noona. They are weak and pathetic. I honestly didn’t think it would get crushed that easily. Send me anywhere. I will get you thousands of humans and monsters.”</p>
<p>I rummaged through the items that Seong-Il had brought. Several pouches were entangled with each other and drenched in green and red blood. I could discern that they were filled with mana stones without even opening them as some had spilled out of the pouches.</p>
<p>When I kicked the orc’s body and turned it over so that its abdomen faced the sky, Seong-Il said, “I sliced open some of their stomachs, but none of them had any mana stones. It looks like they had gotten them by hunting and gathering from the Declans. Although they hadn't established the Mana Stone Bank, they had clearly invested effort in accumulating the stones.”</p>
<p>“Declan?” I asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il grinned. “I’m a master in smelling and figuring things out. I could smell them from afar. I tried to kill them all, but I returned as the dungeon entrance opened at that time. I suddenly remembered what you told me.”</p>
<p>“Anything special or abnormal things you noticed?”</p>
<p>He responded, “The air was definitely different as soon as I entered the space. I mean, not just air, but the vibe. I felt something really strong.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We were unable to enter the dungeon freely, and it didn’t lead to a labyrinth like the former dungeons. Instead, it was more like a small gate, a direct passage to Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>When Seong-Il had cleared all the monsters in the vicinity, the gate had opened, hinting at the possibility of a hidden quest, although there was no clear indication of what needed to be done. It was likely that the door would only open once a certain amount of destruction had been wrought.</p>
<p>Of course, we needed to experiment more and come to a conclusion in the future. When I looked at Yeon-Hee, she grasped my intention and moved.</p>
<p>The two people Seong-Il had brought over were Caucasians. One was in his early forties and the other was in his mid-thirties. Among them, Yeon-Hee’s first choice was a guy in his early forties. She sat down in front of him, then Seong-Il said as if he was giving advice, “There is not much of a difference, but the other seemed a bit stronger. The one with the scar under his eyes.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled but remained focused on her target. Her recovery skill emitted a bright white light that enveloped the man, and she finished her work by gently caressing his cheek.</p>
<p>The man struggled to open his eyes and repeatedly blinked as an LED light was shining directly on his face. When he finally looked at Yeon-Hee, her eyes turned black.</p>
<p>At that time, Seong-Il came out after changing his clothes. When I handed him a cigarette, he picked it up with both hands. As he lit his cigarette, he instinctively turned his head to the side, much like one would when drinking with an elder or in a formal setting.</p>
<p>When we were almost done smoking, Yeon-Hee tilted her head.</p>
<p>“It has been a little over a month since we came back, right? It’s so weird. I will have to look into the details, but it appears that for them, it has been an exceedingly long time since their return. It’s not just a matter of hundreds of years.”</p>
<p>I said, “Star Dragorin is the world that the Old One created as the last battlefield.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Yes, so it has been a long time since the War of the New Devil.”</p>
<p>“The War of the New Devil? I think I know why you named it that way.”</p>
<p>“It’d be faster to show you instead of me explaining about this. What do you think?”</p>
<p>There was only one answer to Yeon-Hee’s two eyes asking for permission. I shook my head to express disapproval. Since joining Doom Kaos’s side… so since I acquired the position of Doom Man, Yeon-Hee had never entered my mental world.</p>
<p>She could sense the power lurking inside me when I responded to the priest's ritual ‘Transition’ by using three hundred points of Power and when I actually transitioned a dungeon. There was a cluster of dreadful energy sealed somewhere inside of me. All I could do with Power was respond to the rituals of the priests or open the gates. However, the energy generated by utilizing three hundred Power figures appeared to open up new possibilities.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a mere feeling, but a strong sense of certainty. It was likely that Doom Kaos had sealed the energy, which made the situation all the more ironic.</p>
<p>[* Also, have your corps remove ‘Holy Knight Caldoran’ or other Holy Knights on earth. The Old One’s power in the Holy Knight will become yours and show you the entrance.]</p>
<p>The command sent by Doom Kaos was teasing and tricking me that I would be able to fully absorb the power of the Old One from Holy Knight. Yes, my Power would increase, and if Doom Kaos felt it was necessary, it would give me new Power skills other than generating gates.</p>
<p>However, that was it. Similar to how the Awakened felt upon their return to the mainland, realizing that there were many things they were capable of, but unable to do so, they too felt the tremendous power that was sealed within them. However, they were constrained to using only the skills that Doom Kaos permitted them to.</p>
<p>If I could only discover the proper way to utilize the Power figures, or in other words, find a means to unleash my sealed strength! Then, the path to challenge the top Dooms would reveal itself. This could ultimately lead to my liberation from Doom Kaos's restriction while simultaneously maintaining peace on earth.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason why I didn’t let Yeon-Hee intervene in my mental world was that no one knew how the power sealed in my body would react to her intervention. I briefly explained this to Yeon-Hee, and she nodded that she understood.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the man in his mid-thirties appeared to have a hardened physique, with a loss of will to live evident in his eyes.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee continued, “The War of New Devil was a legendary battle for the leadership between Doom Kaos and the Old One in the Genesis of Star Dragorin, but it was not merely a myth. It was a true historical event. What makes it even more intriguing is the so-called Holy Knights emerged during the conflict. They were at the forefront of the war against the Seven Demon Kings, much like what we had done in the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee continued explaining through telepathy as she was conscious of Seong-Il.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Holy Knight Caldoran appeared in your command.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Does that mean they have been alive from the Genesis of Dragorin until now?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: I don’t think so. It seems that power had been transferred to the directives of the first Holy Knights, or they might have a system for that. Well… This guy doesn’t know much, but think about it. The funny thing is that he was caught by Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: The first Holy Knight is named Cassian, and he was the most powerful in the War of the New Devil. As I said, whatever I’m telling you now is based on this guy’s knowledge. Anyway, this guy found one page of the archives at a historic site. Then, Seong-Il caught him there.</p>
<p>Seong-Il suddenly whined, “Noona… I have a stomach ache. Ugh… I’m going to go shit first and come back. It’s my first poop of the day.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il ran funny. His stomach ache was simply an excuse, and it was clear that he did so intentionally as he sensed that we were communicating telepathically.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Cassian not only dealt with the War of New Devil. A lot of Dragorin’s powerful magic and supernatural powers that resemble sorcery began from there. Cassian’s archives are a great treasure to them, but they are out of their luck. Mmm… But there is no need to be sad because they would have been killed by a flock of orcs if Seong-Il didn’t catch them. Those orcs over there are more intelligent than these people.</p>
<p>There were many things to hear from Yeon-Hee. The night was going to be long.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Anyway, is that all you can see from them?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Not yet. I need to get into the other one’s mental world.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Then, it would be better to check something before then.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Check what?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Whether or not our human firearms work on them or not. I’m really curious about that because they are not technically humans. They are aliens.</p>
<p>I signaled the agents briefly, after which they located cover and disengaged the safety of their rifles.</p>
<p>“What is that guy’s main weapon?” I asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee responded, “Sword.”</p>
<p>“What about skills?”</p>
<p>“He knows how to handle Mana. You will see.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Wrath.]</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>I manipulated a few thunderbolts to maneuver a sword from the pile of items that Seong-Il had seized while he was in Star Dragorin. Then, the sword droppedl right in front of his leg. Although it was difficult to communicate due to the language barrier, he could feel the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I made sure he picked up the sword with his trembling hand before I reached out to the nearest agent. The agent didn’t grasp what I was asking for at first, but he soon realized when I pointed at his automatic rifle.</p>
<p>The agent placed the rifle in my hand.</p>
<p>1. An instrument for measuring very small intervals of time. ☜</p>

<p>Chapter 357</p>
<p>Combat wizards with the light attribute were required to learn the essential skill called Blind Light. It directly impacted low-level monsters and blinded any higher-level monsters even if they were protected by shields or barriers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of Blind Light frequently appeared in national wars as only a few warriors managed to attain a high enough level of Sense to use it instead of their eyes to see. Blind Light was a Circle Two, low-grade magic, but it was extremely versatile.</p>
<p>Smack!</p>
<p>A sudden stinging sensation on his cheek woke Elland up. As he attempted to open his eyes, he was met with a blinding intensity of light that he recognized as Blind Light. He wondered if the outsider was accompanied by a wizard.</p>
<p>He first tried to use Mana[1] to protect his eyes, but…</p>
<p>Sheek-</p>
<p>A woman’s face burst into his view. Under life-threatening circumstances, an individual’s capabilities and decision-making skills tended to become more heightened than usual. It all happened in a blink of an eye, but he could clearly see her face.</p>
<p>Her small face and beauty evoked images of the Rajania flower in his mind. He observed her raven-black hair and eyes, which were the distinct characteristics of outsiders. He had only heard stories about them and had never imagined that he would meet two of them in one day.</p>
<p>A random thought passed through Elland’s mind even though his situation was dire.</p>
<p>Do outsiders also use magic?</p>
<p>The giant outsider who swept his expedition party was similar to a barbarian warrior. Then, the light pouring down from the sky by Blind Light was used by that small woman.</p>
<p>The girl is a wizard!</p>
<p>As a swordsman, losing the close combat against the wizard would have been a disgraceful outcome. Strangely enough, his body, which had been severely injured by the barbaric outsider’s attack, had fully recovered and returned to its original state. Therefore, he tried to focus all his attention on her.</p>
<p>We should ditch that witch first, then figure out how to get out of here! Lord, please bless and keep me.</p>
<p>It was then he met the woman’s eyes.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Elland felt like he was falling into a void, but there wasn’t a physical sense of falling. However, the bright blinding light vanished in a second, and darkness filled the emptiness. It was pitch black, and he couldn’t see anything. His body was somehow quite stiff, so he couldn’t move. He wondered if this was how a prisoner felt when they were on the gallows with their limbs tied up.</p>
<p>After that moment, Elland’s spirit started to drift further into the distant past.</p>
<p>When Elland regained consciousness, it felt as though he had just woken up from a dream. The sequence of events that led a once immature young boy to devote himself to battling against the Declans and eventually organizing an expedition team in pursuit of fame and fortune felt like a hazy dream.</p>
<p>Although they were undoubtedly good memories, they now felt like dreadful nightmares to Elland, leaving him bewildered by the contradiction. He couldn’t find answers from his past life to explain why he was now standing on the ground with Blind Light once again pouring down upon him.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>Then, his vision began to return. Elland raised his head up unconsciously and realized that the light was radiating from the top of the iron structure that was attached to the ground.</p>
<p>It’s not Blind Light, but… it’s not even an artifact.</p>
<p>Elland was certain because if it were Blind Light, then he wouldn’t be able to see right now. He shifted his gaze in a hurry and looked around. He spotted two people first: the female outsider wizard and a young guy who had just appeared on the spot. Then, he saw other men over their shoulders.</p>
<p>They didn’t appear to be outsiders. They seemed to be from the continent where Elland was from, but they were hidden in rocks and trees while aiming their weapons at him.</p>
<p>There are no blades or spears, but they are definitely weapons.</p>
<p>Elland was confident in his assessment because the men had the eyes of highly trained soldiers who were ready to fight. Weapons were the only things that such men would use against him. If those things weren’t weapons, then they could have been Mana or artifacts that determined the authenticity of the curse.</p>
<p>“Skill eun? (How about the skills?)”</p>
<p>“Ma na reunr- da roor joor al a. Bo myun al guh ya. (Do you know how to deal with Mana? You will know when you see it.)”</p>
<p>Elland blinked and stared at the two outsiders who were speaking in their own language. Of course, he was unfamiliar with the language just as much as he was with their fashion sense. He didn’t understand anything, but he knew something unusual was about to happen.</p>
<p>He recalled the giant outsider who had killed the Orcs and stormed his expedition. The man and woman in front of him were bound to be the monster’s subordinates, and the men in the back looked like they had cooperated with the group of outsiders for a while. Therefore, the only one he could ask for help was…</p>
<p>Malus was lying on the ground a few steps away from him, but he appeared to be of little assistance. After all, he was still unconscious.</p>
<p>“G ruh ji. (That’s right).”</p>
<p>Right then, the voice of an outsider man was cut off. Elland’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Elland was taken aback by the sudden appearance of lightning, particularly because the magic activated without the man uttering a single word. The unexpectedness had caught him off guard. The moment a sword bounced from the location where Malus was lying down, Elland felt like he was literally plunging into a whirlwind of chaos.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence!</p>
<p>The man’s eyes were telling Elland to pick up the sword. He had never heard of outsiders possessing magical abilities, but even if “g ruh ji” was their incantation, he had undeniably witnessed the process of the sword falling before him by the man’s hand.</p>
<p>The lightning power sparked several times in the air as if they were teleporting, moving the sword toward Elland. He had never heard of a guy being able to control bolts of lightning that freely. Well, no. The Holy Knight who dealt with lightning could have managed it like that.</p>
<p>Holy Knight. Holy Knight? What a load of nonsense!</p>
<p>Elland looked at the sword that fell in front of him in a confused manner.</p>
<p>God, please be the witness of your creature. If you do so, I will give you all my property and the rest of my life to you.</p>
<p>Elland had no choice but to pick up the sword. He was a warrior before he was the head of the expedition party. He needed to do his best as he had Lord Lacryma’s protection. The Lord despised those who prayed without trying.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Some time passed.</p>
<p>It’s a weapon as expected…</p>
<p>Elland’s previous speculations were confirmed when the men behind the outsider man passed another weapon to him, making it clear that he intended to challenge Elland.</p>
<p>He even has the ability to handle lightning, but why…?</p>
<p>“A dda. O din gge suh- jik jub ha si neun guh yo? (Gosh, are you doing it by yourself, Odin?)”</p>
<p>Elland turned his head toward the sound and his eyes widened. It was the monster! He had wondered where he was, but he was there! The giant outsider!</p>
<p>He didn’t understand what the hell they were talking about, but it seemed like the giant monster was giving orders to the young outsider. The moment the towering outsider halted with his arm folded, Elland felt a great deal of pressure. He recalled the moment he first met the monster. With each expedition team member he seized and hurled, it appeared as though the entire world was on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p>Just thinking about the moment made Elland have goosebumps.</p>
<p>Why? Why are outsiders attacking us, and why are those people from the Greenwood continents cooperating with them? Why? Fucking why?</p>
<p>Suddenly, something he had forgotten flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>Ah! Saint Cassian’s Book of Records!</p>
<p>Elland inwardly cursed at his stupid self. He definitely touched something he shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Saint Cassian’s record was divided into two categories based on the content. One was the history book that described the War of the New Devil in Genesis from Saint Cassian’s perspective.</p>
<p>The other document was a research report detailing both superlative magical abilities and swordsmanship. Acquiring and merging the contents of this book was crucial to the success or failure of the Holy Knight families, and completing the research was equally essential.</p>
<p>“T…This…”</p>
<p>Elland rummaged through his pocket with a hand that he didn’t hold the sword. His voice also trembled as much as his hand. Next, he pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. To his surprise, the preservation magic that had been cast on it in the past was so potent that it still was completely intact without a hint of decomposition.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for this? But this is part of a history book.”</p>
<p>Elland was willing to confront the Red-Faced Orcs, but not the giant man who was folding his arms in front of him. Even if his two subordinates, the young man who freely handled the lightning power and a woman who used strange mental magic, didn’t step up, Elland’s life was in the hands of the outsider monster.</p>
<p>The treasure would lose all value as it was rendered useless upon his death.</p>
<p>Elland shouted again, “This is not what you guys are looking for!”</p>
<p>“Mok chung eun k ne- ing. (He is hella noisy.)”</p>
<p>“You should check and see it with your own eyes.”</p>
<p>If Cassian’s record book was something that could be torn and burned, then he would have escaped this situation by using it as an excuse. However, that was something that only the devil kings that were mentioned in Genesis could do.</p>
<p>Elland had no regrets, then crumpled the paper and threw it at the giant outsider. As it flew through the air, the conservation magic immediately unfurled the paper and made it flat again.</p>
<p>“Muh? Uh jjuh ra go. (So what?)”</p>
<p>With just a single glance, the giant man seemed to have finished evaluating it, and a perplexed, nonsensical grin spread across his face.</p>
<p>“You and I are both creatures of God. Although our skin and hair colors are different, our start was from God. I swear to the name of our Lord Lacryma, I will never tell what happened today to anyone. I swear. If I violate this, I will gladly accept the curse of the Demon King Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>Elland knew they wouldn’t understand him, but he shouted this earnestly.</p>
<p>“A dda. Si ggeu ruhb ne. Ji deul iee mun juh dum byu no ko. (Gosh, he talks too much. You guys are the ones who attacked first.)”</p>
<p>The giant outsider shifted his glance to the young male outsider.</p>
<p>“Joi song huh yo. Ju ddae moon in guh ga teun di… Bba jiguh sso. (I’m sorry. I think he is doing this because of me… I will step out.)”</p>
<p>What the hell is he saying to that guy? Please, please. Please take this and let me go.</p>
<p>1. A concept in fantasy and video games referring to a form of magical energy or power that characters can use to cast spells, perform abilities, or activate magical items. Apparently it’s one of the stats in this continent. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 358</p>
<p>After uttering something in an incomprehensible language, the giant outsider left while everyone else stayed behind. Elland became more anxious as the guy handling the lightning power and others remaining showed no sign that he was going to be let go. His anxiety mounted to the point where he had difficulty swallowing his saliva.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p>“So eum gi. (Suppressor)”</p>
<p>The guy wielding the lightning received a small metal tool from a man in the back and affixed it to the end of his weapon.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Electricity surged from the tips of his fingers, producing a stunning display of lightning bolts filling the air one by one. However, Elland’s realization dawned when the bolts converged and formed a mesh-like pattern in the sky, revealing the man’s true intention. He gasped.</p>
<p>He’s trapped the entire area!</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the area enveloped by the lightning mesh was large enough to move around in, Elland found no gaps to escape. As he observed the man’s skill over the electricity, Elland realized he was no match for him.</p>
<p>Elland said while holding a sword in his hand. “I gave you the treasure of Saint Cassian. D…do we really have to go this far?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that there was no way to get out. If he could defeat the man, then the enchanted lightning mesh would dissipate with him. It appeared that the man wanted to bring out Elland’s full fighting potential as he made a gesture at him.</p>
<p>Is this really the end… This is how I die? Why me…</p>
<p>Elland noticed that he couldn’t avoid death because even if he tried decapitating the man, the witch wouldn’t just sit back and let him do so. Also, the giant outsider would be around and jump into him too!</p>
<p>Elland looked around, and the giant guy was actually staring at him from afar. His imposing figure appeared even more frightening, shrouded in darkness. Therefore, Elland noticed that begging for mercy on his knees wouldn’t help at all.</p>
<p>The eyes of those from the continent who cooperated with the outsiders trembled, but they were all weak even if they were protected by the Lord’s blessing. They would chicken out as soon as the giant guy roared.</p>
<p>Those from the continent who sided with the outsiders looked at Elland with quivering eyes, possibly out of guilt or pity for his predicament. Even with the Lord’s protection, they were feeble and would cower at the sound of the giant guy’s thunderous roar.</p>
<p>This must be the end…</p>
<p>No matter how many times he tried to devise an escape plan, Elland concluded that there was no possible way out. He completed his painful calculations and then channeled his Mana to its fullest potential.</p>
<p>Srrr.</p>
<p>His entire body and sword were immediately filled with warmth, and the sword turned a copper color. His blood coursed through his veins at an accelerated rate, leaving him feeling more alive than ever before. The beginning stage of his Sword User[1] had helped him survive multiple times in the past. Well… It was now guiding him to death.</p>
<p>Elland aimed his sword at the guy handling the lightning with a bitter taste in his mouth and a pounding heart.</p>
<p>“You may think it’s simple to take my life, but I guarantee that you will lose at least one limb. If you don’t exert yourself fully, then I will behead you right away.”</p>
<p>Although they wouldn’t understand what he was saying, he bolstered his own spirits. Then, he was able to shake off some of his fear of death by harnessing the power surging within him.</p>
<p>Right then, Elland’s attention was drawn to the movement of the man’s fingers, specifically the index finger inside the ring at the bottom of the weapon. He noticed that it moved slightly.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>He heard the sound of something colliding with each other.</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>A sharp pain shot through his abdomen, quickly giving way to a burning sensation that radiated throughout the area. The sensation was familiar, and he had undoubtedly experienced it before.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Elland clenched his teeth and looked at where it hurt. Blood was flowing out from the cut. Despite the pain coursing through his abdomen, there was no indication that his body had been impaled by a sharp weapon or penetrated by a potent spell.</p>
<p>Ah, I let my guard down too much. What kind of artifact is that? I have never seen such a thing…</p>
<p>Elland regretted his initial belief that the man’s weapon was merely a weapon, realizing too late that it held formidable power. He had been preparing to focus his Mana when the man’s lightning power erupted. Although wizards used shields and swordsmen used barriers, both relied on the same fundamental principle of using Mana to create them.</p>
<p>As a result, people had to be careful in distributing their limited amount of Mana, but the opponent’s weapon ability was unbelievable. In fact, Elland wasn’t sure if the man’s attack started from that weapon. The pain continued to ravage his body and caused him to lose his composure, and he knew that his death was imminent.</p>
<p>That was why he was determined to emit all his Mana. One fortunate thing was that the opponent didn’t attack him again. The man watched Elland suffer with an indifferent gaze as though he was observing an experiment.</p>
<p>In a desperate bid, Elland channeled all of his Mana, risking his life. Then, a barrier enveloped his body while emitting a brilliant copper light as it materialized. Following that, additional layers with the same color light appeared and repeated the process.</p>
<p>In the past, Elland had always held tightly onto his sword when he led his expedition party into historic sites because of this. As much as he was driven by his desire to discover a relic imbued with the Lord’s holiness, he wanted to be surrounded by a radiant silver light from his sword even more. However, he knew that this dream would remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Elland starred at the man with rage,</p>
<p>“Bo ho mak. (Barrier).”</p>
<p>When the man mumbled to himself, Elland saw the chance to attack him for the first time.</p>
<p>He screamed and charged toward the man, “What the hell are you talking about?!”</p>
<p>The warm glow of copper enveloped him as he lifted his sword as high as he could. The radiant light seemed to be urging him on, encouraging him to take down his opponent. Elland believed that if his assumption that the opponent was a powerful wizard with lightning attributes was correct, then he still had a chance to win because it was a close-range battle!</p>
<p>The sharp and searing pain overwhelmed his abdomen, but Elland focused solely on his goal and pushed himself forward. He moved faster than he ever had before, spurred on by his own determination and willpower.</p>
<p>At the moment of life and death, swordsmen were known to push beyond their limits, and Elland was no exception. Despite the danger he faced, he felt a newfound confidence in his abilities and moved with a speed he had never achieved before. As he ran, he couldn’t help but wonder if this was what he felt like to reach the next level of Sword User.</p>
<p>When the Mana that he distributed throughout his body reached its maximum, it made his movements more precise than ever. He could feel himself slicing through the air like a blade. The pain that twisted his abdomen vanished instantly. Elland had actually shattered the wall to reach the intermediate level of Sword User. At last, he had achieved the same rank as Malus!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, things were going weird. Elland attempted to absorb the energy of Mother Nature into his body as more spaces were made due to the increased Mana. He believed that even the smallest amount he could manage would be beneficial in a moment of crisis. However, he was unable to sense any Mana flowing into him from Mother Nature.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Mother Nature had no Mana.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with my body?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he wasn’t in a situation where he could ponder about the situation. Because he was rushing in, Elland could see the guy’s face zooming in and that his neck was completely exposed. As he threw himself forward, his Mana flowed from his sword in an arc heading down.</p>
<p>I will strike him with a vertical blow, cleaving his skull from crown to groin. I will for sure witness his inner organs with my own eyes!</p>
<p>Elland raised his sword high. Next, the sound of his stomach being pierced drilled into his ears, and it continued unabated, with a sequence of explosive noises occurring one after another.</p>
<p>Tadadadadada-</p>
<p>Prior to that moment, Elland had solely been focused on defeating the man. As his vision became blurry, the sound seemed to taunt him, as if a malevolent entity were cackling at his impending death. The evil emitted a stench and expelled its saliva, which was coated with iron, in all directions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Tadadadadada-</p>
<p>My firearm’s barrel had become heated, permeating the air with the scent of burning charcoal, while the pungent smell of gunpowder lingered in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The guy crashed on his way toward me. He was rushing in at quite a fast pace. Seong-Il said he would be around the bronze section if he was Awakened, but his speed was equivalent to those in the silver section when he ricocheted back.</p>
<p>If I had been standing closer to him, his sword would have fallen on my head. Well, of course, it wouldn’t have been able to even touch my hair anyway.</p>
<p>At that moment, he rose from the ground directly in front of me. The additional bullets had left him unscathed as I had stopped firing the trigger once I observed his shield beginning to shatter.</p>
<p>I checked his whole body again, but there was no item on him. He was holding a sword, yet it lacked the strength to withstand a defensive barrier. This indicated that the F-class shield he had just possessed was his own creation.</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>I kicked him away, then asked Yeon-Hee telepathically.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Are there many people like him here?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: No, he is actually one of the strongest in that world.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: He made a shield by himself.</p>
<p>It was more than just a shield. Despite possessing physical abilities more akin to a civilian, his capabilities had surged instantaneously.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: That’s why I said you will figure it out when you see them in person. What do you think?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: It’s interesting. So you are saying that he is on another level in this world.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: If you consider those who can handle Mana as Awakened, it’s similar to our world. Most soldiers here can’t control Mana.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Our firearms will work to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Of course, I needed to ascertain whether firearms were operational in that realm and whether the Old One’s influence extended here. Yet, the shields they forged resembled the ones we used. The only distinction was that these individuals could craft them independently, whereas we required ‘items’ to use it. In terms of superiority, their capabilities extended beyond merely acquiring items.</p>
<p>When I turned my head, I made eye contact with Yeon-Hee. She appeared to be thinking the same thing that I did. Yeon-Hee’s eyes narrowed as she contemplated deeply.</p>
<p>“Ugh…” the man groaned.</p>
<p>The man took a lengthier amount of time to writhe on the ground while clutching his bullet wound.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Not here. I am unable to perceive the existence of what they refer to as Mana.</p>
<p>As expected, Yeon-Hee was thinking the same thing as me. She was devising a way to create our own shield without using items by gathering information from the guy’s memory.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>I knew what Yeon-Hee was expecting.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: No.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: It’s not just the shield. This is merely my assumption, but if Mana, as they call it, and the power bestowed upon us by the Old One are identical, it stands to reason that the power to create shields lies dormant within us. If we can feel and use it as much as they can, then our abilities will not be limited to items and skills.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was hoping that the Awakened could advance to this world. Although she knew that my Life Vessel was within her, she seemed to have decided that it was worth taking such an adventure.</p>
<p>However, my reason for stopping her wasn’t only because my resurrection depended on her. This was a battlefield where nothing was known yet. All we knew was that there were Holy Knights. Since we didn’t know anything about the Old One’s other troops, we couldn’t jeopardize her life as a bargaining chip.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Listen to me carefully. There is a Holy Knight family that created the Great Wizard, and their wealth of knowledge is likely substantial. There must be someone among them who has expertise not only in magic, but also in the truth of this realm. Whether we capture or visit them, we must investigate them at least once. You are not going to be under Doom Kaos forever, right?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Let’s think about it a little more. There is no need to hurry.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Then what are you keeping the returning stone for? Seon-Hu, it’s me. Mary, the Bitch. Do you think I won’t be able to pull myself out during an emergency?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee added.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: You were looking for a way to use your Power as well. Magic must be the answer. Trust your teacher, Seon-Hu. I will be the Grand Wizard.</p>
<p>1. A sword user in a world with Mana can channel their magical power through their sword, imbuing their strikes with magical energy and casting spells through their sword to increase their combat effectiveness. ☜</p>

<p>Chapter 359</p>
<p>Ronsius was on the brink of offering aid to his long-term friend King Gemilan’s kingdom. Given their proximity to the Baclans, he concluded they would require more assistance than the dukedom. In addition, theduchy had already been stable following the arrival of the Red-Faced Orcs.</p>
<p>It would take him half a year to get to King Gemilan’s kingdom, so Ronsius was in a hurry from the early morning. The wagon he customized for himself resembled a small library. The Archmage Ronsius didn’t need an escort, but the reason why he prepared the family’s knights and wizards separately was to not be disturbed.</p>
<p>While he was packing Saint Cassian’s archives in his bag, his granddaughter came over.</p>
<p>“Count Stean is here.”</p>
<p>A group of people had come to visit him. One of the duke’s agents who had infiltrated Ronsius’s family must have already informed them. Though uncertain about their intentions for detaining him here, Ronsius remained resolute in his determination to help his friend this time.</p>
<p>“Tell them that I have been stuck in the lab for days.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “I already did, but they keep saying that they must see you right now.”</p>
<p>“Did they tell you what is going on?” he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. “They said it’s about the Red-Faced Orcs.”</p>
<p>Ronsius heard earlier that there was a mysterious incident in the barony of Baran.</p>
<p>His granddaughter added, “Some people came from the temple.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a big enough deal for them to be involved… Put the wagon away first.”</p>
<p>“I have already done that. Count Stean and the priests are waiting in the guest room.”</p>
<p>When she was younger, she was an endearing child, but Ronsius’s strict discipline had caused her to gradually lose her charming smile. Instead, a stern, chilly demeanor was now settled on her face. Ronsius was always taken aback by her frigid countenance, but he knew it was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Her magical abilities surpassed those of any other family member, and she was likely to be the next generation’s Holy Knight. Therefore, training his granddaughter with strict discipline was only natural. However, it was heartbreaking that he couldn’t see her smile again.</p>
<p>After I die, this entire family will be yours. But you are a girl, so you have to be stronger, Sylvia. Can you not find joy there? Everyone wants to be you and envies you.</p>
<p>Ronsius swallowed the words he impulsively wanted to say as he followed his granddaughter from behind.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the guests stood up to show respect to Ronsius. As his granddaughter had mentioned, Count Stean had come to personally visit, and even the priests from the newly-built temple were in attendance.</p>
<p>The conversation started with a greeting along with some refreshments, then Ronsius heard an unexpected word.</p>
<p>“There was an oracle in Elsland, Mr. Ronsius.”</p>
<p>Even Ronsius’s granddaughter, who seemed to have lost her ability to feel, widened her eyes in surprise. The presence of an oracle from the Lord Lacryma denomination in the Great Palace of Elsland was a significant event.</p>
<p>Ronsius fixed his loose posture and looked at his granddaughter. As expected, his quick-witted granddaughter was leaving the room. Following that, all the other guests tactfully left except for one remaining priest.</p>
<p>“What kind of oracle is it that Elsland sent a message all the way here?” he asked curiously.</p>
<p>The priest grimly responded, “Elsland said, ‘the night is coming.’”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ronsius immediately suspended his plans to leave for King Gemilan’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Darkness is coming into this world…</p>
<p>The investigation team was set up by Count Stean and the duchy’s priest, and they said they had found clear evidence of the oracle at the site where the Red-Faced Orc Clan was slaughtered, at the southern end of the Baran barony.</p>
<p>In fact, the recent movements of monsters had been unusual. Ronsius had heard a rumor that a moving corpse was discovered in the Zeromia Sea between the south and Deathland. Some stories emerged that spoke of a ghost ship brimming with lifeless bodies.</p>
<p>Likewise, the reason why King Gemilan had solicited assistance was comparable. He cited that the Baclans had abruptly adopted sophisticated strategic tactics, making it challenging to get a victory.</p>
<p>Ronsius wrote a letter apologizing to his friend King Gemilan. Knowing that the king would have heard about the oracle, Ronsius candidly explained why he couldn’t make it there, stating that it wasn’t the opportune moment for him to be away for an extended period. He needed to restructure the family in accordance with the oracle’s guidance. The sentences that were similar to what he would have written during his heyday filled the letter.</p>
<p>A month had passed since Ronsius began restructuring the family, and on that day, he was inside the magic tower. The tower served two primary functions. It could be used to contact a specific wizard organization or to refer to the towers constructed within a structure that harnessed mana.</p>
<p>Ronsius’s magic tower encompassed both of these contexts. It served as the headquarters of a magical organization established by him and also as a structure that concentrated Mana. Not only was it far from his mansion with a river located in between, and it was placed in an area where there was no residence around it.</p>
<p>The area surrounding the tower was previously a barren wasteland. However, due to its function as a mana collection site, it had been transformed into a lush forest in just a decade. Looking down from the top of the tower, the surrounding area looked peaceful. The forests where wizards meditated in Mother Nature resembled the kingdom of ancient elves who used the forest as their base. It also appeared as if time had stopped.</p>
<p>However, there was no peace on Ronsius’s face.</p>
<p>Dadada- Dadadak-</p>
<p>Then a blood-soaked horse broke in toward the tower. Ronsius would not normally appear on the top of the tower, but he was throwing himself out of the window and flying down slowly like a falling leaf. Usually the wind pressure would have swept him up, but his gray beard and robe remained still as if nothing was happening.</p>
<p>The knight waited for Ronsius, the archmage and Holy Knight, to step down in front of him, then squeezed his voice out while enduring his pain, “T…the castle… castle collapsed… Please… p… please help us…”</p>
<p>Ronsius looked at the rose tattoo embedded in the knight’s chest. It was Baron Baran’s logo. The orcs wouldn’t have broken the agreement, so he wondered if the ‘night’ that the oracle mentioned a month ago had started.</p>
<p>Ronsius activated a spell inscribed deep inside his heart, causing a blue aura to fill his eyes as he muttered a brief incantation. As the energy dissipated, his eyes turned completely white, with the black pupils seemingly erased.</p>
<p>While his physical body remained in front of the knight, Ronsius’s consciousness was transported inside Baron Baran’s castle. He began to move around the castle with great haste. Things seemed to have progressed further than what the knight had described earlier.</p>
<p>Ronsius found the body of the decapitated baron. He was a luxurious man who loved jewelry, but nothing remained on his dead body except for blood. Ronsius felt no sympathy for his death as he wasn’t happy with him as a ruler of a territory. It was the same when he found the dead baroness and their kids not too far away.</p>
<p>Ronsius quickly passed through the bloody corridor and broke through the wall.</p>
<p>Seuk-</p>
<p>From above, Ronsius grasped the situation within a glance. The battle had concluded, and the invaders had successfully taken control of the castle. It was evident which side was which. The trapped individuals lined up on one side were from the barony within the duchy, while the victorious invaders were yelling at them from the other side. According to the oracle, they were the ones who brought the night.</p>
<p>But they look just like us.</p>
<p>Although they were dressed bizarrely, the invaders shared the same triumphant expressions as the conquerors in this world. They possessed the typical human features of two eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and stood firmly on the ground with two feet. They were unlike the hound-headed Declans or the ox-headed Baclans. That came as a shock to Ronsius.</p>
<p>I thought they would look like hideous monsters…but they are the same as us.</p>
<p>Ronsius discovered something else that was unusual. The number of intruders was too small. Aside from where they appeared, no matter how much he shifted his gaze to the distance, there was no such thing as a follow-up squad. A total of thirty of them were either beating up the prisoners or searching the inside of the castle. They were the only ones here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dead bodies of the baron’s soldiers were all over the place. He could find traces of powerful magic, and those swept away by it were destroyed. However, another thing that was indescribable was that other bodies looked intact.</p>
<p>Ronsius hastily turned his head.</p>
<p>Tadadadada-!</p>
<p>His attention was focused on the three invaders who were methodically searching the castle. More specifically, he was attuned to the clanging of the iron objects they were carrying, which emitted sparks.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Although none of the soldiers rushing toward the intruders belonged to the ranks of a Sword User, their unyielding fighting spirit remained steadfast even after the baron’s death and the fall of the castle. Ronsius was furious for the first time when he witnessed the scene of such soldiers dying in vain as he finally realized how the people with intact bodies had died.</p>
<p>Most of them died without being able to properly fire an arrow or throw a spear. It was heartbreaking to imagine how they felt.</p>
<p>Ronsius looked at the group leading the invaders. They were armed with artifacts. There were five of them total, and one exhibited the movements equivalent to that of a first-level Sword Expert could do, while the remaining four displayed movements that were equivalent to that of upper-level Sword Users.</p>
<p>One Sword Expert. Four Sword Users. Twenty-five soldiers carrying weird objects.</p>
<p>That was the formation of intruders, and Ronsius now faced a dilemma. If he used the Mana power concentrated in the tower, he could kill them as easily as they killed the baron’s soldiers. However, there were still many surviving prisoners in the castle. Therefore, that wasn’t the best choice.</p>
<p>I should burn them.</p>
<p>Ronsius blinked his eyes, and he returned to his original position. At the final blink, his pupils shifted to the center of his white eyes, indicating his rage at the sight of the massacre.</p>
<p>Right then…</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>A mysterious light rose over Ronsius’s head. He hadn’t given any special instructions, but all the magicians were going into the tower. But that wasn’t the end. They were moving the Mana concentrated in the tower.</p>
<p>Woooong-</p>
<p>The grass and leaves of the forest were leaning toward the tower as if they were blown by gale.</p>
<p>What the hell did they do?</p>
<p>Ronsius’s grey hair fluttered violently, and his sense of bewilderment intensified. He struggled to make sense of the situation at hand. It was highly improbable that a student would have the audacity to manipulate the tower’s Mana without his direction.</p>
<p>In addition, another absurd thing that was happening was that the baron’s knight was laughing wildly. He appeared as if he was about to die and fall off the horse, but he was standing on both feet and laughing at him.</p>
<p>Anyway, Ronsius realized that the tower’s Mana was beginning to form a barrier. This extensive barrier enveloped the entire nearby forest and served as one of the defense mechanisms established for when the tower was under duress.</p>
<p>The knight kept laughing at the back of Ronsius’ head as Ronsius was running toward the tower.</p>
<p>“Fucking old man. You have got something fun to play with, haven’t you? No one will be able to disturb us now. You can look forward to it,” the knight shouted.</p>
<p>“How dare you?!”</p>
<p>Ronsius turned his head, only to find his granddaughter Sylvia standing where the knight had been. She was even smiling, which Ronisus thought he would never be able to see. Although it was a mischievous smile, it momentarily caught him off guard.</p>
<p>Of course, it didn’t take long for him to realize that he was hallucinating. Ronsius was unsure of the origins of his hallucinations or what caused them, but he was convinced that the Holy Knight had fallen under the influence of a potent attacker capable of inducing such visions.</p>
<p>“Who are you…?” Ronsius asked the presence who was using his granddaughter’s face.</p>
<p>She responded in a taunting manner, “What kind of grandfather doesn’t recognize his granddaughter?”</p>
<p>The presence that resembled his granddaughter then laughed and whispered. Ronsius had never encountered someone who dared to taunt him since he had achieved the rank of Holy Knight, so the experience sent shivers down his spine. To make matters worse, the opponent seemed entirely at ease even in the presence of a Holy Knight who was also an archmage.</p>
<p>At that time, an eerie thought passed through Ronsius’s mind. When he looked back at the wizards through the windows of the tower, the presence in the face of Sylvia whispered again.</p>
<p>“It’s no use. Who do you think gave instructions to your men? To them, I’m the Holy Knight Ronsius. You are the villain. So let’s not lean on them, and just play amongst ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Just answer the question. Who are you…”</p>
<p>“The game depends on it. Will you ever find out my name?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 360</p>
<p>All-source Situation Room at the World Awakened Association Headquarters.</p>
<p>The general situation room was filled with subtle blue light from a large monitor. On the five hundred-inch long monitor, the program presented the location of the Awakened as a dot on the world map, which was connected to a Geographic Information System (GIS). Many of the dots were disappearing as the Awakened were entering the other world at the moment.</p>
<p>However, the information presented wasn’t detailed. Most of the dots overlapped because the location of the Awakened was displayed as dots.</p>
<p>Lee Ga-Hee didn’t have the authority to handle the central monitor, so she couldn’t zoom in to a location and split the monitor to show the personal information of the key Awakened. That was solely the responsibility of the head of the situation office to lead the department by displaying information on a large monitor. Therefore, Lee Ga-Hee was a mere employee who had been dispatched from the Korean branch to the general situation room of the association’s headquarters.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, Lee Ga-Hee was also watching the monitor. Awakened from other countries were among the groups of three or five moving dots.</p>
<p>However, she wasn’t paying attention to the Awakened of foreign nationalities who had entered Korea. After all, those people were subsidized by conglomerates groups such as Jeonil, Ilsung, and Daehyun. In addition, they had been approved to use the passageways open to Korea.</p>
<p>「World Awakened Association, “First Day of Extraterrestrial Arrival, a Monumental Step.”」</p>
<p>Furthermore, she wasn’t listening to the media talking about how long they had been waiting for this day. One of her duties was to send the location of the Awakened to the Security Bureau if they committed a crime, so keeping a close eye on breaking news was one of her tasks.</p>
<p>Then, information about a dungeon in Korea grasped her attention.</p>
<p>「 Registration number: A - 92</p>
<p>Location: Ronsius Holy Knight (Franklin Dukedom, Greenwood Continent)</p>
<p>Status: Entering」</p>
<p>That was the only dungeon in Korea that was in an entry state. Lee Ga-Hee had not heard about it before.</p>
<p>It was the first day of the Awakened entering the extraterrestrial space. She knew that the association had established a reconnaissance team composed of parties and attack teams with significant private capital. Consequently, she was designated as a mandatory checkpoint that these teams had to go through before entering.</p>
<p>What if there was an error in the middle? What if the Korean branch is making a mistake?</p>
<p>Although the association practiced a lot using the first day of entry as D-day, it was inevitable that mistakes would happen on the first day. Lee Ga-Hee was suspicious that that would have been the case now.</p>
<p>「 Not permitted to log in. 」</p>
<p>She raised her hand, looking at the message. A man with broad shoulders walked over quickly from a distance. The middle-aged man was the chief of the department.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that you can’t access it because it’s an operational area within the association. But good catch. Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p>After relaxing a bit, Lee Ga-Hee recalled that the chief was a general who was in a high position in the U.S. Department of Defense. She felt like she was in the middle of a huge military operation.</p>
<p>As she looked around, she noticed details that had escaped her notice earlier due to her tension. Lee Ga-Hee was under immense pressure to avoid making any mistakes, identify any flaws, and make significant contributions to the association. The high-tech facilities in the situation room, combined with the presence of individuals dispatched from branches worldwide, added to the already heightened tension. On top of that, men with guns that she would have seen only in movies were standing guard next to each door.</p>
<p>She somehow felt like her body was heating up. Her heart pounded, and her fingertips tickled with a strange excitement. She noticed that where she was, where different languages were spoken all over the place, was the most secretive place in the world right now. She was proud of herself for taking part here.</p>
<p>Right then her phone rang with a notification message. An encrypted chat window popped up on the screen.</p>
<p>&lt;Room One, Director Yoo (Korean Branch): No. E-49. Entering right now. Check.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Situation Room, Lee Ga-Hee: Yes.&gt;</p>

<p>Lee Ga-Hee put extra pressure on her fingertips as she entered the approval code.</p>
<p>Click, click.</p>
<p>The personal information of the five members of the association was displayed on her personal monitor. She expanded the map of the area in Suwon City, registered as E-49, then began to send out the location where five dots disappeared.</p>
<p>&lt;Situation Room, Lee Ga-Hee: Entry completed.&gt;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Room One, World Awakened Association Korea Branch.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin, the Director of Room One, was having a meeting with an uninvited guest.</p>
<p>The time has come.</p>
<p>The guest was the senior vice president of Daehyun Group, Jeong Woo-Seok. Yoo Won-Jin had only seen his name on the approval documents. He had never seen him in person before, as Jeong Woo-Seok never made an appearance at the company headquarters.</p>
<p>“Director Yoo is from our group, so I thought you would take care of us, haha.”</p>
<p>However, Yoo Won-Jin didn’t feel any pressure from Jeong Woo-Seok as various figures from the business community had been in contact with him since he moved his work to the association.</p>
<p>The best meeting he remembered was with the President of Finance, Park Choong-Sik. There were rumors about his death, but the old man showed off his robustness a lot. Remembering the meeting with him, Jeong Woo-Seok was no more special than anyone else. Thanks to the information that he naturally learned while focusing on the association’s work, there was no hint of any walls of status between them as they had already been broken down,</p>
<p>“Hmm… Why are we not getting the approval?”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin sympathized with Jeong Woo-Seok’s apprehension. Although the information had not yet been released to the media, there were sources available to large corporations who kept their ears to the ground.</p>
<p>The association’s plan to open up an era of space colonization was a profit-making venture, which included an internal directive that they would not get involved in matters related to land and resource ownership. The directive resembled the practice during the age of navigation, where explorers would claim by planting a flag, thereby declaring it to belong to their conquering group.</p>
<p>The association only wanted one thing from the Awakened: conquer the extraterrestrial space.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details of the conditions for approval, but I just wanted to let you know that it may seem unfair on the surface.”</p>
<p>“Today is only the first day.”</p>
<p>“But none of our plans have been approved.”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin spread his hands open. “Why are you telling me this? I don’t have that much power. I’m just an employee. And wouldn’t it be safer to wait for the other attackers to return and gather more information about the aliens before entering?”</p>
<p>“That’s what we think. The Awakened are in a different position. They will think that the association is depriving them of opportunities.”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin shook his head inwardly as he couldn’t say that only the Awakened who were hired by the Daehyun Group thought like that. The capital forces that reached the association’s leadership had one thing in common, whether they aggressively lobbied or utilized their connections to gain influence. It was that the entry plan they submitted was concentrated in a place called Franklin Dukedom.</p>
<p>In fact, not long after, higher-ups issued an instruction to approve only the plan for the Franklin Dukedom.</p>
<p>“Director Yoo… Did we get on the wrong side of the association?” Jeong Woo-Seok asked.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin responded, “No way. Even if there were any biases, the association is fairer than you might think. Once the returnees are back, the guidelines for granting approval will naturally become clear.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think one day will determine ten years… no one hundred years?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I won’t change the subject. You would know that we have a lot of defense companies in our group. We have plenty of room, so I’m confident that we will be able to do much more than Jeonil if we advance to outer space. Then, when that time comes, I will never forget how much of a help you were. If it’s actually hard for you to do, then just connect me to one person, please. I heard he is Korean.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Vice President!” Yoo Won-Jin raised his voice without realizing it, then he lowered his voice as he was conscious of the people outside of the room. “You’d better not talk about him because I can't even talk to him.”</p>
<p>“That’s how urgent I am. Jeonil has literally devoured this country. What about Jonathan Investment Finance Group? They took control of the world. If the higher-ups really think that they should also monopolize outer space… What can I do? I have no choice but to stop.”</p>
<p>At that time, Yoo Won-Jin received a short message.</p>
<p>「 Honey, I’m out at the shopping mall with the Daehyun President’s wife. I won’t be late for dinner. Sorry! 」</p>
<p>Ugh, she is doing this again. Stop. Just stop hanging out with her.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin quickly straightened his crumpled expression and raised his head. Then, he saw Jeong Woo-Seok’s anxious face. A new era of navigation unfolded, but he was unable to move to the sea despite the multiple ships he possessed.</p>
<p>What Jeong Woo-Seok said was true. The number of entries processed by the Korean branch today was only one of Jeonil’s squads.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the situation on the foreign side was active. There was already a famous figure in this world. His name was Chris, a Wall Street financier who had hit the jackpot on the Day of Advent, and he said he built the system and manpower faster than anyone else. The performance of foreign capital, led by him, was remarkable.</p>
<p>But isn’t the Jeonil Group, the only one who has entered space, technically a foreign capital?</p>
<p>Although the Ilsung Group was scheduled to enter in a few days, it was far short in light of the current status of active foreign capital.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we have at least one more in Korea besides Ilsung?</p>
<p>Upon reflection, Yoo Won-Jin realized that Daehyun Group would never be able to directly contact the association’s leadership. In the eyes of the super-wealthy figures in the business world, such as the King of Hell Jonathan Hunter, or Osiris Jonathan von Karjan, the Daehyun group would be considered insignificant.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin made a decision.</p>
<p>“It’s a fact that will be known to the public soon.”</p>
<p>When Yoo Won-Jin opened his mouth, Jeong Woo-Seok corrected his posture and paid attention.</p>
<p>“This approval is limited to the Franklin Duchy…”</p>
<p>“Franklin Duchy… Why?”</p>
<p>“It must be a small country. The higher-ups must intend to settle first and gradually expand the realm of humanity there.”</p>
<p>“T…then, how many dungeons are left in Korea?”</p>
<p>“There is none left. There would be nothing even if you look abroad.”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin refrained from mentioning that the allocation had already been decreased due to foreign capital. Jeong Woo-Seok’s face began to regain hope when he noticed Yoo Won-Jin’s smile and the way his upper body was tilted toward him. Yoo Won-Jin’s voice was so quiet that Jeong Woo-Seok could barely hear him by putting his ears close to his mouth.</p>
<p>“Try modifying your entry point to the Land of Whirlpool. Before it gets too late.”</p>
<p>Jeong Woo-Seok was touched.</p>
<p>The approval guidelines of the Land of Whirlpool were just released this morning. The leadership of the association seemed to believe that they would easily occupy the Franklin Dukedom.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin wondered how many years would it have taken for him to obtain such authority and social status if he had remained in the Daehyun Group. Under the assumption that he would never be kicked out after dedicating his entire life, he would have been barely promoted.</p>
<p>In that sense, moving to the association was a successful gamble.</p>
<p>“We will see each other more often in the future, Mr. Vice President.” Yoo Won-Jin stretched his hand out to shake hands. “Going to outer space is important, but you’d better take care of your health first.”</p>
<p>Jeong Woo-Seok held Yoo Won-Jin’s hand with both of his hands.</p>
<p>“I will…never forget your help.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il had left, but I remained at that spot in case of a possible crisis. I hoped that I would be able to wear her down, but things had progressed such that we agreed that we would bring the entire Franklin Dukedom to war and then I would be accompanied by Seong-Il.</p>
<p>It was almost time for darkness to fall, and nights in the hills came faster than flat land. The area around the A-92 dungeon, which led to the Holy Knight Ronsius’s area, had been left empty from the beginning, so it was natural that there was no light in the darkness like other areas.</p>
<p>「Warning</p>
<p>Civilian Restricted Area</p>
<p>This area is subject to the World Awakened Association Membership Agreement and people are strictly prohibited from entering the area outside of accreditation.</p>
<p>World Awakened Association」</p>
<p>Ssss-</p>
<p>As I traversed the barbed wire that was marked with the warning sign, I caught sight of some red lights. The reddest of the bunch emerged from the depths of the necromancer’s hood, shrouded in darkness. As Joshua’s crimson gaze dissipated, the members of the plague squad who trailed him arrived with their heads lowered.</p>
<p>Their presence exuded a sense of darkness even though they didn’t make a grim sound. Even Seong-Il often avoided Joshua, saying that he felt overwhelmed by Joshua’s eyes.</p>
<p>I had no doubt that these people who gave off such a nightmare vibe would open the door for me to enter the world of Franklin Dukedom. Other than for Yeon-Hee, they had the strongest firepower out of all the Awakened.</p>
<p>I said, “You should know what you need to deal with.”</p>
<p>Joshua responded immediately, “Holy Knight Caldoran of the Land of Whirlpool. I will cut his head and offer it to you.”</p>
<p>I had purposely set the dungeon with the closest passage to the Holy Knight aside.</p>
<p>I continued, “Go to the Cat Food Warehouse before entering. You will be able to check your equipment.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” Joshua said.</p>
<p>The Holy Knight would have no idea what was getting closer to him, so Caldoran would be pitiful as much as the one who was facing Yeon-Hee now.</p>
<p>I looked at Joshua, who was already filling the darkness inside his hood with murderous intentions, then nodded briefly. Joshua and his squad vanished within one second as if they were the gods of death who didn’t exist in this world.</p>

<p>Chapter 361</p>
<p>Ten thousand tons of gold were being transported from Shanghai Port to New York Port. Although it was an extraordinary operation, the media only covered a few brief articles about it because public attention was fixated on a mercenary. This individual wasn’t the first to set foot on an extraterrestrial planet like Neil Armstrong, but he would be forever recognized as the first person to return from outer space.</p>
<p>“We won a perfect victory with no casualties. Our enemies were helpless as they had no chance of winning.”</p>
<p>I was watching his interview with the Chinese leader who had made a confidential visit to Korea. When I gestured to him to be quiet, the cheers and applause from the interview site became louder and filled the suite. The interview was chaotic, but the hotel staff who were receiving the VVIP would have been the busiest people.</p>
<p>The interviewer asked, “Umm… but where are the others?”</p>
<p>“I came back to just report. It is true that we have successfully occupied the area, but the danger hasn’t been resolved yet. Through operations that govern the occupied territories and quickly establish links with other groups…”</p>
<p>The mercenary appeared to be suppressing his emotions. He wasn’t guilty, but he seemed to be trying to get rid of the excitement he felt from the battlefield.</p>
<p>The mercenaries were responsible for protecting oil drilling facilities and diamond mines in the areas affected by civil war and were sometimes involved in resisting or supporting coups. In the event that their superiors issued orders, they were even required to use lethal force against civilians. Therefore, the battle carried out in outer space was just one of the missions they had to complete as long as they were paid a lot of money.</p>
<p>I said to the Chinese leader while pointing at the mercenary on the television as I needed to clarify something, “You are not the only one who is interested in this. The American and Russian members are all crazy about this, but the civilian population entering the extraterrestrial world will be limited to mercenaries and scientists.”</p>
<p>Our interpreter was Yang Ga-Hye, an Awakened who I had met once before.</p>
<p>The Chinese Leader now found a way to revive his country, whose fate had fallen into the abyss, by using the alien space. He said he would mobilize the entire army if I opened the gate, but that was a foolish display of judgment.</p>
<p>What would be the reason for me using the traditional principles of capitalism to overpower China and entice them into adopting it? If he were to take the next step and delve deeper into my motives for imposing capitalist rule upon the world, then he would realize that it would be inconceivable that I would allow him to throw millions of Chinese into the gate.</p>
<p>Yang Ga-Hye had not translated my words yet, but the Chinese leader looked devastated as if he understood me.</p>
<p>After the interpretation, the leader responded in an exhausted tone.</p>
<p>“He is asking if there would be any reason for the Chinese government to enter outer space on their own,” Yang Ga-Hye said.</p>
<p>I had already opened the way. As the IMF had fully opened the Chinese market, private companies in China were finding their way out. They could grow rapidly or collapse overnight depending on the authoritarian government’s powerful people.</p>
<p>“If the Chinese government itself focuses on growing the private market along with the support from the IMF, then more Chinese private companies will be bound to enter. However, the Chinese government wouldn’t be able to form its own military and advance there. This restriction is not just for China, but for all including my country and the United States.”</p>
<p>I wondered how the leader would take this remark. Since most of the capital focus was in my hands and even the Awakened were under my control, the leader could have thought I was full of greed to hog the world. Not only he, but the club members also would have thought the same thing and complained about it.</p>
<p>However, they would soon figure out if I was truly greedy over dominating outer space or not soon because I wouldn’t violate the internal guidelines. I had no desire to intervene in taking the profits from the extraterrestrial world.</p>
<p>The principle of “first come, first served” prevailed, regardless of whether the owner established a small town, grew into a powerful kingdom, or formed alliances on the land. My hope was that private companies and the Awakened would drive progress through their pursuit of wealth and human desires. I just paved the way for them to go in the right direction!</p>
<p>The entire earth was mine, so there was no reason for me to be greedy about the alien dimension. The war had not started yet, so even if the planet was much larger than earth… I was willing to give up anything to safeguard humanity and maintain the integrity of our land as it was previously. Even if they asked for my soul…</p>
<p>I added, “But the 3.5 trillion dollars has not been deposited yet. I hope that will be sorted out soon.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Similar to the Triangular Committee and Roman Club within the Jeonil Club, there existed a faction composed solely of knights from my financial empire.</p>
<p>Late at night when the leader returned to China without achieving his goals, a meeting of financial empires linking Wall Street and The City was held online. If this was Saint Dragorin, then there would have been a real throne and a place for monarchs. However, you only needed to plug in one LAN cable into a computer here.</p>
<p>When I told Gillian about the visit with the Chinese leader, he asked.</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: What would you do if the Chinese government selects a private company and forms a partnership?&gt;</p>
<p>Gillian was now in China with Kim Cheong-Soo. However, their backgrounds were different as they were staying in different hotels.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: I have no intention of sanctioning them that far.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: Movements similar to that are taking place in countries around the world.&gt;</p>
<p>A number of names were included in the data that Kim Cheong-Soo uploaded on the chat. It was evidence that he was constantly looking at the flow of the market although he was busy putting flags in the Chinese capital city and engulfing them. In that sense, the leader should have faced Kim Cheong-Soo and begged him instead of me.</p>
<p>Anyway, there were many names with MC (Military Company) and A (agency) on the document that Kim Cheong-Soo sent.</p>
<p>The two representative examples were Rothschild’s RMC (Rothschild Military Company) and CVA (Christ Victory Agency), which a Wall Street financier had established. On May 11th, the approval for entry into the financial space marked a significant milestone for these two companies.</p>
<p>The video programs we were using were designed to allow people to have online meetings.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo drew a red line connecting the dots he pointed.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: AGMC, TTA. Both of these companies were created with investment from the U.S.&gt;</p>
<p>In addition, names involving the British and Japanese governments were mentioned.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: But they are latecomers.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: …You knew about it.&gt;</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo reminded me of Jonathan in his prime, when he lived with bloodshot eyes. Despite having many subordinates who could assist him, he would have likely spent a significant amount of time managing them all and reaching his own conclusions.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was a distinct edge to his exhausted voice, which stemmed not only from the fact that he wasn’t Awakened. I could discern this from the fact that he probed into matters that I hadn’t asked for. He seemed cautious about the new market, and I suspected that I wasn’t the only one who felt that way.</p>
<p>&lt;Jessica: Brian, things are going as Odin wanted. You know that Chris’s CVA and Rothschild’s RMC are driving the global stock market, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: Is that because they are good? It’s only because Odin created the perfect environment for them. Also, the Rothschilds are a member of our club, but not Chris. Also, this is just between us, but I don’t trust Rothschild.&gt;</p>
<p>Gillian remained silent.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: So?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: I want to merge CVA and RMC.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Even though we would control the listed companies?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: Yes, we possess fifteen percent of CVA shares and thirteen percent of RMC. That’s how it is for now. It will take a lot more time to calculate the indirectly invested stake.&gt;</p>
<p>The first mercenary who returned was hired by the CVA, and one of their attack squads was leading the operation. The CVA-led craze was sweeping the global stock market.</p>
<p>As I always said, stories were more important than facts in the market. Even if the gold mine wasn’t developed and a new source wasn’t discovered immediately, the public still assumed that they would be pursued and invested without hesitation.</p>
<p>Moreover, it was a time when money was flowing into the stock market due to low-interest rates. The CVA was poised to garner additional investments and draw the attention of the Awakened who were keenly interested in private companies. As a result, the scale of its business would gradually expand over time. Therefore, Kim Cheong-Soo was suggesting that we swallow them before they got bigger.</p>
<p>&lt;Jessica: But, Brian…Rothschild is a member of our club, and Chris in CVA is credited. I understand what you are conscious of. However, have you not thought about how your words are going against Odin’s wishes? If our capital moves aggressively toward new markets, most start-ups will have no choice but to cower.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: This meeting is limited to capital markets that are getting out of our influence.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jessica: Do you really think so? The boundary was already broken after the Day of Advent, and although it may appear that they are currently distancing themselves from our influence, this may only be temporary. As for merging CVA and RMC, we need to be mindful of the limit to growth. If Odin approves, we can certainly bring their business to new heights in the next year or two. However, we must remember that a company is just a company, and we shouldn’t end up like China. We must exercise caution and not act impulsively, especially people like you who are currently in China.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: We are not entrepreneurs. We are financiers. If we see money, we should bring it to us.&gt;</p>
<p>Businessmen raised geese that laid golden eggs, but on Wall Street, there was a well-known saying that financiers would gut them at the first sign of wealth.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo was about to continue after rubbing his tired eyes, but then, Gillian finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: Please make a decision, Odin.&gt;</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo added.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: I hope you grant permission on mergers and acquisitions.&gt;</p>
<p>Jessica, on the other hand, didn’t speak and had an unwavering look on her face. She was well aware of my intention to thrive in private military enterprises and agencies. I didn’t give the approval, and the next agenda was about issues related to the Chinese market opening.</p>
<p>After the video conference, I contacted Kim Cheong-Soo separately.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: I wasn’t thinking straight.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: How many years have you been working with Jessica?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: Ten years.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: That’s long enough for you to grasp her meaning.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: …But she was particularly aggressive.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Yes, she shouldn’t have been like a girl in adolescence. You put up with it well.&gt;</p>
<p>Even a genius was bound to show weakness at one point if they became emotional.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: I heard there was internal data leaked from Carl and Jane’s Accounting Law Firm. Jessica has access to it. I want you to keep your distance from her.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: I will look into it by myself.&gt;</p>
<p>It was too early to be disappointed because nothing had been revealed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 362</p>
<p>Jessica came into the living room after checking the stock price of the CVA (Chris Victory Agency), then she soon regretted it.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have protected them like that.</p>
<p>No, she was right in protecting the group, but the way she did it was wrong. Even if she hadn’t stepped up, Odin would not have allowed the merger and acquisition.</p>
<p>Her husband, Gillian, kept calling her, but she didn’t answer. She had turned her phone on mute as she expected this would happen.</p>
<p>As Jessica was deep in thought with her hand resting on her forehead, she was interrupted by a female voice.</p>
<p>“Are you not going to answer?”</p>
<p>The person asking was Lucy, an Awakened Jessica had hired as a residential security guard. She had noticed a clear disparity in skill level among the Awakened, prompting her to seek assistance from the higher section.</p>
<p>Despite this, she couldn’t shake the feeling that bringing such an individual to her place was not quite right for her. Moreover, the Awakened in the high section were those who had led a group in the Stage of Advent. It was paradoxical, but they tended to miss those times a lot.</p>
<p>What Jessica despised most were their condescending gazes toward those who they considered beneath them. Although some were adept at concealing their true intentions behind courteous manners, she couldn’t help but penetrate through their veiled expressions because she was once like that before.</p>
<p>She was extremely sensitive and arrogant now, particularly due to the fact that a seemingly unimportant Wall Street figure had achieved enough success to dominate the global economy and marry her husband.</p>
<p>Therefore, she went through multiple interviews and employed Lucy. Lucy had a more subdued gaze compared to those from higher sections, as she was in the Bsilgol section. Although she had been through hell, she was clumsy and foolish enough that Jessica could grasp her thoughts. The purpose of the hiring was to make rumors spread in the industry that she had hired Awakened as a bodyguard, so there was no concern about choosing Lucy.</p>
<p>Lucy pointed out, “You keep getting calls.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>When she didn’t answer the phone call, Gillian sent her a follow-up text.</p>
<p>「 Why did you do that? Pick up the phone. 」</p>
<p>Jessica powered down her personal phone while keeping her other phone designated for business purposes on.</p>
<p>“You look different today,” Lucy said.</p>
<p>Jessica asked, “Even you can tell that, right? But why didn’t you leave for outer space? Do you want me to introduce you to an agency?”</p>
<p>“Then who will guard you, Jessica?”</p>
<p>Jessica blinked. “You seem very different from other Awakened. Umm… You seem relaxed.”</p>
<p>Lucy smiled quietly. Perhaps she had caught Jessica’s attention with her tranquil expression. Jessica beckoned to sit next to her instead of standing like that.</p>
<p>Jessica had many bodyguards, but her Awakened bodyguard was definitely different. Lucy sat down without hesitation, and Jessica looked at her with envious eyes. Well, of course, except for the hell she went through.</p>
<p>“Should we take a shot, Lucy?”</p>
<p>Lucy accepted her suggestion this time because she knew she wasn’t there to guard her. However, it was Jessica who hesitated when Lucy poured whiskey into her glass as she hadn’t even sipped a drop of alcohol in several years.</p>
<p>Lucy glanced at Jessica’s quivering eyes as she looked at the glass, and then pushed the glass close to her.</p>
<p>Lucy said to Jessica with a slightly playful tone, “You’re the one who first suggested that we drink.”</p>
<p>“Teach me how you can smile like that even though you have been through hell. You… You are…”</p>
<p>Jessica refrained from asking how Lucy managed to remain composed despite being in the Bsilgol section.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You are living in such a magnificent mansion.”</p>
<p>Lucy was actually curious. At first, she didn’t know who was employing her. She just thought it would be one of the rich, but that wasn’t true. In terms of the civilian world, Jessica was the most influential and richest woman in the world.</p>
<p>If Lucy hadn’t become a bodyguard, then she would have never been able to see Jessica.</p>
<p>Then, Jessica asked, “You don’t have kids, do you?”</p>
<p>Only then did Lucy realize that she had never seen a picture of a child in the mansion.</p>
<p>Lucy replied, “No, I don’t.”</p>
<p>Jessica stated somewhat bitterly, “We dedicated a lot of effort towards having a child, even undergoing procedures. Perhaps, God believes that we already had enough blessings.”</p>
<p>G…god?</p>
<p>Lucy was rolling her eyes inward cynically.</p>
<p>If there was a god, there would be no place like the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>If there were a being recognized as a deity, then Lucy would say that she had witnessed such an entity in the Final Stage.</p>
<p>Anyway, Lucy realized Jessica was acting like she was in vain even though she had everything except for a child.</p>
<p>“That is why I’m estranged from my husband. We have so many conflicts with our opinions. Come to think of it, you have never seen him, have you?” Jessica asked.</p>
<p>She was talking about Gillian, the CEO of Gillian Investment Finance Group. Lucy answered that she had not.</p>
<p>“It’s your turn, Lucy.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Are you going to pretend that you know nothing?”</p>
<p>Lucy smiled in a way that Jessica envied again, then she said slowly, “You will have a smile like mine once you have a child. That’s the only thing you feel like you are missing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you have everything?” Jessica asked curiously.</p>
<p>Lucy shrugged. “Not as much as you, Jessica, but I have a lot of things. Of course, I don’t want a kid.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jessica was lying on the bed.</p>
<p>“You will have a smile like mine once you have a child. That’s the only thing you feel like you are missing, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Lucy’s voice kept ringing in Jessica’s ears. These were thoughts that she was already aware of, but hearing the confirmation from someone else felt like a sharp blade piercing her lungs. She desperately wanted a kid with her own eyes and her husband’s hair color, but it was too late.</p>
<p>Both she and her husband were too old. Individuals who had already attained success and still had the potential for further achievements tended to forget their age and concentrate only on their goals. However, she solely gazed at the summit. Looking back, she didn’t let go of the hope of having a child when she disclosed Mossack Fonseca, the Panama tax avoidance factory.</p>
<p>That must be why I did such a thing.</p>
<p>As she ascended to the pinnacle and looked down, she realized that the world was terrible. She discovered what she had done under Odin, and she didn’t want her kids to grow up in that world where the fate of billions of people hinged on the judgment of a single authoritative individual. Especially in situations where the propensity of the absolute could not be distinguished by good or evil.</p>
<p>Did a good end justify any and all means employed in achieving it? And conversely, how should one judge a situation where the means employed were good, but the end pursued was evil?</p>
<p>Also, as long as the person with power wasn’t a robot, that tendency could always change from evil to good and vice versa.</p>
<p>Apart from such a philosophical problem, the world crafted by absolute authority had surpassed even the dystopian setting depicted in the book [1984]. Nevertheless, the authority held only economic power, lacking physical force until that point.</p>
<p>However, he shouldn’t have touched the Carl and Jane Accounting Law Firm! That was a detonator! Jessica couldn’t have kids and didn’t even think about adoption, but that was the last straw for her.</p>
<p>She groped around the floor in the darkness, then swallowed a pill of Moclobemide with a sip of water. She knew that taking antidepressants wouldn’t help because the world wouldn’t change because of a few pills.</p>
<p>“What is wrong with you? Jessica. Is it just because of kids?”</p>
<p>She felt like she could hear her husband scolding her.</p>
<p>“Yes! Only because of that!”</p>
<p>Her shouting at him also rang in her ears.</p>
<p>Jessica was sobbing without realizing it. She had heard that the Stage of Advent was akin to hell, but she had also been enduring a living hell for the past several years. She couldn’t discern whether her inability to conceive or the terror induced by the world shaped by absolute authority was the source of her turmoil.</p>
<p>She seemed to have cried herself to sleep because her pillow was wet when she woke up.</p>
<p>“Are you okay? I was debating if I should wake you up or not.”</p>
<p>It was Lucy. Jessica was in a bad mood. She had forgotten about her nightmare, yet the lingering sentiment of weeping persisted within her. At that moment, Lucy’s attention shifted toward the medicine case on the floor.</p>
<p>Lucy said as if taking antidepressants was nothing, “Jessica, this won’t help you at all.”</p>
<p>“How did you go through the Stage of Advent, Lucy?” Jessica suddenly asked.</p>
<p>Lucy shrugged. “I drank monster blood sometimes.”</p>
<p>“Monster blood?” Jessica widened her eyes.</p>
<p>Lucy’s lips quirked. “But the effect was only temporary. This is the pill I brought from the United States.”</p>
<p>Lucy took out a red pill from her jacket.</p>
<p>“Don’t even talk about it if it’s an addictive drug.” There was a distinct edge to Jessica’s voice.</p>
<p>“A drug?” Lucy laughed it off.</p>
<p>“This is the only one left, so what should I do?” Lucy said with a sweet smile as if she was talking to her old friend while waving her hand that held the pill.</p>
<p>She continued, “Give it a try. The pill itself isn’t addictive, and I’m sure you will feel less depressed. It’s not something that causes hallucinations. This isn’t a drug. It’s beyond that.”</p>
<p>Jessica narrowed her eyes. “What’s inside that pill?”</p>
<p>“You will find out when you take it. This is my gift to you for being kind to me. This is so hard to get, and if you like it, you could get some more? I will pay for them. Nothing is impossible for you, right?”</p>
<p>Jessica recalled a scene from the movie [Matrix] as she looked at the pill in Lucy’s hand. In the movie, the pill was a medicine that told the world the truth.</p>
<p>I already know the truth.</p>
<p>Jessica smirked and picked up the pill, then swallowed it with a cup of water that she didn’t finish last night. She had taken stimulants multiple times before, and she thought the pill would be one of them.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the pill hit her stomach…</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>She could sense the presence of the pill in her stomach. Then, she distinctly felt the effects spreading throughout her body like a spiderweb, even reaching all of her blood vessels.</p>
<p>Lucy said as if she had been waiting until Jessica widened her eyes, “That drug is called Spider-Web. Don’t you get why it’s named like that? I heard it’s more effective for civilians.”</p>
<p>Jessica found it difficult to describe the efficacy of the pill. It provided more energy than any stimulant and, as Lucy had claimed, completely eradicated any melancholic emotions she had been experiencing as though they had never existed in the first place.</p>
<p>When Jessica tried to get up from the bed using one hand for support, the bed couldn’t withstand the force exerted by her. The bed suddenly collapsed, causing her to lose her balance. Although she was expected to tumble with the bed, her reflexes enabled her to regain stability, which was a skill that the average civilian would not possess.</p>
<p>“I knew it, but I guess you really don’t socialize with anyone. Isn’t it hard to just work?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>“There’s a trend among the rich women to secretly call Bsilgol men over after taking the pill.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>Lucy snorted. “Come on. What other reason is there for a woman to call a man secretly?”</p>
<p>However, Jessica actually didn’t know what she meant. A wave of energy unlike any she had ever experienced before hit her, and it was a recollection of searching for new companies, driven by her pursuit of changing markets.</p>
<p>She didn’t only look for private military companies and agencies like Brian Kim. The research of inventing new medications from monster carcasses and blood was underway in the pharmaceutical industry, and one company sponsored by the U.S. government grabbed her attention.</p>
<p>“Lucy! Is this synthesized from the monster’s blood?” she asked.</p>
<p>Jessica opened her laptop instead of listening to Lucy’s reply. She tracked the relevant information on the spot.</p>
<p>I found it.</p>
<p>A new drug was on the verge of being released by a pharmaceutical company sponsored by the U.S. government. They were listed by a financial firm and, unsurprisingly, were one of the companies under Jeonil.</p>
<p>The equity structure of the pharmaceutical companies was simple. Twenty percent were equally distributed to each of the three corporations and one individual investor running the company. The remaining twenty percent was left out for sponsorship and listing in the future.</p>
<p>What stood out was the assumption that the two corporations belonged to the absolute ruler. If this were true, then the pharmaceutical company’s true owner would be Odin, since even firms believed to be funded by the U.S. government were subject to his influence.</p>
<p>Right, the world has been like that for a long time.</p>
<p>Even now, there were many elites in the world who were active without knowing who was at their top and whose money they were dealing with. They might be proud to think that they were smarter than anyone else, but they didn’t know who they were working for. The shares of pharmaceutical companies secured by the absolute were the result of such blind elites’ hard work.</p>
<p>Jessica had been helping Odin to build the system, so she could see through the situation quickly. Brian Kim was impatient to acquire RMC of Rothschild and CVA of Chris, but Jessica still didn’t think that was a smart suggestion.</p>
<p>If you look into the equity structures of the company, it might turn out to be the property of Odin.</p>
<p>She was confident that the absolute wouldn’t be able to fully grasp his property. It was meaningless and impossible. He probably only knew that he had dominated the Earth. The Earth belonged to him, and the same applied to anything that originated from it.</p>
<p>Jessica got up from her seat. The world was still the same even though she looked at it with eyes full of vitality. However, she wasn’t depressed anymore due to the pill.</p>
<p>This is…</p>
<p>It was an undeniable truth that Odin had saved mankind from the Day of Advent. However, his presence and the order he had entrenched during the process were extremely dangerous.</p>
<p>Jessica sat down again after checking that Lucy was out in the living room. Then, she put her hands on the keyboard. She appeared determined as she contacted the person through the encrypted channel.</p>
<p>&lt;A: Is the weather nice?&gt;</p>
<p>She wanted the public to realize the truth of the world.</p>

<p>2018.05.29 : KRW 28,600</p>
<p>Net change/↑ KRW 6,600 + 30.00% 」</p>
<p>As of today, June 1st, the agency of Daehyun Group has been consistently reaching the upper limit for the past three days. Furthermore, the fall of the Franklin Dukedom resulted in an increased focus on entry into the Land of Whirlpool, causing related stock prices to surge.</p>
<p>With the June 10th deadline fast approaching for Doom Kaos, Joshua was under pressure to produce results, particularly given the unexpected challenge posed by Jonathan’s inability to adjust to his return. This had caused him to wander aimlessly.</p>
<p>At that time, the sound of footsteps got closer and someone knocked on the door. It was Lee Tae-Han.</p>
<p>“The girl is not someone who would say nonsense.”</p>
<p>He was talking about Lucy, the girl he sent as Jessica’s residential bodyguard. After Jessica’s conversion was confirmed, the association left a separate job for that girl. They ordered her to find out the path of the crypto channel where Jessica was leaking information.</p>
<p>Lucy sent everything without knowing the nature of the data being shared, including a private chat network that was used between financiers like Jessica. While the data contained various miscellaneous information, it also included the specific item that we had been searching for.</p>
<p>As a result, Bastian, a reporter for the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists, was apprehended by the association’s security team, as he met Lee Tae-Han, whom he believed to be Jessica.</p>
<p>“What about him?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It cost a bit to deal with him. May I tell you my opinion?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>“We are sending security agents to him.”</p>
<p>While he clearly wanted to kill Bastian, such an act would have presented complications. The last thing I wanted was for Jessica to discover that I had made contact with them. Ultimately, there was something much more important at stake than the life of a surveillance journalist like Bastian, who had sold out his principles for a mere ten million dollars.</p>
<p>The next day, I received a call that Gillian’s private plane had arrived at Incheon Airport while I was putting together the information that was brought back by returned mercenaries from the Franklin Duchy and the Land of Whirlpool. However, he didn’t immediately return to the association as I had ordered him to come in on time with his wife.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gillian had a hunch that Odin would call him upon realizing that Brian Kim’s associates had not only ransacked Mossack Fonseca but also the Carl and Jane Accounting Law Firm. He had a feeling that the data that was obtained through their internal source was aimed at Jessica. That was why they were here today.</p>
<p>He had made every effort to contact his wife but ultimately failed. He actually entrusted his Chinese work to his elite subordinates and flew to the Isle of Man where his wife lived. However, her bodyguards stood in front and didn’t let him in. She didn’t respond to any phone calls or texts. For reasons that were entirely unknown, she had retreated into a cave and was evidently undergoing a process of self-destruction.</p>
<p><em>So why the hell? Jessica!</em></p>
<p>He knew she was suffering from severe depression. Nevertheless, the sense of accomplishment he had gained by protecting the market on the Day of Advent was immense, so he thought Jessica would feel the same way and recover to a certain level.</p>
<p><em>We saved billions of people in the world.</em></p>
<p>No… He believed she would be completely cured of the depression from that alone.</p>
<p>However, he noticed that his wife had remained the same at this year’s club meeting. While she put on a smile and engaged with other members, he could detect that she was still struggling with depression. This was evidenced by her avoidance of him and the occasional shadow that fell across her face. He should have held on to her then as that had clearly been the last chance.</p>
<p>Gillian gazed out the car window, which was heavily tinted and made even the midday appear dark, much like the overwhelming sense of heartbreak that he was experiencing.</p>
<p>The secretary said when Gillian lowered his window, “She just got here!”</p>
<p>“Jessica?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>Jessica followed Odin’s instructions and arrived in Korea promptly. Gillian caught sight of her walking alongside her bodyguards from afar.</p>
<p>“Can I take the ride with you?” she asked.</p>
<p>Gillian opened the door for her, then moved closer to her side.</p>
<p>“Why are you looking at me with such surprised eyes? Did you think I would ignore his order?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Not that. I didn’t expect you would ask for a ride together.”</p>
<p>She responded, “This is the last time.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“It’s none of your concern. I will ensure that nothing happens to you. That’s why I’m here,” she reassured him.</p>
<p>“Yes. You have to make sure I’m not removed from his line.”</p>
<p>Gillian felt a throbbing headache and rubbed his forehead with the thick part of his palm.</p>
<p>“Do you have a headache?” she asked.</p>
<p>He nodded morosely. “Yes. How could we fill your spot? Who can replace you?”</p>
<p>“Are you not worried about me?”</p>
<p>“You’ve always been like this. Your thoughts are often too complex for me to understand, and it is no different this time. I have absolutely no idea what you are thinking…”</p>
<p>Gillian felt like he would become emotional if he spoke any more. It was too early to shed tears. In order to protect Jessica in front of him, he needed to grasp her intention first.</p>
<p>As the car began to move. Gillian realized that the time until they reached the association headquarters could be his final moment with his wife. He gazed at Jessica with a complex expression in his eyes, unable to bear the weight of his emotions. The intensity of his feelings was akin to the swirls of emotions that the four priests had evoked during the ceremony.</p>
<p><em>Worry.</em></p>
<p>According to the Awakened, Odin was a ruthless man in the Stage of Advent. Many strong Awakened had tried to assassinate his lover Mary in the Final Stage, but they all died without mercy. He never showed forgiveness to those who conspired behind his back even before the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>His wife…could die with the love, friendship, and respect she shared with Gillian.</p>
<p><em>Rage.</em></p>
<p><em>Why do you think the current civilization is still intact and maintained? How was the world saved?</em></p>
<p>The memory of Odin explaining why he had been named after a god had remained etched in Gillian’s mind.</p>
<p>“<em>I hope you are prepared to save the world. If that proves to be too difficult, then take a moment to reflect on what we have accomplished so far. We have always managed to thrive during times of global economic crisis, and the upcoming crisis…it could very well be the worst one. But we are already getting ready for it.”</em></p>
<p>Odin was driven by a noble purpose, rather than greed. Moreover, he had never taken any actions that contravened this purpose, both before and after entering the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>His actions were entirely focused on ensuring the stability and well-being of humanity. When the suggestion was made at this year’s club meeting to revive Project Tessera and install wiretapping devices in all of humanity, Odin immediately dismissed it. Instead, he restricted it to the Awakened, a source of anxiety within society. This was a prime example of his righteousness.</p>
<p>His wisdom lay in the creation of a financial empire that was instrumental in defending the Day of Advent, as well as his wise management of the Awakened following the Day of Advent. Despite being the wealthiest person in human history, he didn’t spend the money on himself. Instead, his decade-long focus on the dungeons prior to entering the Stage of Advent was a testament to his moderation.</p>
<p>While he was fearful of the potential collapse of civilization on the Day of Advent, he was unafraid to take on the old Bilderberg Club. This demonstrated his courage in understanding what to fear and what not to fear.</p>
<p>Odin embodied the characteristic of a Philosopher King[1], as described in Plato’s ideals. Also, this world paralleled the utopian society envisioned by Plato’s concept of a Philosopher King ruler.</p>
<p>However, his wife Jessica turned her back on a world she would never see again. Gillian still couldn’t understand why. It was unacceptable for any reason!</p>
<p><em>Self-reproach.</em></p>
<p>He should have taken care of his wife. He had to do the same as his wife had taken care of him in the days when he was wandering without being able to hold his mind together. Every time the procedure failed, he at least needed to try to understand her feelings. Although it was urgent to prevent the destruction of mankind, he should have focused on her well-being.</p>
<p>Jessica was such a competent financier that he completely forgot that she was also his woman. However, it was too late.</p>
<p>1. A ruler who possesses both a love of wisdom and a desire to live a just life and is, therefore, best suited to govern society. ☜</p>

<p>Jessica was such a competent financier that he completely forgot that she was also his woman. However, it was too late.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jessica kept silent until they almost reached the headquarters.</p>
<p>“Please.”</p>
<p>Gillian burst into screams as he buried his head in Jessica’s lap.</p>
<p>“It’s funny to say it myself. I know you better than anyone else, and you won’t be able to stand it.”</p>
<p>“I promise,” his voice shook.</p>
<p>“You used to think like me, that the Jeonil Club is dangerous. Isn’t that very contradictory? Now I’m doing that, and you are loyal to them. Yes, I didn’t want to raise a kid in this world.”</p>
<p><em>So everything comes back to kids again?</em></p>
<p>Gillian almost screamed. He closed his eyes so tightly that tears inadvertently fell out.</p>
<p>“No… No…”</p>
<p>Gillian continued to mutter, rubbing his face against Jessica’s lap. As Gillian’s movement became more intense, Jessica watched his trembling fist from behind his head and spoke in a hollow voice, “I told you that you won’t be able to stand it.”</p>
<p>He wailed, “Even I can’t forgive you for that reason. Jessica…You are done.”</p>
<p>“Raise your head. Come on.”</p>
<p>Tears were flowing from Gillian’s bloodshot eyes. Jessica could tell that he was incredibly angry.</p>
<p>“I admire you, and I respect Odin more than you.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“But it was something that one of us had to do. Jonathan? Joshua? Brian? And you? Who would have done it except me? I was the only one.”</p>
<p>“Was your plan simply to leak data? Such a woman like you? Nothing else but just a disclosure?”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “Then what more can I do? I don’t mean to break order and don’t have the ability to do so.”</p>
<p>“Then what is this for…”</p>
<p>“I wanted to incite fear in Odin with public sentiment so that he would return to the right path even if he was straying.”</p>
<p>“That’s ridiculous!”</p>
<p>Gillian pounded the private screen blocking the driver and back seat. “Turn the car around! Right now! What the fuck are you doing! I said turn the car right now!”</p>
<p>“Where should I take you then?” the driver asked.</p>
<p>He screeched, “Anywhere! Anywhere far from the association’s headquarters!”</p>
<p>The driver widened his eyes as this was his first time witnessing Gillian acting in such an aggressive manner.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Are you insane?” Jessica yelled at Gillian.</p>
<p>He responded tersely, “He will forgive me.”</p>
<p>Jessica looked at Gillian with shaky eyes, but only for a short moment.</p>
<p>She then said to the driver, “Please go to the association headquarters and just ignore him. Our boss is calling for us. If you turn the car around, you will have to be responsible for that.”</p>
<p>“But President…” the driver said.</p>
<p>“Turn the car!” she ordered.</p>
<p>Gilian pleaded, “I’m telling you. They won’t deal with this by just firing you. You would never have seen him so furious. Think wisely about what kind of situation you are in.”</p>
<p>He then turned to the driver, “Turn the fucking car around!”</p>
<p>Jessica interrupted, “If you do that, you will be in big trouble. Just go. That’s how we will save Gillian instead.”</p>
<p>As soon as the car turned around, Jessica shifted her gaze toward Gillian from the driver’s head.</p>
<p>“Wow, he is as loyal as you are. So what are you going to do now?”</p>
<p>“Think about it. You are better than me.”</p>
<p>“Why don’t we head to Odin’s parent’s house and ask for a meal?”</p>
<p>“...Okay.”</p>
<p>“You are definitely out of your mind. What I did isn’t something to ask for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“Now I understand the emotions that led you to this moment.”</p>
<p>“Are you treating me like a patient now? You are too full of rage right now.”</p>
<p>“It’s all because of you, Jessica.”</p>
<p>Jessica sighed. “I don’t want you to be harmed because of me.”</p>
<p>“Then you shouldn’t have made things like this. Did you not expect that I would act like this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Did you know?” she asked in response.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I didn’t, but you should have. This is what you did.”</p>
<p>Jessica frowned. “What do you mean? But are you really doing this for me? There will be consequences.”</p>
<p>Gillian continued, “I will regret it, but yes. Take a moment to reconsider why you believed this world to be dangerous. If we have children, then they will grow up safer than any other child… Be selfish.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “We don’t even have one.”</p>
<p>He insisted, “Just think about it.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “Then I hope they can grow up normally in a world that is itself normal.”</p>
<p>“The world ruled by the Bilderberg Club? No, in a world where human civilization has collapsed, so people are wearing rags and are scrounging for food? That was our kids’ future if he wasn’t here. You are not the only one who wanted to have children. I did too. I still do.”</p>
<p>Jessica fell silent as Gillian’s tears began to flow endlessly. “Never mind. It’s all useless now. Odin will never forgive you…and me.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “It’s not too late. I understand you, so let’s go back to the headquarters.”</p>
<p>“Do you still love me?” Gillian raised his head and looked at Jessica.</p>
<p>“...I now know what you needed.”</p>
<p>Gillain begged, “Stop saying nonsense. Please just plead for forgiveness. If not for yourself, then for me. Just tell them that you were crazy for a bit because of the depression. I don’t want to lose you.”</p>
<p>Jessica looked at Gillian trembling for a while, then she pulled Gillian’s neck toward her chest and opened the blocked private screen.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry for changing our minds, but please drop us off at the headquarters.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Despite Jessica’s conversion being purely driven by her conscience and not for engaging with other club members or personal gain, her betrayal was still a shock to me. I was honestly impressed upon realizing her intention through Bastian.</p>
<p>Did any of the whistleblowers hold a position as high as Jessica did? No. They were usually from lower groups who accidentally came into contact with top secrets. None of the top leaders were directly involved in this matter like she was.</p>
<p>Above all, she was currently holding the position. One of the richest and most prestigious people in the world disclosed the club’s information. Furthermore, she would have known the hell I had gone through during the Stage of Advent, so it was a life-threatening risk for Jessica to even touch the Carl and Jane Accounting Law Firm.</p>
<p>No one survived after betraying me. In that sense, Jessica would be the only one who would stay alive although she had turned her back on me. It was because she gave up on her vested rights and acted according to her conscience, rather than trying to protect her wealth.</p>
<p>According to Basitan’s statement, Jessica was fully prepared for the press conference and willing to sacrifice everything she had gained.</p>
<p>Therefore, I contemplated what led her to this point, as it wasn’t her desire for wealth, status, or fame. Conscientious whistle-blowing… Perhaps Jessica thought that the threat to humanity had been eliminated, but afterward, she may have become fearful of me, who had amassed vast wealth, power and military might and the state of the world at the moment.</p>
<p>One thing that was evident was her significant contribution to the financial empire. If I left for outer space, then she was one of the three individuals responsible for maintaining order in my absence. In the world of business, I could forcibly squeeze Daniel from Gold and Silver into the Big Four, but he wasn’t comparable to Brian Kim, Gillian, and Jessica.</p>
<p>A rule had been already established in this world, so we had to keep it as it was. There was no other option than to acknowledge the importance of Jessica’s role. Even though I could take on the responsibilities of those I killed in the Stage of Advent, there were certain areas that only Jessica could handle and no one else could replace her.</p>
<p>That was why. I was going to tell her about it so that she could make a wise judgment when she arrived. I was planning to explain which position we were in and what kind of contract I signed with Doom Kaos to hold her. I could put aside anger and disappointment if she accepted those terms to stay.</p>
<p>However, Jessica’s first words were as unexpected as her conversion.</p>
<p>“How…can I make it up to you and earn your forgiveness?”</p>
<p>Another unexpected thing was the sound of her heart.</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>A sound of another heart tickled my ears.</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>I commented, “It must have been around six weeks.”</p>
<p>“...Pardon me?” she asked, frowning.</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze toward Gillian and said, “Have you named your kid?”</p>
<p>Gillian had the same reaction as if he had heard nothing from Jessica. They looked at each other in surprise. I decided to stop talking about it and tell not only Jessica but also Gillian the truth of the world that the four priests knew.</p>
<p>However, my nerves became on edge with the feeling of someone pulling my hair. From there, the pressure spread to my entire body and gently pressed down on me. It was a familiar phenomenon.</p>
<p>I made a gesture to stop Jessica as she was trying to say something, then focused on the voice that would fill the space soon.</p>

<p>I couldn’t determine the source or origin of this pressure, but it was undoubtedly emanating from a specific point in time and space. Suddenly and inexplicably, it surged through my body like an item being extracted from my storage.</p>
<p><strong>[You have gained 20 points on Power.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Power: 320]</strong></p>
<p>The pressure seemed to be scratching my chest wall with their claws to get them out.</p>
<p><em>Swoosh!</em></p>
<p>The sensation of energy pouring into my body made my eyes widen even further, and I suddenly knew what I had to do. Unlike a rainbow bridge or a red carpet, the driveway leading to the extraterrestrial world was a set of coordinates. I realized that the spot where Joshua had defeated the Holy Knight was likely where I needed to open the gateway.</p>
<p>Without further delay, I wanted to check Joshua’s situation first.</p>
<p><strong>[You have used Gate Formation.]</strong></p>
<p>As the air tore apart like a reptile’s pupil, Joshua burst in holding his bloody abdomen, and stumbled, causing a handful of blood to spill on Jessica’s stiffened body and dress.</p>
<p>Joshua looked back at me and said, “P…please…close…it Before…before that…that thing.. comes in...”</p>
<p>1. A ruler who possesses both a love of wisdom and a desire to live a just life and is, therefore, best suited to govern society. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 364</p>
<p>There was no doubt that they were facing a time crunch. The distance between the Land of Whirlpool and the Franklin Dukedom, where Yeon-Hee was located, wasn’t very far. Since there was an enemy that Joshua and his attack squad couldn’t deal with, I had to intervene.</p>
<p><em>Tat!</em></p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Zeus’s Thunder Spear has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Ra’s Sun Cape has been removed.]</p>
<p>This was along with the other A-class items I had taken from Cat Food Warehouse!</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Wrath.]</p>
<p>[Target: Zeus’s Thunder Spear]</p>
<p>A vigorous power wrapped around my chest, back, and hands. At the same time, I propelled myself towards the varied sensation at the edge of time and space, into another dimension, diving head first.</p>
<p>As the gate shut, the radiance emitted by the LED lights in the room dimmed. Suddenly, the expanse of outer space unfolded before me, expanding and unfurling all at once. The vast area was saturated with green clouds, and I could even see the backs and sides of those who were fleeing.</p>
<p>When I felt a squishy sensation underfoot and looked down, I noticed a lifeless body on the ground. The individual’s eyes were open wide as though they were still in disbelief that he had died. His face was not only affected by the plague, but also coated in thick green mucus. Also, most of his limbs were gone as they had been chopped off by sharp objects, and there was a palm mark on his neck as if it was held by a strong force.</p>
<p>It appeared that Joshua had taken his life while restraining him with his summoned object. The hole in the body’s chest was just large enough for an adult’s hand to pass through, and it seemed he had died when his heart was either compressed or squeezed. Blood, broken pieces of ribs, and fluid were sticking out of the hole.</p>
<p>This body was the remains of Holy Knight Caldoran.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, my body was impatient to activate the Man Who Overcomes Adversity as soon as I entered the space. Just as white blood cells worked, my body recognized the plague in the air as enemies.</p>
<p>[The Man Who Overcomes Adversity has been activated.]</p>
<p>Upon entering, I immediately noticed a pair of strikingly red eyes glaring at me through the green clouds. That individual stood atop a heap of corpses and seemed to have just charged forward as the gust that accompanied him dispersed the verdant haze around him.</p>
<p>I now was able to see him better. He was definitely staring at me with a pair of eyes that reminded me of a hell gate that was situated in a pit of fire. He was around my height, and his hair was as red as his eyes. His face was sharp, and the longer he stared at me, the more prominent the blood vessels that were engraved on his forehead appeared.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, he was filled with fury. However, he appeared to have the same hesitation as I did, leading us to stare at each other with the sense that we were the same kind, the strongest of the strong. The only difference was that he was mad while I was just suspicious. Although he appeared to be a human, he definitely wasn't.</p>
<p>The child in Jessica’s womb had a rapid, yet feeble pulse that was noticeably distinct from the typical cardiac rhythms of humans. Similarly, this man’s heart didn’t beat like that of an ordinary person. Also, it didn’t beat as rapidly as Jessica’s unborn child or our kind, the Awakened.</p>
<p>At first, I wondered whether his heart had ceased beating, leading me to consider the possibility that he was akin to ghouls, despite his outwardly pristine appearance. However, my suspicion was put to rest when his heart finally began to pulsate.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>His heartbeat was indeed slow, but once it began pounding, it circulated blood all over his body with unbelievable pressure. His heart was moving like a bell that only rang once in a year.</p>
<p>He wasn’t an ordinary alien. Rather, he was simply donning the exterior of one as a disguise! Fortunately, he was alone. If there was another guy like him, then I instinctively knew that it would have been hard for me to confront them.</p>
<p>Since I was in an unknown region of space, my familiarity with the surroundings was limited. Therefore, I made the choice to exert all my strength by utilizing Odin’s Golden Armor to bolster my lightning bolts, rather than creating the Absolute Warzone.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Storm).]</p>
<p>[‘Odin’s Wrath’ has been transformed into ‘Odin’s Thunderstorm.’]</p>
<p>A tempestuous thunderstorm, accompanied by frenzied bolts of lightning, began to take shape from within the core of my body. The pestilent mist, which had been obscuring my sight with a green glow, and the fused clusters of melted plague particles flew together. The particles around me turned into a thick fog and flew in all directions. A considerable amount of them flew toward him.</p>
<p>The protruding blood vessels on his forehead undulated vigorously as if it was attempting to detect any signs of parasites coursing through them. He rapidly acted, raising a shield and unleashing an explosion simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, the force didn’t pour into me. Instead, scarlet beams shot up from his head towards the sky, creating a domed barrier that enveloped his surroundings. It was similar to my Absolute Warzone. He was faced with a life-or-death choice. If he completed the barrier before me, then he would safeguard a portion of the world that would otherwise be ravaged by our battle.</p>
<p>This was my first time facing this guy, but his gaze was filled with the long-cherished desire to kill me and vigilance. His boundary was completed in a very short time. Did he do it because he didn’t want to be disturbed by others? Or was it because he judged that narrowing the space for us to fight was more advantageous for him?</p>
<p>The boundary was merely a few paces behind me, yet I refused to remain still once it materialized. My relentless attacks hurled towards him as the lightning spear that tore through the void towards his position.</p>
<p><em>Zing!</em></p>
<p>Then, I used Indra’s Sword.</p>
<p><em>Bziiiing!</em></p>
<p>As the electric energy surged in a straight line, carried by unruly winds, Indra’s Sword coiled around the straight beam of lightning power, preparing for a simultaneous assault. Indra’s Sword sped up and rushed towards him. In case he was able to control the space like the Guide did in the Final Stage, I focused on the flow of the space around me.</p>
<p>Despite the immense power of the lightning strike, I could only sense the surge of energy, while he remained rooted in place.</p>
<p><em>Nice.</em></p>
<p>He was a beat behind. He released unusually strong energy because he definitely thought it was too late to avoid my attacks. He created a clutter of flames, united by the cosmos-destroying conflagration at the close of a kalpa[1]. It coursed into my attacks and threw flames in advance.</p>
<p>The fiery sphere collided with my lightning in front of him, causing the bolts of lightning power to shatter and fuse into his own flames. Despite this, Indra’s Blade endured until the end, piercing through the inferno and impaling the guy.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>In a manner reminiscent of Shiva’s Sword, his fireball detonated, unleashing a surge of heat and shockwaves that stirred up a feverish commotion within the boundary. Fragments of the ruptured earth were flung in every direction.</p>
<p>He showed up faster than they did as his face zoomed into my vision out of nowhere. Indra’s Sword was still stuck in him, but his face was filled with more rage than pain. He was definitely trying to narrow the distance between us. I didn’t know how confident he was, but I had no intention to dance to his tune.</p>
<p>As I shot up from the ground, he followed. At that moment, the pieces of flames that were torn apart were scattered into the air.</p>
<p><em>Sheeeek-!</em></p>
<p>I thrust my spear towards his face, but it was the lightning energy discharged from the weapon that made contact with him, rather than the spearhead itself, as he had altered his trajectory in mid-flight.</p>
<p>He might have thought he had escaped the attack, but the real assault was just beginning. The focal point was the very tip of my spear, where the force of Odin’s Thunderstorm was concentrated! Rather than resembling a natural thunderstorm, the lightning energy erupted from the tip of the spear, writhing like a handful of vicious raptors.</p>
<p>This was the most powerful attack when Zeus’s Thunder Spear and Odin’s Thunderstorm were combined. Of course, he couldn’t avoid it. Even if he tried, there was no space left to avoid it.</p>
<p><em>That’s why you shouldn’t have gotten closer to me. You should have thought about removing the boundary and pulling yourself out first!</em></p>
<p>The world inside the boundary seemed overwhelming just by the movement of large streaks of lightning. In the meantime, Indra’s Blade was still connected to his body, like a tube.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, all the plague clouds left behind by Joshua had already dissipated, and there was no trace of the flames this guy had unleashed in his initial attack. He was twisting his entire body in the air as the thick streaks of lightning intersected and fluctuated.</p>
<p>He was writhing in agony, seemingly unable to command his own body, and the cries he screamed were far from human. His shield had lost its radiance, and the time had come to sever his neck.</p>
<p>[You have used Seth’s Nail.]</p>
<p>My free hand raised the energy of death.</p>
<p>[You have used Hanuman’s Tail.]</p>
<p>The blazing tail exuded the same ferocity as a tiger who had given his all in the hunt.</p>
<p>[You have used Hera’s Lunacy.]</p>
<p>I raised the attack ability to the maximum and thrust at his throat.</p>
<p>“...!”</p>
<p>But to my surprise, I failed to sense the expected feeling upon contact.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With each motion of the writhing, thick lightning bolts, the residual streams of electricity crackled and shimmered. Additionally, the remnants of his fireball detonation were also intermingled within the mix.</p>
<p>It was difficult to find a flat surface anywhere on the four sides of the land that had been overturned, cracked and dug. The spot I landed on had turned into an endless cliff. It was where he crashed when I struck him with Seth's Nails.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>I could hear the beating of his heart, indicating that he was still alive. In fact, his heart was pounding even more powerfully than before, albeit at a slower pace. I wondered if he had a trait similar to the Man Who Overcomes Adversity.</p>
<p>I gazed intently at the location where the signs of him lingered. The lighting power continued to discharge in a steady stream from the tip of my spear. Similar to bullets being expelled when the trigger was pulled, the dense streaks of lightning crackled with liveliness, their trajectory guided by my Sixth Sense.</p>
<p><em>Dddddd-</em></p>
<p>As the lightning bolts rained down upon the cliff, the ground trembled violently, with countless streaks of lighting bursting forth like molten lava from a volcano. The lightning energy then began to spread, engulfing the nearby terrain and causing the very earth to convulse in agony. Despite this, his soul remained the same.</p>
<p>[You have transformed Indra’s Sword into Shiva’s Sword.]</p>
<p>Kali's Sword and Shiva’s Sword both had the same explosive flame attribute, but Kali’s Sword targeted multiple people whereas Shiva’s Sword was best for a ranged attack. I shot it with the intention of burying him at the bottom of the world. The lightning-powered raptors were still chasing him and nibbling at the crust.</p>
<p><em>BAAAANG-!</em></p>
<p>I had already taken to the air prior to the detonation. The terrain below disintegrated completely. The sound of his heartbeat was drowned out by the deafening roar of the ruptured earth’s crust.</p>
<p>Yet, I couldn’t be certain that the blast had killed him. The shattered crust had come to a standstill and fell silent, but soon began to rumble and convulse once again, this time with even greater ferocity.</p>
<p>He was coming up from the bottom! I shot another lightning bolt at him, but eventually one of his arms appeared on the land.</p>
<p>The arm wasn’t that of a human, resembling instead the limb of a reptilian humanoid, similar to the ruling class of the Barba Corps. However, it was longer and thicker, and its skin was covered in dry, scarlet scales, while its nails were sharp and pointed.</p>
<p><em>Did he shed his skin?</em></p>
<p>That battle with him was merely the opening as the boundary was still intact.</p>
<p>1. The "cosmos-destroying conflagration at the close of a Kalpa" refers to a catastrophic event in Hindu and Buddhist cosmology where the universe is engulfed in an all-consuming fire, leading to its destruction and the beginning of a new cycle. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 365</p>
<p>He slowly emerged, overcoming the onslaught of my immense lightning power… So as he shed the guise of an extraterrestrial being and revealed his true form, he was now more formidable than ever before.</p>
<p>The shattered rocks were propelled skyward, accompanied by a flurry of dirt and debris. Despite my efforts to put some distance between us by leaping from one debris pile to the next, he remained hot on my heels, moving at a speed equal to that of an Awakened in Ender section.</p>
<p>The human mask on his countenance had vanished entirely. Sharp fangs now protruded out of his mouth while tough scales covered his entire body, even his face. Furthermore, his pupils were vertically slit and blazed with a crimson hue.</p>
<p>When his eyes glared with the determination that he would stick his fangs on my neck, I felt the air squirming in front of me. His ability to manipulate space was equally matched with that of the Guide in the Final Stage, exhibiting remarkable swiftness.</p>
<p>He was chasing me, but he had one hand stretched out in front. It wasn’t close enough to stab the Lightning Spear. Starting with his arm stretching out as if he was exiting the gate, his entire body came out. His grip was like a viper with its jaw wide open.</p>
<p>The tendrils of lightning power chewed away at his flesh, yet he remained seemingly unfazed, making no attempt to charge me with the intention of dying together. As the scales were shed from his body, revealing his rippling muscles beneath, fresh scales sprouted forth at a remarkably swift rate.</p>
<p><strong>[You have used Gate Formation.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Power: 318 / 320]</strong></p>
<p>I flung open the gate in the direction of his charging from, positioning the entrance directly in his path and the exit beneath my feet. This was to ensure that I would be able to capture him as he passed through and dropped below me.</p>
<p>To be precise, this occurred just as his tail passed through the gate. I was planning to pierce his body from his hip to the top with a spear that I held upside down, but he was too fast.</p>
<p>As his outstretched arm vanished from my line of sight, I suddenly felt an enormous pressure bearing down upon the top of my head. Although I had not witnessed it with my own eyes, I knew that his arm had been aimed directly at my head. His speed had been so great that I was unable to react in time to prepare for his next attack.</p>
<p>However, I couldn’t believe what happened at that moment. Something flashed in front of me, and I couldn’t confirm what exactly attacked me. My shield shattered from a single strike, and probably because my barrier had been weakened, I was enveloped in a searing heat that made everything I saw turn red instantaneously. I couldn’t tell if it was his actual fist or a projection aggregated with extreme heat that hit me.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I had already fallen down the cliff. I seemed to be somewhere below the surface of the land. Something was tying me up. The red lines that even tied Hanuman’s tail were connected to his body.</p>
<p>Upon making eye contact with his vertically torn pupils, flames in the shape of arrows began to pour out of his hands. The sheer quantity of them was staggering, so much so that the blue radiance of my Lightning Spear was momentarily eclipsed.</p>
<p>They poured upon me with such ferocity that I was caught off guard. I wasn’t ready for his sudden onslaught. All I could manage was to raise the gate above my head, directly in the path of the arrows’ trajectory, and position the exit on his side, in the hopes that he would be vulnerable to his own attack.</p>
<p>Then, he slipped beneath me, gazing upward with eyes that promised to send me to hell. His forehead writhed as he continued to weave his way through the barrage of arrows raining down through the gate.</p>
<p>Despite this, I used all my lightning power to sever the binding lines that constricted me. The more the red lines and lightning power clashed, the more sparks flashed. He appeared to be fixated on my hand that clutched the Thunderbolt, eagerly anticipating the moment it would be relinquished and come crashing down upon him.</p>
<p>Right then, the surrounding bedrock layers couldn’t withstand our collision. A huge rock fell and was smashed to pieces by the fire arrows. From then on, a landslide occurred as everything all around us started to collapse.</p>
<p>As the dirt inundated my eyes, ears, and nostrils, the binding lines constricting my limbs suddenly went slack, providing a fleeting sense of liberation. However, his hand swiftly shot toward my neck, exerting a powerful force that felt as though he was attempting to decapitate me, rather than merely seizing my throat.</p>
<p>[Strongman has been activated.]</p>
<p>When his blade hit the center of my neck, his head tilted back. He wouldn’t have expected this.</p>
<p>[Forerunner has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Sensitive has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Gifted has been activated.]</p>
<p>I had been conserving these abilities, just as he seemed to have been holding back his final trump card. As I activated the Man Who Overcomes Adversity, these traits maximized my Agility and Sense to the extreme overload section. This was the moment for me, just as he took off his human skin and became stronger.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Breaking through the binding lines was a trivial task now. Although it required the entirety of my shield’s power, I needed to extricate myself from their restraints while he was preoccupied with defending against my attacks.</p>
<p>[You have used the Punishment of the Moong Water God.]</p>
<p>I had no intention of inflicting immediate damage with this skill, as it was designed to cause excruciating agony by scorching the skin on one’s wrists and ankles.</p>
<p>Everything was already on fire anyway. The bedrock was shattered into a fine powder, while the detonation had obliterated everything in its vicinity. Thanks to Ra’s Blessing, my Flame Resistance had surged dramatically, allowing me to shield myself and a portion of the surrounding area.</p>
<p>However, the infernal realm he had summoned was an ominous portent of the world’s end, as all kinds of flames were consumed by Ra's Sun Cape.</p>
<p>A whirlpool formed by spray, the Punishment of the Moong Water God, was destroyed before it could reach him. Nonetheless, the recuperative qualities inherent to this ability were steadily restoring any injuries that remained unhealed by his natural regenerative capabilities to a certain extent, thereby preventing him from losing consciousness.</p>
<p>My desire to continue to fight within the boundary had completely evaporated as this place had become a favorable environment for him. The scorching flames didn’t seem to cause him any harm. Instead, he appeared to be able to manipulate them at will, just as he had when I witnessed him standing unscathed in the midst of a fire pit.</p>
<p><em>Swaaaaaak-!</em></p>
<p>He tried to move the space while standing up. However, I shot the tip of the spear at his face. The battle had not lasted long enough for my Passion for advancing to the next level and the duration of Odin’s Thunderstorm to elapse.</p>
<p>Lightning fragments and flames exploded in his face. The heat from all directions was poking my whole body again, so I continued to attack him persistently. I trampled on his chest so that he wouldn’t be swept away by the storm and released the lighting power at the end of the spear toward him.</p>
<p>Just as he could handle flames in various forms, such as a sphere, tidal wave, or arrow, I was able to manipulate lightning in the same way. Lightning sparks began to flare up on his face. Of course, he attempted to free himself from my feet, but I swiftly detected any attempts using my highly attuned Sense and stopped him by using my unparalleled speed. This ensured that he remained trapped.</p>
<p><em>Zing!</em></p>
<p>His entire body fluttered with a huge movement whenever he was shocked by the electricity, and it wasn’t a surprise. Those were all reflexive on his part.</p>
<p>Despite receiving intense shocks that would have shattered his skull, it was remarkable that he endured them and persisted. His skin and facial tissues melted away, exposing the skeleton beneath his burning eyes.</p>
<p>Then, I was able to identify the reason why he had near-immortal resistance. The Skeletal Dragon that even the Living Worship… An energy that had filled the dragon was inside him in red instead of black. That was why it felt like he was staring at me even though he had lost his eyes. Every time the red energy fluttered inside the deep-cut sockets, it was accompanied with a deep set anger toward me.</p>
<p>However, even the Skeletal Dragon was eventually defeated in the battle against Doom Dejire, proving that immortality didn’t truly exist. Well… There was such a thing as ‘Resurrection’ though.</p>
<p>I constantly exerted lightning power to block his resistance. He had nothing left. All his muscles and organs were burned without leaving a trace. Even the heart that sent blood all over his body with heavy thuds was gone. All that was left was a blackened skull. But even that was cracking.</p>
<p>However, the intensity of the red energy circulating in his skull was increasing rapidly, and I recognized the familiar phenomenon as the energy concentrated toward his mouth. It was similar to when Skeletal Dragon would unleash its powerful breath attack. With energy vibrations more intense than the dragon, I could only assume that whatever he was about to unleash would be stronger than that of the dragon.</p>
<p>It was dead, but its last will at the moment of death might have remained and was preparing for the final blow.</p>
<p>I moved and created a gate in case a dead skeleton poured its breath down on me.</p>
<p>[<strong>You have used Gate Formation.]</strong></p>
<p>The exit was toward the sky at the top of the boundary. Finally, the red energy exploded from his skull between the maxillary and mandible, and a fire, which was hard to describe as mere flames, erupted on another level. The skull twisted towards me.</p>
<p>The fire was wide enough to cover the entire gate, but even if I had expanded the gate, it wouldn’t have worked from the beginning. The damn alarm rang in my mind when the flame, which was supposed to disappear as if it was absorbed into the gate, poured out.</p>
<p>I quickly leaped to avoid the coming attack, but my foot got stuck in the edge of his breath. At first, I didn’t feel any pain, but when I saw that my lower legs were gone, my body twisted in agony. I couldn’t tell if I was actually screaming or silently crying as a searing pain flashed before my eyes. But that was only for a few seconds.</p>
<p>[The Man Who Overcomes Adversity has been activated.]</p>
<p>I was able to stand on the ground now. In the direction where breath swept through, red lava was boiling and flowing through the cracks of the earth after melting everything. His skull was breaking apart into powder as if he had done his job.</p>
<p><strong>[You have found and removed one of the Holy Knights, Dragorin ‘Red.’]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Your master is satisfied with you.]</strong></p>
<p>An unidentified energy came into me.</p>
<p><strong>[You have obtained 60 Power.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Power 377 / 380]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You have received a command from your master, Doom Kaos.]</strong></p>
<p>[Find One More Dragorin ‘Red,’ and Remove It (Command)</p>
<p>If the direct blood lineage of the Ancient Dragon ‘the Great Red’ is eliminated, it will be forced to awaken from its long sleep even if its body is not fully healed. We should prepare for that moment. There is only one descendant of ‘the Great Red’ left.</p>
<p>However, don’t be conceited. You will have to be careful, especially in Elsland, as they now know you are here.</p>
<p>* The Queen of Elsland might be the Ancient Dragon ‘The Great Green.’ If that is confirmed, then you should remove her in advance.</p>
<p>* The majority of the Holy Knights with the blood of Ancient Dragons are not aware of their ancestors. However, being aware that families with significant lineage at this level are typically descended from Ancient Dragons could help you in locating them.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you could detect them by observing their anger and intensification characteristics, as their blood is filled with fury against your master and his subordinates.</p>
<p>- If the Queen of Elsland is an Ancient Dragon (Remove Queen of Elsland)</p>
<p>If you succeed: Additional inherent power will be given. An opportunity to challenge the ranking of the upper monarch, Doom Mount.</p>
<p>If you fail: No penalty.</p>
<p>- If the Queen of Elsland is not an Ancient Dragon (Additional Removal of Dragorin Red)</p>
<p>If you succeed: No reward</p>
<p>If you fail: Your master will be greatly disappointed in you.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 366</p>
<p>After receiving the new command, I quickly moved away from the area as it was engulfed in flames and flowing lava. I had no intention of staying and risking getting burned.</p>
<p>My stats, skills, and traits were all raised to their maximum thanks to Man Who Overcomes Adversity. Odin’s Thunderstorm in Zeus’s Lightning Spear vibrated in my hand with a power that could cut through the sky. It was ready to unleash its full potential out to the world.</p>
<p>However, going straight to Elsland was reckless. The man who was a descendant of an Ancient Dragon was powerful enough for me to struggle, so the strength of an Ancient Dragon itself would be unbelievable.</p>
<p>If the Queen of Elsland was an Ancient Dragon as described in the mission… If she was one of the devices that Old One had made with all his heart and soul, then I needed to be prepared accordingly. Of course, I had to check if the Ancient Dragon actually existed or not.</p>
<p>I focused my Senses on the signs from the four directions with the intention of calling Joshua’s surviving attackers to come back. I smelled blood and heard the sound of war, but I realized something had been following me all the way. I couldn’t afford to care earlier as the battle against Dragorin Red had been extremely fierce.</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell when it started, but it was clear that it had been following me since the beginning of the battle. Now it was tracking me. It was an entity without a physical form, yet it felt real when I encountered it with my heightened Sense rather than relying on my naked eyes.</p>
<p><em>Is it magic?</em></p>
<p>“You’ve lost your nerve.”</p>
<p>I turned and stabbed my spear into the air. As a matter of fact, the spear had been vibrating due to an uncontrolled force.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>“Gub dae ga ri reunr― sang sil hae ggoon. (You’ve lost your nerve)”</em></p>
<p>Right at that sound…</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>…Ruthra’s head snapped back violently. The force of the blow caused the back of her head to touch the back of her neck and her chin to lift toward the ceiling. The movement was swift and sudden. Moments later, Ruthra’s body was thrown back with equal force suddenly. It also happened so fast that Ruthra’s children couldn’t protect her.</p>
<p>The Court of Light, Elsland, was fortified by the dignified magic of the ancients, so Ruthra was only thrown to the ground after being smashed into the wall. As she looked up, her children came into her blurred vision.</p>
<p>The children running out of the room were likely going to call the court’s healing shamans. Ruthra wanted to tell them it was no use, but all that came out when she opened her mouth was a handful of blood from her lungs.</p>
<p>The problem wasn’t the physical injury she got when she hit the wall. The healing shamans could easily cure that, so the real problem was her mind, which had been impacted the most. It wasn’t a matter that could be resolved by the queen’s blessing, so she knew it was time for her to make a decision. There were several things she needed to explain and pass along to her kids before her mind was completely destroyed.</p>
<p>Ruthra’s children carried her to her bed, and when the healing shaman arrived, he examined her inner wounds and left a message that all they could do now was pray for her peaceful rest. Kanonas, her son, said to Ruthra as they looked at the shaman walking further away from them, “Don’t worry, Mother. You may not know, but he is quite competent.”</p>
<p>She responded, “If you say so, that must be true.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>She added, “But you should always be on the lookout for court battles.”</p>
<p>“Mother…”</p>
<p>She continued quickly, “I don’t have much time. You have to deliver the story I’m about to tell you to the queen. Not through the queen’s or your faction, but you need to do it yourself, Kanonas.”</p>
<p>Ruthra perched on the bed’s edge and looked at her son who knelt before her. With one hand, she swept her hair behind her ear, causing the pointed tip of her ear to protrude.</p>
<p>“Two Holy Knights died in Greenwood Continent.”</p>
<p>That wasn’t what Kanonas was curious about.</p>
<p><em>Is this about another fight between the Holy Knights?</em></p>
<p>The Greenwood Continent was a war-ridden zone due to the presence of various orc clans. As a result, the natives of Greenwood were often regarded as short-sighted as the orcs. They tended to resort to violence, using knives and seeking bloodshed even in situations where social and legal solutions were possible.</p>
<p>Even in the past three hundred years of his life, many kingdoms on the Greenwood Continent had risen and fallen in a perpetual cycle of strife and conflict.</p>
<p>Anyway, Kanonas quickly realized that his mother had been struck hard while observing the situation in Greenwood. He knew immediately that none of the natives there had the ability to cause such damage to her mind. Kanonas suppressed himself from asking questions as his mother would tell him about everything.</p>
<p>“Have you ever heard of Caldoran, the Guardian of the Land of Whirlpool?” she asked.</p>
<p>He frowned. “Is he one of the dead Holy Knights?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then, yes, I have.”</p>
<p>The natives on Greenwood had short life spans compared to other species, but they showed more vigorous growth than any others while they were alive. The problem was that they spent their lives in fratricidal wars.</p>
<p>Caldoran and his family had a noble fate in the sense that they had never lost their territory or caused wars out of greed, even during the intense battles between the Holy Knights on the Greenwood Continent. Caldoran was the current head of the family, and he was not only the strongest in Greenwood, but also among all the Holy Knights.</p>
<p>“You must have not expected this.”</p>
<p>“Yes…” Kanonas replied.</p>
<p>“It is the same for me. It’s as shocking as the news that King Onyx, another Holy Knight, was killed.”</p>
<p>“King Onyx…”</p>
<p>Among the Holy Knights, there were absolute powerhouses. King Onyx of the Onyx Kingdom and Caldoran, the guardian of the Land of Whirlpool, were two of such individuals. Such powerful figures were present on the Greenwood Continent, so hostile dwarves and inferior orcs couldn’t even try to invade them.</p>
<p>“Caldoran and King Onyx died on the Land of Whirlpool, but their deaths weren’t that of a big deal compared to the story that I’m about to tell you. My sword, Kanonas. Come closer.”</p>
<p>Kanonas slowly raised himself up as if Ruthra was dragging him in with an elegant hand gesture. The two of them sitting side by side on the bed looked more like a couple than a mother-and-son. Ruthra continued the story, stroking his blonde hair, “You might already know that one of the Demon King’s corps attacked the small country in Greenwood.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but I thought there was a Holy Knight family with the Grand Wizard there.”</p>
<p>“His name is Ronsius. I was worried about him at first because the darkness that would overwhelm him was too dark. When I got there, it was too late.”</p>
<p>Unlike Ruthra’s calm expression, Kanonas’s was filled with sorrow and despair. Regardless of whether Caldoran and Onyx were dead or if Ronsius was in trouble, the undeniable fact was that this was an internal problem of the Greenwood Continent, and his mother was deeply involved in the clan’s affairs and had been irreparably hurt. The moment was too early for his mother to take the risk herself.</p>
<p>Kanonas wanted to resent that, but he couldn’t bear to do so in front of his mother who was on the verge of death.</p>
<p>“The foreboding of greater darkness looms ahead, and it is also the will of our Lord. The queen is aware of this much.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>Ruthra stated, “Until then, we didn’t know what Caldoran and his old family were guarding. My assumption was that their intention was to safeguard either the physical remnants of the War of the New Devil or an object possessing the divine power of our Lord Lacryma.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“But now I know that they were guarding a passage.”</p>
<p>Kanonas asked, “A passage?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Yes, it was such an important passage that King Onyx had to come and help protect it. I’m sure the queen is in despair because she had no choice but to ignore their request. However, it’s not her fault. It’s our, the nobles’, fault.”</p>
<p>Only then did Kanonas realize the truth of the recent aristocratic conference.</p>
<p>“What kind of passage was it?” he asked.</p>
<p>She replied, “It was connected to one of the six Demon Kings.”</p>
<p>The sound of a hiss came out through Kanonas’s teeth as he widened his eyes. The emotion that made his entire body tremble was similar to a shiver. It was a horrified shudder. Through his mother’s words, the unknown entity, which had only been mentioned in Saint Cassian’s records and ancient legends, began to take form in Kanonas’s mind.</p>
<p>The agenda that was handled at the last aristocratic meeting wasn’t detailed. It was just that the Greenwood Continent needed help from the Grand Temple, and Kanonas himself was opposed to the idea of sending troops to them. If he had known that it was an issue related to the Demon King, then would he have agreed with the idea?</p>
<p>Kanonas stared at his mother’s face, thinking nothing would have changed. Then, he began to blame himself not because he joined the opposition forces, but because the conclusion of that meeting had impacted his mother…</p>
<p>In the end, Kanonas noticed what had hurt his mother’s mind. It was the devil. The Demon King who came out of the passage!</p>
<p>“It’s not your fault either, Kanonas. The blame falls on those who failed to protect the passage even though they were aware of the consequences. With ample forces nearby to guard the passage, there was no reason for them to rely on far-off Elsland. However, due to their ongoing internal conflicts, they failed to support each other.”</p>
<p>He responded bitterly, “The natives of Greenwood have always been like that, Mother.”</p>
<p><em>So why did you try to intervene for them?</em></p>
<p>An empty cry began to echo in Kanonas’s mind.</p>
<p>“Caldoran was killed by the priest of a Demon King. That was how the passage opened.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“And King Onyx struggled with the Demon and was killed in battle.”</p>
<p>Kanonas felt something weird. He was aware that King Onyx was absolutely powerful, but apparently, he wasn’t a match for a Demon King.</p>
<p><em>Is the Demon King that weak such that King Onyx could put up a fight against it?</em></p>
<p>If so, there was no reason to be afraid of the arrival of the Demon King, but this was a violation of the contents on Saint Cassian’s record. Ruthra smiled at the confusion on Kanonas’s face.</p>
<p>“There are many records the court has that you haven’t accessed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I know that.”</p>
<p>“There are pages about the existence of ‘Dragorin’ among them. If you tell the queen today’s story, then you will be able to take a step closer to the truth.”</p>
<p>When Kanonas mentioned the name Dragorin again, Ruthra’s previously calm face momentarily contorted. She suddenly turned into a fierce look and stared at Kanonas, as if she had suddenly changed into a completely different elf.</p>
<p>The gaze was gone after Ruthra shook her head.</p>
<p>“Just tell the queen that King Onyx was Dragorin. No matter how the queen uses that truth, you…”</p>
<p>He sighed. “Mother, court politics has a lot of complexities. You already know about that.”</p>
<p>“No matter how the queen uses the fact, all you have to do is promise to remain silent on the issue. I’m telling you to be faithful just as a messenger, Kanonas.”</p>
<p>Kanonas couldn’t help but know that his mother’s end was just around the corner.</p>
<p>“...I promise.”</p>
<p>He nodded slowly. He couldn’t touch his mother’s face at first, but Ruthra gently pulled Kanonas’s neck toward her with the same hand that stroked his hair. Their kiss wasn’t very long as Kanonas pushed her away at the point when Ruthra’s lips and tongue moved aggressively.</p>
<p>The only thing connecting them was the saliva that had passed from mouth to mouth. Kanonas looked at Ruthra, who had a pained expression on her face as if she was on the verge of crying, laughing, or getting angry. Kanonas wanted to hear the truth from her, despite the societal pressures of law, morality, and noble honor of the elves. Individuals tended to show their weaknesses and negative traits during the state of mental destruction.</p>
<p>“Mother, do you really want the future of our family to be bet on the queen?” he asked.</p>
<p>Ruthra was trembling, but she opened her mouth to speak as her eyes glinted with aggressiveness.</p>
<p>“The queen… Seems to want to sleep with you…. That bitch. That must be the chance. In the queen’s bedroom… there is… what you want…” Ruthra whispered.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Mother.”</p>
<p>However, she didn’t respond to him. Kanonas lifted Ruthra as she fell toward the floor. It wasn’t comforting that she wouldn’t suffer from pain as she was out of her mind. The court had just lost one of their prophets, but for Kanonas himself, it was a moment when he lost his mother and his old lover.</p>
<p>“Rest in peace under the blessing of our God Lacryma.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t hold back his tears any longer and began sobbing uncontrollably.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 367</p>
<p>Jessica had been taking antidepressants and the new stimulant, Spider Web, under the impression that the last fertility procedure had failed. Therefore, she deeply regretted this decision. Moreover, when she learned that Joshua’s bodily fluids were filled with lethal poison, the memory of being drenched in his blood haunted her.</p>
<p>She was anxiously waiting for the test results, then Gillian came into the waiting room.</p>
<p>“How is Joshua?” Jessica asked. She recalled how he had managed to leave the office, despite bleeding and stumbling, with a determined look on his face.</p>
<p>She had been struck by his creepy eyes and hideous, disfigured face. He was definitely more infected than his attack squad members as his face was more damaged. His once handsome features were now obscured by hardened, sickly-green scabs, which were a result of the infection.</p>
<p>She hadn’t expected Joshua to come back from the Stage of Advent with such an appearance and realized why he had no choice but to live in darkness inside the robe without appearing in public.</p>
<p>“I heard he is getting better,” Gillian replied.</p>
<p>“Did you hear that directly from him?”</p>
<p>Gillian shook his head. An hour had passed since Joshua had stumbled outside the room, so the surprise in Gillian’s face was gone. However, he looked disconsolate whenever he remembered how gruesome Joshua’s condition had been and the way he was suffering from pain.</p>
<p>Gillian redirected his attention to the ultrasound picture of the fetus that Jessica was holding, and upon estimating the date, he realized that the baby was conceived during their defense of the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>Gillian sat on the bed thinking about how Jessica felt while getting the procedure on that day.</p>
<p>“How are you?” he finally asked.</p>
<p>She grimaced. “I’m fine, but the baby…”</p>
<p>Jessica’s smartphone appeared to be abandoned on the floor, and there was information about the side effects of antidepressants on the fetus. Jessica’s fingerprints were spotted on the screen.</p>
<p>Gillian expressed his honest feelings, “I have no idea…what is going on.”</p>
<p>He was more concerned than happy about the child. However, he couldn’t blame Jessica as she was the one who wanted the baby the most and was in a challenging situation where she needed antidepressants to function. Despite years of failed, painful procedures, she was always willing to undergo the procedure again, fully aware of the possibility of it failing once more, even on the day of a successful attempt.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the impact of Moclobemide, the substance present in Jessica’s antidepressant, on the fetus was uncertain, unlike other antidepressants that were known to have adverse effects. For this reason, Jessica’s physician prescribed the medication, explaining that there was a risk of negative consequences for the fetus, but the benefits to the mother outweighed the potential risks.</p>
<p>“Let’s wait for now,” Gillian said while holding Jessica’s trembling hand.</p>
<p>Jessica asked, “Is it because of the baby? It’s going to be fine.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, it’s because of Joshua. It was my first time seeing him after he returned from the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>It was also her first time witnessing someone in such pain. As his face was already hideous, the face distorted by pain reminded her of evil.</p>
<p>After a while, Jessica noticed that Joshua put a priority on the possibility of the association being under attack, rather than seeking immediate medical attention for his own injuries. This thought prompted her to reflect on a multitude of things.</p>
<p>The two became quiet, and medical staff from the association came in with the test results. The explanation, which began with the results dealing with the risk of deformities in the heart, musculoskeletal system, skull, and digestive organs, was as much expected news as it made the two nervous.</p>
<p>There was no issue with the fetus as the doctor said the baby was as healthy as any other ordinary fetus. Still, the pharmacists suggested that she stop taking antidepressants containing moclobemide.</p>
<p>Jessica was so relaxed that she shed tears.</p>
<p>“Our baby is healthy.”</p>
<p>When Gillian let out an emotional voice over the ultrasound picture, Jessica couldn’t stop sobbing while tightly hugging the blanket.</p>
<p>Gillian patiently waited for her to stop crying to tell her something. The door that the healthcare professionals closed was opened again by a man. Considering all the equipment on him, he was obviously an Awakened.</p>
<p>The sound of people running around was in full swing outside the open door.</p>
<p>He announced, “You both are going to outer space.”</p>
<p>“But my wife is pregnant…” Gillian protested.</p>
<p>The Awakened shook his head. “It’s Odin’s order. It won’t be long before you come back to earth.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about me. I’m fine with that.”</p>
<p>Jessica got out of bed first with a guilty expression.</p>
<p>The Awakened guided the two to the building where the Safety Bureau was located. It was right next to the building where a powerful Maruka monster called Orca was coiled up. However, everyone’s attention was fixated on the thing in front of the main gate of the Safety Bureau rather than the hideous tentacles.</p>
<p>The gate corresponded with the phenomenon that was recorded by the cameras on the Day of Advent, which marked the return of the Awakened after the Final Stage. Not only were the Gillian couple there, but there were also those who came in as visitors. They were all looking at it.</p>
<p>Many Awakened were seen rushing towards the gate, while military trucks made their way inside at a slow pace. The association’s mercenaries, armed with automatic firearms, were also disappearing into the gate as if an urgent war had broken out.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As the sun set, the sky was bathed in a scarlet glow, and a moon patiently awaited its turn to shine in full light. Gillian became aware that he had entered outer space due to the presence of a massive planet that dominated a significant portion of the sky, eclipsing both the sun and the moon. The appearance of marbled blue and white paint on a single bead was quite consistent with the picture of the earth seen from the moon.</p>
<p>The sky of this world was familiar but mysterious. It even appeared to be peaceful.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the terrain was in disarray, and groans echoed in the air. The moans were the sounds of pain from the fights. Jessica and Gillian were acquainted with these noises, having heard Joshua making similar groans just a few hours earlier.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the mercenaries who entered first were divided into two groups. One group was busy splitting up and setting up tents all over the place, while the other was racing around the area in an armored car with an open roof.</p>
<p>The Awakened were gathered where groans could be heard, and lights were repeatedly appearing and vanishing. They could see Odin there, but they couldn’t get closer to him as he was walking among the injured, giving instructions to the Awakened with a firm expression.</p>
<p>Right then…</p>
<p><em>Seuk-</em></p>
<p>…Joshua’s black robe passed by the two. Although he wasn’t clutching his abdomen like he was the other day, his posture was still slightly bent forward, which indicated that he hadn’t completely healed.</p>
<p>Jessica couldn’t bear to talk to Joshua. He was making his way towards Odin and his wounded comrades, with an air of tension visible on his back.</p>
<p>She saw Joshua and Odin start having a conversation. Jessica suddenly realized that the Awakened who had guided her had disappeared. Gillian was also looking around for him.</p>
<p>Then, a military vehicle stopped in front of them. The Awakened who guided them was in the passenger seat. He stretched his arm out of the window and pointed at the back seat.</p>
<p>“I was ordered to show you the battlefield.”</p>
<p>Contrary to the fanciful depictions that had captured the public’s imagination, the alien world was a bleak expanse, with charred ground stretching out in all directions. The car’s windshield wipers were busy trying to clear the clinging ash powder, producing a high-speed, fricative sound.</p>
<p>Upon passing through those areas, they started to see corpses. They resembled the bodies of wild animals that were left unattended for a long time after being roadkills. Bubbles were popping on their bodies and decay was proceeding at a fast speed.</p>
<p>From that point on, the car shook and rattled as they maneuvered around the corpses, with severed limbs remaining on the ground. Jessica and Gillian were now speechless. Gillian frowned while Jessica soothed her nauseous stomach by covering her mouth and nose with her hand.</p>
<p>In fact, Jessica felt like she was in the corner of her nightmare. She was so nauseous that she didn’t care about who won or lost. She thought the sight was too horrible to leave any meaning to the victory.</p>
<p>As Jessica grappled with the overwhelming sights around her, Gillian turned to the Awakened in the passenger seat, whose expression remained emotionless as he gazed ahead.</p>
<p>“How much do you know about Osiris?”</p>
<p>Gilian’s casual mention of Osiris’s name elicited a cold, impassive stare from the Awakened, which even extended to Jessica, who sat quietly beside Gillian. Despite this, the Awakened made an effort to respond as politely as he could.</p>
<p>“I was in the same camp with him before joining the Final Stage.”</p>
<p>“In there was Osiris…”</p>
<p>Gillian couldn’t finish his question because the car suddenly stopped. They were at the end of the steep cliff. In Gillian’s view, even the Awakened and the driver were looking at the scene that unfolded in front of them blankly.</p>
<p>After the Awakened got out of the car, the driver followed suit. Following a reassuring gesture from the Awakened, Gillian, and Jessica then exited the vehicle.</p>
<p>The Grand Canyon was often referred to as the world’s largest canyon. It had a breathtaking sight to behold, with its cliff exposing horizontal faults and the winding canyon stretching as far as the eye could see. It was a testament to the immense power of Mother Nature, whose erosive forces had shaped the landscape over hundreds of millions of years.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the scene in front of them shocked them in a different manner. Everything was black, and the earth was destroyed, creating a mess. In some places, there were gaps that seemed to stretch on indefinitely, while other clumps of crust appeared to be clearly separated from the whole.</p>
<p><em>Was there an earthquake?</em></p>
<p>Despite the absence of an actual eruption, one could easily imagine a volcano spewing molten lava, given the intense heat emanating from the area and the appearance of red vines that appeared to be bending and flowing like a liquid. Whatever natural phenomenon had occurred, it was clear that this world was coming to an end.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a strong wind blew in from behind them, causing Gillian and Jessica to instinctively shut their eyes against the stinging sensation. When they opened their eyes again, Odin stood before them.</p>
<p>Soon, the Awakened and the driver left the spot as he gestured at them. Gillian lowered his head toward him as Jessica couldn’t even bear to look straight at him. Then, Odin opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“You must have heard of the System, correct?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I heard that it’s gone now,” Gillian answered.</p>
<p>“What about Doom Kaos?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“How much do you know about him?”</p>
<p>“I basically only know that Doom Kaos had infiltrated the System, and you endured and ended its malice,” he responded.</p>
<p>Gillian didn’t hide the fact that he had been interested in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>I nodded. “We were able to go through the Final Stage in the Stage of Advent, then return to the mainland with our new strength. That was how we could get rid of alien monsters like Declan and Kciphos. You must have heard it up to this point, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I continued, “Then you must have been grateful for the mysterious presence of the System, as it had trained and empowered us to eliminate the monsters that had invaded our homeland.”</p>
<p>Gillian added, “I also know that Odin severely punishes those who worship the System.”</p>
<p>“Then what if I didn’t?” I suddenly asked Jessica. She hadn’t been able to look me in the eye since I arrived, and she had been looking at my neck instead.</p>
<p>She hesitantly replied, “The unification of religion would be progressed. The world would have been driven by a System-worshiping religion, and that future would be…horrible.”</p>
<p>I pointed out, “You didn’t like the current situation and turned into a whistleblower.”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>“Although I too have converted, there is a significant difference between us. The only similarity is that we acted with the future of our homeland and humanity in mind. However, your decision would only result in chaos and that was your intention. You wanted the public to witness my downfall and that of the association. You believed that it would resolve the crisis, but in reality, it was your misjudgment that caused it. Jessica, you betrayed me.”</p>
<p>“You have been converted…?” she asked.</p>
<p>I stated calmly, “Now I fight for Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>Gillian and Jessica’s eyes shook.</p>
<p>“Because that choice promised a more stable future for humanity, so I didn’t refuse. At least my conversion has resulted in peace, but what about yours, Jessica?”</p>
<p>I added while looking at the land that was destroyed by the battle against Dragorin, “The System’s real name is Old One, and I fought one of its soldiers there. Just one of them. Do you want that kind of battle to be a frequent occurrence on our mainland? Do you want to kill that many people?”</p>
<p>I was going to explain what kind of battlefield the Stage of Advent was, how the Old One tried to use us as consumables, and why I had to join Doom Kaos’s side.</p>
<p>However, Jessica’s conscience was the most noteworthy factor to consider before disclosing everything to them. Her conscience compelled her to relinquish everything and divulge the truth about the organization. While this was undoubtedly a commendable trait in a peaceful world, the current circumstances involved warfare.</p>
<p>“This is the last battlefield that the Old One has built to see the ultimate state with Doom Kaos. Many of the creatures and species here are bound to be swept away by the war because that is the purpose of this area. We have to destroy, kill and take away everything that remains here. The more we do that, the more secure humanity’s peace will be. The rules are that simple, Jessica.”</p>
<p>Jessica looked up and made eye contact with me with a stiffened look.</p>
<p>I continued mercilessly, “We don’t need to even talk about all of mankind. I’d like to ask if you can kill an alien for your husband and baby. The aliens on this land have the same limbs and think the same way as us.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“You are neither an Awakened nor a trained mercenary, but the fate of many beings in this realm rests on the signature you make. Your actions hold the power to reclaim many lives, just like the signatures you have signed on the documents in the past. That is the gun you are holding.”</p>
<p>My aides were expected to remain unaffected by their moral principles at least until the war’s end! That was why I pushed her even though I desperately needed her to stay.</p>
<p>“I have forgiven you and now offer you to join me in battle. The decision is yours, Jessica. Will you stay or leave?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 368</p>
<p>Jessica pondered silently. Subsequently, every word she spoke was genuine. Eventually, she decided to remain by my side. Only then were the two of them privy to the complete truth, discovering that humanity was caught in a conflict between the Old One and Doom Kaos and that I was the sixth Demon King, known as Doom Man.</p>
<p>In particular, they seemed to notice that it was meaningless to distinguish good and evil in the fight between the two cosmic beings after learning the truth of the Stage of Advent. Humans had been conscripted by the Old One without regard for their wishes, while Doom Kaos assimilated clans from other dimensions to create its own army and conducted merciless raids with the spoils of war. The two would do anything to defeat and swallow each other.</p>
<p>Silence filled the air on the way back as everyone was lost in their own thoughts. I was thinking about Saint Dragorin. I lacked knowledge of what kind of battle the War of New Devil was, but there was one thing that the Old One had been telling us day and night in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p><em>Do you need power? Then prove it.</em></p>
<p>The Ancient Dragons undoubtedly demonstrated their worthiness for power. However, what about the Dragorin, whose bloodline alone seemed to have activated the remarkable strength equivalent to the activation of the Man Who Overcomes Adversity?</p>
<p>Given that the Old One possessed the ability to construct this area and install various defense mechanisms, why did it abandon humans in the midst of this battlefield? It would have been more prudent to concentrate on the interspecies conflicts in this location.</p>
<p>Fucking assholes.</p>
<p>They were selfish. They were probably munching on popcorn as they looked down upon us, mere pieces on a chessboard.</p>
<p>However, I had to be careful not to judge their intentions and methods hastily with the little information I had so far! I needed to read the flow. If not, then I was no different from the individual investors who were busy losing money in the market by reacting to immediate events.</p>
<p>I had lowered interest rates in a manner that would bolster the global stock market, fully cognizant that the adverse aspects of the economic conflict with China would not impede this progress. I then released the stake I held in one hand, paving the way for the tide to flow in the long run.</p>
<p>However, despite such favorable circumstances, individual investors were unable to profit. They sold at a loss when China announced plans to reform its gold standard currency, bought back in when the market rebounded, only to sell at a loss again when the Awakened created issues. This cycle of buying and selling eventually led to the squandering of their own assets.</p>
<p>On the other hand, those who possessed information, such as club members and the financiers affiliated with them, who had access to the club’s long-term strategies, were in a distinct, different position. They entered the market even before the association’s inception and invested heavily during the bullish trend.</p>
<p>That was how the world worked. Nevertheless, my understanding of Doom Kaos and the Old One was limited to their selfish behavior. Rather than making assumptions about their motives, such as why they sought to eliminate each other, why they engaged in a protracted battle with their underlings instead of confronting each other directly, and how far they were willing to go, I required precise information to form a plan.</p>
<p>How much did the other Dooms know? What about the Ancient Dragons?</p>
<p>Upon our return to the garrison, I noticed unfamiliar faces who had arrived via the river on motorized rubber boats. They were dressed in combat attire featuring the emblems of private corporations and had apparently crossed the boundary after discovering the association’s flag on the garrison.</p>
<p>Their conversations weren’t important. Private company mercenaries sought to ascertain the extent of the association’s territory, prompting association mercenaries to provide a standardized response indicating that such matters were beyond their purview. Although I didn’t pay much attention to them, I could tell that they were failing to get to the point.</p>
<p><em>“Why can’t you get confirmation from your boss?”</em></p>
<p>One of the association’s mercenaries found me staring at them. When I nodded to him from a distance, he grasped my approval.</p>
<p><em>“This is the operational area of the highest leadership of the association.”</em></p>
<p><em>“How high is their position?”</em></p>
<p><em>“The top of the association. Do I really need to mention their names?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ah… Okay, I get it. I’ll let our leader know. Is there anything we can do for you?”</em></p>
<p><em>“If any of your Awakened has the ability to heal, please send them here. We are not forcing you though.”</em></p>
<p>I could sense Joshua from the hills in the distance.</p>
<p>After sending Gillian and Jessica back to the gate, I headed toward Joshua. He gazed fixedly at the tents where the squad members were receiving treatment, emanating a dark aura that dissuaded anyone from approaching him. It appeared that he had deliberately vacated the tent to allow the healers to concentrate on their tasks without being distracted by his presence.</p>
<p>His relationship with his squad members was solid because they were the minority who had survived situations where every single one of them was on the verge of death. I took a seat beside him and sensed a feeling of bereavement emanating from the necromancer’s robe he was adorned in.</p>
<p>“I saw a city five kilometers south of here. Is that the home of the Caldoran family?”</p>
<p>We continued with our previously unfinished conversation.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Will you come with me? If you ignore the spoils, only the dead will be mad.”</p>
<p>“...I thought you decided not to intervene in getting profits here.”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you to retrieve spoils under your group’s name. All the association did was pick up the wounded. Anyway, I hope there’s a trophy that made the journey worthwhile because the Holy Knight you fought against was one of the strongest in this world.”</p>
<p>“Then… I can deal with this by myself. You don’t have to step in, Master.”</p>
<p>I patted Joshua on the shoulder and got up from the seat.</p>
<p>“No, let’s go together.”</p>
<p>He acted like he was fine, but he was still severely injured.</p>
<p>“Joshua.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Do you know that there are items that contain the power of the Old One here?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This was one of the lands that were ravaged by fire. The roads that had extended in all directions and private houses outside the city were destroyed. A vast part of the land was still infected by the plague.</p>
<p>As per Joshua’s account, Holy Knight Caldoran had stood to watch over the region throughout the night before relocating the battlefield elsewhere. It appeared that their key members followed suit, including those who had displayed resilience against the plague.</p>
<p>Therefore, only the regular soldiers were left manning the walls. Strangely, the flag bearing the Caldoran family emblem was missing, replaced instead by a white flag symbolizing surrender. To compound matters, the gate was also ajar.</p>
<p>As we stepped in, there were individuals waiting for us to show up with an elderly person holding a large jewelry box in the middle. Those in luxurious clothes, the ruling class of the city, were there as well. They were definitely aristocrats.</p>
<p>“You guys are smart.”</p>
<p>It appeared as though they had been aware of the impending war. The city had long been governed by a family that had proclaimed themselves as the guardians of the Land of Whirlpool for generations. However, following the ruler’s downfall, the aristocrats of the city banded together and wrested control from the existing ruling class.</p>
<p>My conviction in this belief was strengthened by the sight of bodies hanging from the walls; they were likely members of the Caldoran family.</p>
<p>Joshua made eye contact with me, then took the lead. From then on, a verdant aura began to emanate along his shoulder line. As the cooldown time for Osiris’s Domain had not yet elapsed, he instead employed the Cloud of Plague, which could be activated at will.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, considering that the city’s nobles flinched at every step that Joshua took, he seemed to have been engraved as the symbol of fear here. It seemed unnecessary for me to step up and create more fear. I couldn’t sense any movement of the military, and their surrender was beyond doubt anyway.</p>
<p>I walked down the road where Joshua passed by. The elderly person waited for Joshua to approach him, then started talking about something, likely the jewelry box. Despite this, Joshua didn’t retrieve the box and instead proceeded directly through the path they had opened. The elderly person and aristocrats trailed behind him from a considerable distance.</p>
<p>Joshua was heading to the castle in the heart of the city. He kept pace with my footsteps, then the nobles realized that I had more authority than Joshua. When they buzzed with pale faces, we entered the shopping district after passing through the crowded residences.</p>
<p>The road was empty, and most of the windows were closed. Eyeballs full of curiosity and fear of the invaders peeked around from the slightly open windows.</p>
<p>Then, I detected the signs of an ambush for the first time. It was at the heart of the city, where five-story commercial edifices began to show up.</p>
<p>Joshua smirked, but he didn’t stop walking. Instead, the green aura that was rising along his shoulder line began to spread into the fog like evil spirits that had received life from their masters.</p>
<p>The green hue permeating the fog was dark, and it spread like wildfire toward the windows of the highest floor of the building. Every time Joshua’s evil spirit penetrated through the wooden window frames there, all kinds of groans came out. It was then those who were armed in protective barriers began to throw themselves out of the window.</p>
<p>Even then, I didn’t deem it necessary to intervene as I knew that no one there could stop Joshua’s progress. The stupid bastards screeched and poured down towards Joshua, enveloped in a green cloud. The results they expected never happened as their bodies were sliced in half before falling to the ground.</p>
<p>One of Joshua’s eight skills was similar to Hanuman’s Tail.</p>
<p><em>Sheek- Sheek-!</em></p>
<p>His skill possessed a whip-shaped instrument that exuded an aura of death instead of a fiery appendage, and it was wielded with a swiftness that evaded even the keenest eye. Those who were screaming in agony were those without the courage to fight back. The road was in disarray with blood and corpses pouring down from the sky.</p>
<p>I had no desire to wash up again. As I passed Joshua, the scenery adjacent to him was even more gruesome. Corpses littered the ground, and blood stains accumulated along the path he had traversed. The rapid decay of the cadavers caused toxic fumes to permeate the air, shrouding the streets in a thick fog.</p>
<p>Furthermore, his Cloud of Plague had diffused beyond the confines of the building after fulfilling its objective. They were shaped like clouds in a manner that threatened the entire street.</p>
<p>When there were no further attacks, Joshua looked back. His eyes were on the crowd of nobles who had stopped at the beginning of the street. It was clear now what the city’s nobles had to do, which was to protest that they had nothing to do with the previous attack. They were the ones who had killed the ruling family and hung them on the wall.</p>
<p>Although they were likely uninvolved in the incident, they were so terrified by the sight that they were rendered speechless, trembling in fear. Then…</p>
<p><em>Srrrr-</em></p>
<p>The green clouds floating on the street sank toward the nobles. Due to the toxic fumes and the presence of green clouds, I was unable to witness their struggle. Moreover, employing Night Eye to observe their demise would have been futile.</p>
<p>Anyway, the green clouds that engulfed the aristocrats were only small in size, but the green clouds continued to rise and concentrated over the city. As they overlapped and expanded, it steadily took control of the entire sky.</p>
<p>The clouds had eclipsed the moon. Thus, the moonlight illuminated the city through the green haze. Although the plague had consumed the entire city, it appeared as if it hadn’t. The Cloud of Plague, which had eradicated all the inhabitants of the city, pervaded the atmosphere, awaiting instructions from its master. The windows, which had been opened with care, were now promptly shuttered.</p>
<p>“<em>Please… please spare our lives… please…”</em></p>
<p>When the entire city was crying in a green hue, Joshua shifted his gaze toward me.</p>
<p>“May I stop?”</p>
<p>He had no intention of exterminating everyone in the city.</p>
<p>The battle was over, and there was no value in the land where no one could engage in production activities. Who would dedicate gold for him and his attackers?</p>
<p>“This is your group’s territory now. Do whatever you want with them.”</p>
<p>Then, Joshua gestured towards a city guard and motioned towards the jewelry box, indicating that he wished to retrieve it and for the guard to follow him. The box was buried within a pool of melting bodies.</p>
<p>We returned to the residence where the ruling family of the city had resided for generations. Whatever had emerged from that place and whatever this city had been, it now belonged to the green night and his men.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 369</p>
<p>As foretold, the Doom Man, one of the Demon Kings, appeared to usher in the night. Despite being regarded as a mere legend and only ranking fifth among the six demons recorded by Saint Cassian, he was indeed the devil that had been spoken of.</p>
<p>Saint Cassian’s record was true. Doom Man’s army invaded both time and space, then captured the Franklin Dukedom in just a few days. Their corps was different from the Baclans, Declans, Barbas, and Grafs as they were under the direct control of the Demon King.</p>
<p>Hence, the group was now known as the Demon Corps, and they had now arrived in the Land of Whirlpool within the Xyliver Kingdom. King Lymax, the ruler of the kingdom, was currently having an audience with a woman of low status who had returned alive from the Land of Whirlpool. Despite her status, the king spoke with the utmost respect and chose his words carefully out of deference to Caldoran’s honor.</p>
<p>“Are you sure Duke Caldoran has passed away?”</p>
<p>The Holy Knight family was in control of the Land of Whirlpool as previous kings in accordance with the old tradition. According to her, Caldoran was killed there like his ancestors.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the answer came from a young man kneeling from behind instead of the woman as she had stayed silent.</p>
<p>“That’s what the aristocrats in the city decided, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>He was an illegitimate child, but he had still inherited his father’s sword prowess. Anger and bitterness permeated his speech as he mentioned the city’s nobles.</p>
<p>Upon hearing of the tragedy that had befallen the city, King Lymax signaled his servants in the presence of the woman of low status. She had barely managed to stay in the city thanks to her son, who couldn’t even register his name under his father’s family list even though he had outstanding talents. Thanks to her son, she had been able to survive this time as well.</p>
<p>After the maids helped the woman to walk outside the room, King Lymax said earnestly, “I can’t believe this.”</p>
<p>Caldoran was one of the Holy Knights who had attained the rare rank of Sword Master due to his exceptional combat abilities. Moreover, King Lymax had been informed that his long-time acquaintance, King Onyx, would help him out.</p>
<p>Two Sword Masters had confronted the Demon Corps on the Land of Whirlpool.</p>
<p>“I heard this directly from Your Highness’s guardian knight.”</p>
<p>He was referring to Caldoran’s legitimate child.</p>
<p>The king said, “Tell me more.”</p>
<p>“My father left for the field with King Onyx, accompanied by his guardian knights.”</p>
<p>“Instead of waiting for reinforcements?” King Lymax asked.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. “The Demon Corps was too strong to do that, Your Highness. We had no choice but to move to the field before the city collapsed.”</p>
<p>“I heard there were fewer than one hundred soldiers.”</p>
<p>The memory of that moment left Leo speechless, and a deep sense of terror sent shivers down his spine. It was so intense that it overshadowed even the loss of his highly esteemed father. His eyes filled with dread as terror surged through him. Images of sacred priests battling and succumbing to the deadly mist of the plague, and of over a thousand malevolent spirits taking form, flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>Leo closed his eyes tightly and opened them. Then, he recounted the events from the all-night battle to when Caldoran’s rightful heir returned to the field and shared his experiences. The story of the young warrior unfolded, detailing the point at which the city’s aristocrats surrendered to the Demon King, and concluding with the slaughter of Leo’s family members.</p>
<p>“There’s a reason why we ran to you by avoiding the Demon Corps-occupied areas. It’s not because we have forgotten our desire for revenge. Actually, I want to stay in the city like your guardian knight.”</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>“My father once told me the secret about the family.”</p>
<p>Caldoran had cherished Leo. King Lymax wondered if it was due to the Holy Knight recognizing Leo’s lineage. Given that Caldoran had entrusted Leo with the family secret, it seemed likely to be the case.</p>
<p>Although it was just an honorary position, he would have offered his legitimate kid as King Lymax’s guardian knight. Thus, Caldoran must have intended for Leo to inherit the family. Within the Holy Knight family, the foremost concern was identifying kids who would carry on the Holy Knight bloodline, so there was no preference given to legitimate or illegitimate children, nor any distinction made between gender.</p>
<p>King Lymax viewed Leo in a new light with these considerations in mind. Ultimately, the situation was quite dire as Caldoran had passed away, and his family was on the brink of extinction. King Lymax knew it was possible to gain control of the Holy Knight bloodline, which had consistently contained Sword Masters, by channeling the young warrior’s fury and desire for vengeance against the city’s nobles and the devil.</p>
<p>“I don’t care about the secret. My fury burns for the loss of Caldoran and the suffering you have endured! The corrupt nobility of the city is even more detestable. To honor Caldoran’s spirit, I have no recourse but to deploy my troops and bring their heads to the chopping block.”</p>
<p>“If you do so, then I will dedicate my sword to you, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>King Lymax sensed a weird sensation in Leo’s response.</p>
<p>“I’m going to provide you with my soldiers, too.”</p>
<p>“...Thank you for just saying that.”</p>
<p>Leo’s voice trembled as he suppressed the anger.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I need to take some time to fulfill my father’s will.”</p>
<p>“Do you have any plans?”</p>
<p>“No, but I want to go north.”</p>
<p>“King Gemilan?”</p>
<p>“He is one of the two in my mind.”</p>
<p>“The north is too distant, and it will pose a greater challenge with your mother in tow.”</p>
<p>King Lymax attempted to convince him, but Leo remained resolute in his stance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>King Lymax mused over the secret of Caldoran’s family that Leo, the son of Caldoran’s concubine, had told him.</p>
<p>There were two reasons why Caldoran and his forebears had safeguarded the Land of Whirlpool by assuming the role of its protectors. One was tied to the imminent arrival of the Demon King, which had unfortunately come to pass despite their efforts. The other was related to the Book of Death, which was a black magic tome from the War of New Devil. It was a dangerous dark magic that should never be revealed to the world, let alone to the Barba Corps that harbored necromancers according to Saint Cassian’s record.</p>
<p><em>Did Caldoran have such a thing…</em></p>
<p>King Lymax was furious with Caldoran, and his ire extended to Caldoran’s child, who had departed despite Lymax’s repeated attempts at reconciliation.</p>
<p>Black magic was bound to be a vicious curse. A land overrun by black magic was notorious for its legendary yet nightmarish tales. Most of these stories were recounted by elderly sailors who had been tossed about by the winds and waves, only to find themselves upon the death-ridden continent.</p>
<p>They spoke of encountering the living dead, inescapable situations upon being bitten, and even bodies that appeared to wield mana, with walking skeletons banding together as a squad. The other stories were similar to these.</p>
<p>Even if it was a curse, Caldoran was supposed to use such black magic to prevent the Demon King from entering this world. That was why Lymax was mad at the dead Caldoran. Caldoran ended up choosing his reputation over the crisis of the kingdom. Or he might have believed that he would be able to stop the Demon from coming even without such a curse.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Demon King had arrived, and he overpowered the entire Land of Whirlpool. Everything happened within Lymax’s kingdom, not somewhere else.</p>
<p>When Lymax was lost in thought, the Minister of Court came in a hurry.</p>
<p>“How did it go?” he asked.</p>
<p>The minister grimaced. “It’s not good. It has become more difficult to expect assistance from other kingdoms.”</p>
<p>“Are they under attack as well?”</p>
<p>The man shook his head. “It’s not like that. They said things aren’t urgent enough to dispatch troops, and the unusual activity in the south has caught their attention.”</p>
<p>He was referring to Azadun, the Sword of Desert, which was one of the most powerful kingdoms on the continent known as the ‘South.’</p>
<p>“Your Highness. It seems that Azadun has started to move north.”</p>
<p>It was a distant country considered to be a part of another continent, separated by a strait acting as a boundary. One would only become aware of its existence through the products it produced, but its name was not supposed to be mentioned in the current conversation.</p>
<p>However, Lymax understood why Azadun went to the war of conquest. They were trying to expand their military territory before facing the Demon Corps.</p>
<p>“What about the Atreus Kingdom?” Lymax mentioned the name of another great power. The northward expansion of Azadun was a matter for the southern kingdoms directly confronting them, and Lymax’s focus ought to be on the Atreus Kingdom.</p>
<p>If the Atreus Kingdom began to try conquering neighboring territories, then they would not only be forced to contend with the Demon Corps within, but also face off against Atreus’s soldiers outside, given the shared border.</p>
<p>“Your Highness. King Atreus sent an envoy.”</p>
<p>King Lymax sardonically remarked, “It’s obvious that I don’t have to look into it. He must be telling me to crawl between his crotch.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“You should know better, but your family has a strong grudge against Atresus’s prestigious families. The same goes for our royal family. King Atreues will not recognize the rights of the empire as they are. Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>“But, Your Highness…The Demon King has already penetrated too deep into our kingdom.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just them. Even the incarnation of the Demon King has descended. The future of our kingdom is clearly bleak. However, you and I know that things won’t end even if we sacrifice our fortune to Atreus. I would rather surrender to the Demon than hand our kingdom over to Atreus. The Demon might recognize us as what we are now, right?”</p>
<p>The minister protested, “Your Highness! Our Lord Lacryma is listening to us.”</p>
<p>The king snorted. “The Lord’s punishment is not something that I should fear. Rather, those who refused my aid out of cowardice, and those like Atreus who have used the current situation as a pretext for starting a war, ought to be the ones concerned. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“If you are saying that we should surrender to the Demon… We should consider after watching more of what is going on in the city of Caldoran.”</p>
<p>“Do you truly believe that we would simply surrender to the Demon? Although the Land of Whirlpool is within my realm, Caldoran was responsible for it. He may have fallen, but you and I have yet to even begin. Let me be clear about my intentions. I desire to retake Caldoran’s city and drive the Demon out of our borders. If the Cabinet has a different approach in mind, I shall respect their decision.”</p>
<p>“Your Highness… Our wills are the same as yours, but…” the minister hesitated.</p>
<p>The king looked at him. “But?”</p>
<p>“The Land of Whirlpool is where two Sword Masters, Caldoran and King Onyx, were killed.”</p>
<p>“You must be thinking of the same name that I am. I want to hire the King of Mercenaries. His royal wealth alone is not enough, so he desperately needs the support of you and other ministers.”</p>
<p>“However… He is a man of endless greed. You know what catastrophe many kingdoms faced when they invited him and his corps.”</p>
<p>King Lymax sighed. “Regardless of the outcome, both you and I would have to grovel at Atreus’s feet. I have made my intentions clear, and as I previously stated, I shall honor whatever decision the Cabinet makes. I hope that you, too, will respect my wishes.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Highness.”</p>
<p>Lymax added after much consideration, “Tell only those you trust. There is the Book of Death in the city of Caldoran. There is no doubt that I had heard this from his son. If we can secure it, then we will be able to regain more than we will lose to the King of Mercenaries.”</p>
<p>As expected, the king observed a glimmer of fascination in the minister’s eyes upon hearing the blood-soaked legend, rather than shock at the obscure name.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 370</p>
<p>The city’s nobles appeared to have discovered the hole in the damaged wall that perfectly fit the jewelry box while rummaging through Caldoran’s bedroom. Although the box lacked any inherent power, its ability to withstand the plague was attributed to an ancient book that was stored within it. This book contained the concentrated essence of the Barba Corps, so it was unsurprising that the box was able to endure the plague.</p>
<p>[The Book of Death, Volume 2 (Item)</p>
<p>It’s one of the three black magic books created by the power of Doom Entegasto.</p>
<p>Item Class: S</p>
<p>Item Level: 620</p>
<p>Effect: If you merge your will with the item while in possession of it, you can access its inherent power. ]</p>
<p>Odin’s Golden Armor was the most powerful item I had, and the Book of Death was at the same level. It was in the same category as the Book of Death, Volume 1 that the commander-in-chief of the Barba Corps had held in the Final Stage of the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>At that time, I gave Joshua a clear order to secure it. I also tasked the leader of the Lunea Clan, who was a devotee of Doom Dejire, with acquiring the key equipment of the Seven Demon King’s Corps, such as the Book of Death. In exchange for a ceasefire in our war against the Seven Demon kings, they agreed to provide us with the equipment, but they had yet to fulfill their promise, using the chaos of the current situation as an excuse.</p>
<p>“Was it this?” Joshua recalled that moment as well.</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to see it here. It’s the second volume.”</p>
<p>When I gestured at the jewelry box with my chin, he answered calmly, “Master, this is what you have been looking for all this time.”</p>
<p>“Not entirely.”</p>
<p>I touched the book as Joshua didn’t reach to pick it up himself. As I made contact with the book, a crimson energy began to surge up my hand, creeping along the tips of my fingers.</p>
<p>Right then, something felt unpleasant. It came from the power that was confined within me instead of from my personal emotions. I could feel the movement of something wriggling deep in my body and resisting the scarlet energy.</p>
<p>I had not gone through this phenomenon upon completing Doom Entegasto’s Life Vessel. The calculated figure representing the Old One's power was absorbed, and it seemed to have dissipated naturally. I began to question if this was the reason for the opposition to the power of the Dooms.</p>
<p>I decided to observe the situation for now. The blood color energy didn’t advance further into my body after it came up to my wrist. At that time, the reality of the mass of power I had was showing up for the first time. Interestingly, it was colored gold as if it had read my attributes.</p>
<p>The gold hue blocked the red light from going above my wrist, but it hadn’t done so through my own volition. Instead, the golden power had its own will. It appeared like that and eventually swept the blood-red energy and spread throughout my body.</p>
<p>Right after the golden power pushed away the last bit of blood-colored energy I realized that they were of opposing attributes as they attacked first as soon as they found each other.</p>
<p><strong>[Would you like to purify your possessions? (Power Consumed: 300)]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[* It does not affect the skills left in the book.]</strong></p>
<p>The notification message was coming from somewhere that Doom Kaos had created, and it appeared as if it was inciting a fight with Doom Entegasto. I had no need to be concerned as I had secured its Life Vessel, so it would have had a grudge against me regardless. If I ran into it one day, it would threaten me in an attempt to get his stuff back.</p>
<p><strong>[You have secured the common power ‘Purification.’]</strong></p>
<p>Another way to use the common power had opened as if Doom Kaos had read my mind. Although it was titled ‘purification,’ it was actually device that triggered a conflict between Dooms. This was one of Doom Kaos’s ways of governing his monarchs, but it was pleasing to me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>[You have used Purification.]</strong></p>
<p>The golden energy slipped out all at once and filled the entire room. Previously, when my priests had conducted the ritual, the sounds of laughter, screaming, and crying that emanated from the sacrifices were not mere auditory hallucinations. Similarly, the screams recorded in the book were also real.</p>
<p>The screams resembled those of women whose voices had been torn apart. The torn curtains began to shake violently, and then they were ripped off completely. Joshua’s robe also flapped in the wind.</p>
<p>The moment when Purification ended, the screams and my golden energy disappeared. Then, a notification message appeared.</p>
<p><strong>[Purification has been completed.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Power 77 / 380]</strong></p>
<p>[The Book of Death, Volume 2 (Item)</p>
<p>It’s a black magic book with the power of Doom Man.</p>
<p>Item Class: S</p>
<p>Item Level: 620</p>
<p>Effect: If you merge your will with the item while in possession of it, you can access its inherent power. ]</p>
<p>The phrase “created by the power of Doom Entegasto” had been revised after Purification. The Awakened couldn’t display their status windows anymore as the system had evaporated, but they had no problem using their remaining skills. Therefore, Joshua was able to check the edited phrase through Night Eye.</p>
<p>When I picked up the book again, I no longer felt something eerie. Instead, the book was busy giving off a charming sensation as if it was a lump of power that was crying out to me to use it.</p>
<p>Now I knew what the second Book of Death dealt with. There was a reason why it was at the highest level. Although there was a restriction on it, making it such that the user was supposed to possess it in advance, the completed skills and power in it were enough to make an Awakened in the Bronze section jump into the Challenger section immediately.</p>
<p>If Joshua took this, then the owner of the Green Night would be able to secure another ownership of the Bloody Night. I couldn’t help but feel a sense of happiness. This would serve as a fitting compensation for the loss of his squad members.</p>
<p>I handed Joshua the book, swallowing what I wanted to tell him for greater joy. A civilian or a low-level Awakened would have dropped the book, twisting its spine, as soon as they came into contact with the book, but all Joshua did was frown slightly.</p>
<p>He looked at me to get confirmation. By nodding, the process of linking Joshua and the Book of Death began. Despite the frightening title of the book, it transformed into a golden light and started to climb up Joshua’s hands. Then, he burst into a scream for a second as if the light was strangling him. He twitched his nose as he looked down at the back of his hand as if he felt a change within him.</p>
<p>His nails used to be quite long and resembled rotten branches, but they were now shrinking. The scabs that had been hardened on his fingers were also falling off like crumbs. Other than the fact that his nails were still green, his fingers now resembled a normal old man’s. The skin where scabs had fallen off was still wrinkled and shriveled. However, the sight of his hands returning to a human-like appearance brought tears to his eyes.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the end of it as changes were occurring on his neck and face that were still hidden in his hood. Joshua pulled it off and picked up a broken piece of mirror. The large green scab beneath his left eye, which extended to the lower part of his chin, was much more prominent than the other small, wrinkled scabs on his opposite cheek. However, even that had fallen off as well.</p>
<p>The scabs on his right cheek also fell out with stiff hair. His skin was wrinkled and scarred, making him appear decades older than his actual age. Furthermore, his thin arms lacked any fat, giving him the appearance of an elderly man.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Joshua couldn’t take his eyes off the face in the mirror. He was satisfied.</p>
<p>“I’ll go downstairs and check.”</p>
<p>His voice trembled with joy because he knew this wasn’t the end of his change. He needed another offering to complete his second transformation.</p>
<p>When Joshua stepped out of Caldoran’s bedroom, I heard a woman’s scream. She was one of the noble ladies in the city who was seeking our mercy even in this situation.</p>
<p>The aristocrats were all gathered in the hall. Upon arriving there, Joshua was hugging the lady’s waist with one hand and sucking her neck with his teeth embedded in her flesh. Unlike what one would expect after hearing a scream, the lady was acting as if she was in ecstasy.</p>
<p>Her eyes were wide open as she gazed at the chandelier on the ceiling with her head bent back, and they were dilated. She was clearly entranced by the strong stimulus coursing through her. In addition, the sound of her quickened breaths made it feel like she was having the best sex of her life.</p>
<p>When Joshua had suddenly descended and bit into the woman, the other aristocrats had already fled in a panicked frenzy. The hall was empty, so there were only three of us.</p>
<p>I sat on the red-carpeted stairs and applauded to celebrate the return of the real Joshua. His arms, which had been so skinny that they resembled skin-covered bones, were now rapidly gaining flesh, and his wrinkled skin was becoming smooth. His previously bald scalp was now filled with the lush blond hair he used to have. His necromancer’s robe was gloomy, but as soon as Joshua regained his old good-looking face, it gave off a stylish tuxedo vibe.</p>
<p>The lady was young and pretty, so the two tangled in the center of the hall looked like a nice couple at first glance.</p>
<p>When Joshua took his mouth off the girl’s neck, I saw that his face was smeared completely with blood. He then wiped his mouth with the same hand that had been hugging the girl’s waist, but there were still some remaining bloodstains on his lips, which looked like lipstick.</p>
<p>I clapped my hands again because I remembered the old days when he had knelt down before me and called me master for the first time. Now, he was currently doing the exact same thing with the same expression on his face.</p>
<p>What should I call him now? Vampire Lord who also deals with the plague?</p>
<p>I commanded, “You can take off that robe now.”</p>
<p>His eyes flashed with gratitude. “Thank you… Thank you, Master.”</p>
<p>I considered finding Caldoran’s tailcoat to dress him up, but he already looked great without one. However, it was imperative that he never lose the Book of Death, for if he did, the plague’s vicious wrath would once again penetrate his skin.</p>
<p>Joshua hurriedly asked me as I was about to leave, “Are you going back to the mainland[1]?”</p>
<p>Other than the energy of the plague tinting his eyes green, he truly looked like the way he did before he had entered the Stage of Advent. I saw my reflection in his eyes, and I was smiling contentedly.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “It’s too early to do that. I will move your squad members over here and continue their treatment.”</p>
<p>Whether it was an item left by the Old One or a cursed item with the power of another Doom, it was my turn.</p>
<p>As I turned around, the last thing I saw was Joshua’s face, which appeared somewhat entranced, and the woman who had been lying down on the ground as if she was dead, rising up to show me her gratitude.</p>
<p>At that time, a new message popped up.</p>
<p><strong>[Your priest, Osiris, has succeeded the Old Vampire Corps.]</strong></p>
<p>Yes, this was what I wanted!</p>
<p>1. Earth ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 371</p>
<p>There was something that was traveling at high speed in the far-off sky, but it wasn’t a creature. Instead, Seong-Il discovered that it was a drone conducting mapping operations[1], and it was hovering from the other side of the hill. Right when he was debating whether to destroy it or leave it alone, it disappeared from his line of sight. Therefore, he forgot about it, but it appeared that the drone had revealed the situation in the tower.</p>
<p>Later on, Seong-Il was pouring some piping hot water into the cup noodles as he was hungry. He pressed the lid of the container down with wooden chopsticks, then looked at the group who approached him. The leader was someone familiar to him.</p>
<p>He raised a hand in greeting. “Yo, long time no see. Kim Ji-Hoon!”</p>
<p>“Hi, how have you been?” the other man responded genially.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon was accompanied by mercenaries along with some other foreign Awakened. Then, they looked around. After seeing that Seong-Il was not equipped with any weapons, they relaxed perceptibly.</p>
<p>“Did you do that?” Seong-Il asked, glancing at the smoke rising from beyond the hill. Kim Ji-Hoon was looking at Seong-Il and the boundary around the tower behind him.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon nodded. “We struggled a bit. The magic trap was tricky to get rid of.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il grinned. “Haha. Mary is taking care of all the strong ones around here, so you only had to deal with the weak ones. You shouldn’t have had a hard time with them, buddy.”</p>
<p>“There are ones stronger than them?” Kim Ji-Hoon asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il pointed. “Look at all these. They make things like this.”</p>
<p>Even from Kim Ji-Hoon’s point of view, the boundary seemed as solid as the one in Act Two, Stage One.</p>
<p>“Is Ms. Mary here?” he finally asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il commented, “It has been a while.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s environment was filled with disposable waste, and there was a secluded area behind some bushes where he relieved himself. Based on that, Kim Ji-Hoon could infer that Seong-Il had been residing in that location and consuming meals there for quite some time.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon stared at the boundary. It was impossible to check inside due to the blue curtain, but considering that Mary had to step up for herself, there would have been ‘him,’ too. Holy Knight Ronsius.</p>
<p><em>[Class: D</em></p>
<p><em>Location: Ronsius Holy Knight (Franklin Dukedom, Greenwood Continent)]</em></p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon recalled the passage that he had entered from earlier. The information pertained to a series of passages that functioned as exits on the outskirts of the city.</p>
<p>The association provided private companies with details on multiple levels of passageways that were in the same vicinity as Holy Knight Ronsius, ranging from F to B. The B passageway, the highest level among them, was believed to lead to the area that was protected by the boundary that directly connected to the existence of the Holy Knight.</p>
<p>That was the difference from the dungeons in the Stage of Advent, so it was more accurate to call it ‘passageway’ instead of ‘dungeon.’ If Kim Ji-Hoon were to enter the D-class passageway and eliminate any immediate threats, then he would still be accountable for dealing with potential dangers in higher level passageways if they were not resolved beforehand.</p>
<p>If Mary hadn’t held on to Holy Knight Ronsius, then he would have come to help his city.</p>
<p>Seong-Il suddenly asked, “But why didn’t you head directly to the duchy? They must have more to eat there since they are the capital city.”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon became speechless as if Seong-Il had grasped his intention. Although he received many offers from major companies, he decided to join the Ilsung Group based on his trust in the CEO, Lee Tae-Han. However, it turned out that the Ilsung Group had limited influence in the association due to the president’s complete withdrawal from the company and transfer of authority to his sister.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon responded, “RMC (Rothschild Military Company) is there.”</p>
<p>“Did they take over the capital city?” Seong-Il asked, eyebrow quirking.</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il guffawed. “Haha.”</p>
<p>“Who knew this would happen?” Kim Ji-Hoon sighed.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head. “Ah, you made a mistake by going the wrong place, bro.”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon introduced Seong-Il to his team using fluent English, but they were already aware of the other person’s status. The mercenaries paid tribute from a distance, and his squad members saluted at a distance closer to him.</p>
<p>Seong-Il casually waved a hand at them and opened the lid. The noodles were as mushy as he liked.</p>
<p>“Do you want a bite?” he offered.</p>
<p>Even when skilled shooters wielded automatic rifles, the bullets would inevitably fire in two or three bursts, as if being abruptly cut off. The source of the sound wasn’t from the city, but rather from the western hill where the drone had previously flown.</p>
<p>Seong-Il placed another container on the pile and directed his eyes toward the source of the sound as he asked, “Don’t you need to go? We don’t need any support here.”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon said, “The other groups are probably wrapping up. You know, those soldiers. The city is huge and the population is large, so we have to make sure that we clean up the mess.”</p>
<p>“How much do you earn from this?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon shrugged. “I don’t know yet because there is a stake issue with the groups that have entered later. But our team’s stake is much more, so I will get a lot.”</p>
<p>“Hm, then how much roughly?”</p>
<p>“Six percent of the spoils are mine.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s eyebrows went up. “Six percent?”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon explained. “There are a lot of groups that joined after me. But I have the highest percentage. Haha. To be exact, our group gets thirty percent, then I take twenty percent from it. That’s how it works. In addition, I get an annual salary separately from Ilsung Group.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il commented. “I don’t know if it’s a lot or not.”</p>
<p>“It’s enough that I don’t need to be worried about money throughout my entire life. I just consider it as a pension. I’m responsible for six percent of the revenue generated in the city. Well, it’s just the beginning.”</p>
<p>No movement had been detected, but Seong-Il still widened his eyes as he checked the boundaries of the tower. It was a habit of his.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?” Ji-Hoon asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il nodded absently. “Yeah. So, they keep distributing you the profits? That’s another story, then. It’s a jackpot!”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon grinned. “That’s why everyone jumps in, risking their lives. Mr. Caliber, you should take part.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shrugged. “I am planning to do that after I complete this operation. Well, I don’t know if there will be anything left at that time.”</p>
<p>“The Franklin Duchy is considered a tiny place in this continent, and the whole area will be under you and Ms. Mary.”</p>
<p>“This is in the heart of mountains rising one above another.”</p>
<p>“It’s a B-class entry point. Wouldn’t there be something left?” Ji-Hoon asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il pointed. “There is also a tower of wizards. Over there.”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon explained, “What do you think is in there? You and Ms. Mary will be able to earn the same amount that I will be getting throughout my entire life all at once. The association said they will soon create an item trading system. When you conquer the passageway, retrieve everything you can and leave out those you are going to use.”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon then continued, “Mr. Caliber. You might not face much danger, but many people have died, not just mercenaries but also some Awakened. Unless you gain experience, the Awakened will keep fighting a stronger armed force. Don’t you think it’s remarkable? I should join a higher class next time. Please let me know if there is an association operation. We only get one chance at life.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il guffawed. “Hahaha. You are so funny. You only say the things that sound nice to other people. Yes, that’s your talent.”</p>
<p>On the Stage of Advent, Ji-Hoon wasn’t someone who would have said such a thing. He only used the excuse of being in Ilsung as a reason to enter the low-class passageway, even though he was capable of targeting much higher levels.</p>
<p>However, Seong-Il didn’t hate him as Ji-Hoon was one of the few comrades he was familiar with who was still alive.</p>
<p>Seong-Il smiled. “Anyway, you don’t need to help me here.”</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon smiled back. “I just wanted to chat with you. As I said, I’m done with my work.”</p>
<p>“Ah, good for you. Do you just have to wait for the distribution?”</p>
<p>The other man nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“Then, why don’t you head home?” Seong-Il suggested.</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon’s eyes flickered. “I have something to tell you.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il couldn’t understand as Ji-Hoon spoke in fluent English again to his men.</p>
<p>When Seong-Il was smacking his lips with envy, a foreign Awakened handed a military laptop to Ji-Hoon. Then, Ji-Hoon took out an SD card from his pocket and said while plugging it into the laptop, “This is an image mapped by another group, and three forces were found here. It is copied from the drone that we could only recover, so as you can see…”</p>
<p>“Mapped?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon explained, “It’s how a drone flies around and makes a map of the area.”</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s a hell of a nice world.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il was amazed by the 3D topographical features on the laptop monitor.</p>
<p>When Ji-Hoon clicked on the keypad a few times, the military force he talked about began to overlap on the map. It was quite detailed as if they were watching the march of a large army from above.</p>
<p>In fact, the front and rear perspectives were shifting according to Ji-Hoon’s manipulation. The troops were so huge that they filled the ridge.</p>
<p>“Are you saying all of them are coming here?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>“We haven’t touched them yet.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il narrowed his eyes. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon confessed, “I don’t think they are heading here.”</p>
<p>“Can you enlarge it more? I want to see the leader’s face.”</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon continued, “At least one of the drones may have approached him closely, but it must have been destroyed immediately. However, none of them seem to have the ability to shoot down high-flying drones.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>
<p>“We are keeping an eye on them because they might change direction out of nowhere. If they make a turn, then they will pour in here.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il grumbled, “That will be so annoying, but I’m tied up here, so I can’t help you with anything.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s all good. I just wanted to let you know because a few of them appeared to be strong.”</p>
<p>“They don’t care about this place even though they are under our attack? I guess they are only taking care of themselves.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Who do you think they are?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon responded, “We are guessing that they are a group of mercenaries.”</p>
<p>“But there are so many of them.”</p>
<p>“There are over one million, but it’s not the numbers that matter…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il interrupted, “The only important thing is their leader, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il complimented, “Good thing that you didn’t touch them. This is Mary’s operation area.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. But only we are taking steps back.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by ‘we?”</p>
<p>Ji-Hoon clarified, “Those who are in solidarity with the Ilsung Group, so the city’s ruling groups. However, the other groups’ occupied territories are in their direction. So I don’t know what they will do.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shrugged. “It can’t be helped. I’d like to check who they are, but…this area is more important for me to protect. Watch carefully and let me know if something comes up. For example, report when they turn towards me…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il abruptly stopped and turned his head quickly. The boundary was finally disappearing.</p>
<p>“Noona?” he called out.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said with an exhausted face, “Wizards are annoying. Are there any others around that I should deal with?”</p>
<p>“Pardon me?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>She clarified, “Like the strong ones. Well, except for wizards.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Demon Corps were split into two distinct groups. One consisted of knights who were skilled in the use of Mana, while the other comprised individuals who lacked such abilities but possessed potent explosive weapons.</p>
<p>Onir was standing on top of a Demon Corps soldier who was barely alive. Onir was surprised to see that the soldier possessed the ability to use Mana equivalent to that of a mid-level Sword Expert, despite not being a warrior. Although the soldier used magic, he didn’t exhibit any movement of Mana, leading Onir to believe that he might be a type of wizard.</p>
<p>He was displaying an ability that didn't make logical sense, and he also had outstanding swordsmanship. In addition, he was armed with five-star artifacts that were equivalent to ancient relics, but it was hard to say if they were sacred objects of Lord Lacryma.</p>
<p>“Are you going to stay like that?” he asked tauntingly.</p>
<p>Onir increased the pressure on the knight’s body under his foot, causing the knight’s eyes to bulge and his ribs to crack. Suddenly, a thread vein in the knight’s eye burst, resulting in a scream that pierced the air.</p>
<p>“Good thing that you feel pain.”</p>
<p>Onir nodded towards one of the men who was laughing with him, using his chin as a gesture. The guy grasped Onir’s intention and poured a high-level healing potion on the knight.</p>
<p>The knight’s eyes were quickly recovered, but he looked like he was shedding bloody tears as the veins had burst already.</p>
<p>At that point Onir took his foot off the body of the knight, and the men who were laughing at the knight stepped back while creating a circular formation. Onir looked around them and pointed at a man.</p>
<p>He was the one who would compete with the knight with a sword.</p>
<p>He commanded, “Don’t use too much power on him.”</p>
<p>Onir sat on the chair after giving orders, then signaled to start the battle.</p>
<p>The result was as Onir expected. The physical abilities of the knight weren’t greatly influenced by Mana, and it was to such an extent that he suspected that he was born with it. However, it was clear that he was restricted in using magic and forming a barrier.</p>
<p>He struggled to connect the same type of magic, and the attributes of the magic he used didn’t match, causing him to have difficulty focusing. Additionally, some of the magics were of a high level while others were lower, making it difficult for Onir to determine his level. The Demon Corps were literally born out of chaos.</p>
<p>The only thing worth watching was the knight’s swordsmanship. It appeared that he was experienced, but it was no use when he was faced with a traditional swordsman in Onir’s group.</p>
<p>As Onir’s subordinate fought, he kept glancing at Onir’s face. When Onir lowered his thumb, the subordinate’s blade moved so quickly that the knight couldn’t even react in time. The knight failed to anticipate the traditional swordsmanship techniques used by the subordinate and was decapitated instantly.</p>
<p><em>Shing-!</em></p>
<p>Then, a small cheer burst out as the fight was being held where the villagers had gathered. More than a thousand households were under the rule of the Demon Corps.</p>
<p>Onir’s subordinate asked while looking at the residence, “What should we do?”</p>
<p>His soldiers were waiting for his order.</p>
<p>He casually responded, “Kill all of them.”</p>
<p>As the soldiers charged towards the villagers with loud cries, the villagers finally recognized that they were not there to defeat the Demon Corps, but were actually more vicious than the demons themselves.</p>
<p>The brutal slaughter, rape, and plunder began. Onir put his hand on his jaw as he observed his soldiers wielding swords against the village men and snatching at the hair of the village women.</p>
<p>He wondered if it would be better to stay here and engulf the Franklin Duchy instead of rushing towards the Demon’s Incarnation. Ronsius, who acted like the guardian of the duchy, was clearly stranded as he had confronted the Demon Corps.</p>
<p><em>I might be able to take Ronsius’s tower too.</em></p>
<p>It was easy to make a decision. There was no need to take care of King Lymax and the nobles of the Xyliver Kingdom. He opted to delay their arrival by touring the surroundings, providing meals to his men, and resting on Ronsius’s bed.</p>
<p>Onir felt that this world was ideal for him when he witnessed the flames rising from the village. As long as there were no survivors, the Demon Corps would be blamed for everything, regardless of how much his group looted and killed. He could avoid getting involved in the politics of the Holy Knights.</p>
<p><em>Sheek-!</em></p>
<p>Right then, he sensed something. Onir turned reflexively, but the one that flew in was one beat faster than him. It was the body of his subordinate. He didn’t know if the body was torn under the pressure while flying, or if it had been ripped apart from the very beginning.</p>
<p>Onir’s vision was obscured by the blood coming out from the corpse.</p>
<p>However, he clearly felt the sense that something was sprinting towards him with heavy footsteps.</p>
<p><em>A Sword Master?</em></p>
<p>When he widened his eyes, he saw a giant holding a subordinate in each hand. Then, he saw a small woman standing with her arms crossed behind the giant. The woman was standing among her soldiers, but for some reason, her subordinates weren’t aware of her.</p>
<p>Then, Onir realized that these two were commanders of the Demon Corps.</p>
<p>There was only one name that crossed his mind, Ronsius. Onir had originally planned to kill him and loot his tower, but now he was in dire need of that man’s help.</p>
<p>A thunderstorm then broke out in the near sky. A distinct flash of light and a gigantic thunderbolt overwhelmed the sky. It was definitely a powerful blitz magic, not a natural phenomenon. There was only one person in the neighborhood who could exert such power.</p>
<p>Onir screamed, “I am here, Ronsius!!!”</p>
<p>1. Using a drone to create a detailed and accurate map of an area. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 372</p>
<p>Onir soon came to realize his mistake as he observed the magical phenomenon before him. Though the guy appeared to possess the intense power of Lightning Nova, its flexible movements gave off a vibe that it contained spirit inside.</p>
<p>Moreover, Onir couldn’t sense the typical surge of Mana that accompanied the use of ultimate magic. Most notably, the destructive force that was being unleashed with each strike of lightning far surpassed that of Lightning Nova.</p>
<p>The short moment made Onir wonder if the user of such magic was the reincarnation of the King of Lightning, who had passed away a long time ago. Right when the guy’s thunderbolt was sweeping Onir’s soldiers into a handful of ashes, Seong-Il rushed in.</p>
<p><strong>“You fucking asshole! You are now going against me!”</strong></p>
<p>Onir quickly came to a conclusion.</p>
<p>The opponent’s attack strategy was similar to that of a bard's[1], but instead of playing an instrument to produce sound, he projected his voice. Sound waves were powerful, but Onir believed it was not enough to stop him.</p>
<p>He recalled a tactic that could cut through the sound waves and unleashed a series of attacks against Seong-Il. Following that, he reversed the flow of Mana inside his body from bottom to top. Onir’s Mana Blade revealed itself to the world with various colors.</p>
<p>The Mana Blade cut off Seong-Il’s skill at a tilted angle.</p>
<p><em>Oh? You are stopping me?</em></p>
<p>Seong-Il put the brakes on the force as he threw himself forward.</p>
<p>Following that, Seong-Il hurled Karail, one of Onir’s subordinates, towards the Mana Blade. He specifically chose Karail due to his impressive physique. Seong-Il assumed that Karail’s shield, which was made from C-class items, would be able to endure for a considerable amount of time.</p>
<p>Seong-Il swung Karail from top to bottom toward the sharp energy that rose obliquely from the blade.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>The impact generated immense pressure that collided into them. They both resisted getting damage and unleashed another series of attacks against each other while they allowed the pressure of backlash to propel them away from each other, creating some distance.</p>
<p><em>I didn’t expect that he would use Karail as a weapon. This is too wild.</em></p>
<p><em>You canceled your last skill and now attack me instead? Yes, I agree that you are pretty strong.</em></p>
<p>Seong-Il checked the protective barrier of the weapon he was holding with his right hand. Each time Karail winced in pain, his shield, having lost one layer, briefly glimmered.</p>
<p>“P…please… spare my life…” another person gasped.</p>
<p>It came from another weapon in Seong-Il’s left hand, not from Karail.</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s eyes abruptly turned red as he locked his gaze on Onir, who reciprocated with a similar glare, and they both charged toward each other again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and I were of the same mind. We both believed that Seong-Il needed more experience in this world.</p>
<p>Seong-Il and Onir had destroyed the entire town, and the battlefield was moved several times following the destruction. I had already eliminated a large number of Onir’s soldiers, but to be precise, more people were killed in the fight between the two.</p>
<p>Onir had the equivalent power as an Awakened in the challenger section, and he was known as a Sword Master here. However, considering that he hadn’t turned into a Dragorin even if he faced me, he hadn’t succeeded in the bloodline of the Ancient Dragon.</p>
<p>Well… That wasn’t common.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee interjected, “The direction of a Mana Blade’s strike is not dictated by the user’s physical motion. Instead, it is determined by the flow of Mana established in the prior usage. Therefore, deciding the flow of mana should be the priority, and swinging the sword should be something that comes naturally afterward.”</p>
<p>She paused before continuing, “The flow of Mana is akin to a living organism, and it requires careful examination to determine the optimal approach. Moreover, subdividing the flow of Mana can significantly affect the proficiency of traditional swordsmanship. At least, that’s what Ronsius thinks.”</p>
<p>The situation was already over when I arrived at the tower to find Yeon-Hee. The wizards were all dead, and a corpse that appeared to be Ronsius’s was still bleeding from all the orifices in his body.</p>
<p>“What about Ronsius?” I asked.</p>
<p>She grimaced. “I failed. He knew how to defend his mind. He chose to die rather than be controlled by me. I put lots of effort into him, but it’s fucked up now.”</p>
<p>I consoled her, “I think you have gotten other information, though.”</p>
<p>She frowned. “I…wanted him. I got greedy.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked at the guy fighting with Seong-Il while continuing to frown. It was hard to describe the fight between the two with the terms ‘power’ and ‘technology.’ Seong-Il had gained tactical experience through battles, but not to the extent of his opponent.</p>
<p>The guy’s skills were delicate despite his threatening appearance. Furthermore, judging by how the strands of Mana Blades burst out and passed through Seong-Il, he knew how to concentrate his power.</p>
<p>“He must be around Level 490, right? Mostly focused on Agility.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was correct. Despite his relatively low level, he had the ability to confront Seong-Il, who was at a significantly higher level of over five hundred. Although there was a wall that couldn’t be crossed between Jonathan, ranked fourth in the world, and Seong-Il, ranked fifth, it was clear that Seong-Il should have been faring better with this guy.</p>
<p>When the two smashed another house, I could see fragments of wood flying over towards me. After burning them into ashes, I listened to Yeon-Hee as she continued, “Using Ronsius’s memories, I followed how wizards are trained.”</p>
<p>As the battle’s wind pressure ruffled her hair, her voice indicated a sense of defeat, lacking the confidence she once exuded when claiming her return as a Grand Wizard.</p>
<p>She grumbled, “We might have been born with an incapability to handle Mana. Every time I try to feel nature’s Mana, I only get headaches instead of a mysterious sensation.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il managed to avoid the opponent’s sword. Then he wielded his weapon at the guy’s ankle and threw him to the ground.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>A Mana Blade had been aimed at Seong-Il’s neck, forcing him to drop his target at the very last moment. Then, a light scattered over the distant sky as it passed by Seong-Il’s neck.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee winked at the light that permeated the air with five colors. She was telling me that it was Mana.</p>
<p>“We cannot handle Mana?” I asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee explained, “Mana is the essence that Lord Lacryma breathed into Mother Nature, and prophets can even discern its will. This implies that Mana serves as a tool for the Old One to protect this region and itself. However, I sense that the Old One is currently rejecting us.”</p>
<p>I pointed out, “However, it’s true that the power that makes us superhumans exists inside of our bodies.”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “It’s sad, but that’s it. This must be run by the System that the Old One created during the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>“That was why I wondered if there would be a solution to this problem if I looked into Ronsius’s memory. We can’t follow their ways, but they can find new ways to fight in the future. To do so…”</p>
<p>The Grand Wizards knew how to resist Yeon-Hee, which was to commit suicide.</p>
<p>“We need to find or convert someone into a renegade,” Yeon-Hee finished her sentence</p>
<p>However, the man who was fighting Seong-Il wasn’t a Grand Wizard.</p>
<p>“Then, why is Seong-Il dealing with him?” I asked.</p>
<p>She replied, “There is something to check before I find a renegade. Warriors have a distinct way of manipulating Mana compared to wizards. It’s akin to the way some of us employ magic, as we don’t create and utilize enchanted vessels as wizards do. Instead, it appears to be distributed throughout the body, maybe?”</p>
<p>I admitted, “I honestly can’t grasp what is going on as I don’t know anything about what you saw from Ronsius.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “So I want you to come with me this time. I will open up the way.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t the power of Doom Man impact our target’s mental system?”</p>
<p>She shrugged casually. “It’s okay. His mental state will be the only thing that will be devastated.”</p>
<p>“Right now?” I asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “No, let’s do it after he gets beaten up a little bit more by Seong-Il. I should have caused physical harm to Ronsius before attacking his mental state. I regret that now. I should have targeted his physical body first. Shit.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I came to find Yeon-Hee not only because I was worried about her, but also because I wanted to chase the remaining powers in this world by exploring the memories extracted from Ronsius. I was curious to learn about the individuals who possessed the supposedly sacred objects of Lacryma, and those who safeguarded the cursed artifacts from the New Devil War, like what Caldoran used to do.</p>
<p>“Are you busy? Did you get any new commands?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. “Yes, there is, but there is no time limit.”</p>
<p>I explained the new orders I got and Dragorin. Yeon-Hee replied that she hadn’t seen such memories from Ronsius.</p>
<p>“Its power was equivalent to the Ender section Awakened? The Old One must be very determined…” she mused.</p>
<p>“Why do you think so?”</p>
<p>She explained her thoughts, “The Ancient Dragons aren’t the only ones we should be wary of. There are also transcendent beings such as the King of Lightning and King of the Ocean here.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to hear something like that.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee then concluded, “Anyway, I don’t think you should take care of things like Dragorin. I can deal with them.”</p>
<p>I reminded her, “But you should go back to the mainland after finishing this operation.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “That is true. Okay, then. I will explain to you more of what I saw in that guy’s mental world.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, if that’s possible.”</p>
<p>“It will be a good chance for you to learn their language. You will see what I mean, okay?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>Even in the past, the most intense battles between the powerful always took place after their shields had been shattered. Seong-Il’s altercation with his opponent was at its peak.</p>
<p><strong>“Go to hell-!”</strong></p>
<p>Shortly after, I witnessed the guy's entire body being jolted by a loud impact. Although he couldn't overpower Seong-Il's technique, he also failed to anticipate the timing.</p>
<p>As the guy attempted to regain his balance mid-air, Seong-Il relentlessly pursued him and struck him forcefully on the back with his fists. The guy tumbled to the ground and rebounded with elasticity. Seong-Il then seized his ankle and relentlessly battered him on the ground, displaying a resolute determination not to squander the opportunity to emerge victorious.</p>
<p>The guy didn’t even scream as he was trying everything he could to escape from Seong-Il’s vice grip. Nonetheless, he was once again thrown off-balance when Seong-Il slammed him onto the ground. Despite the guy’s usual ability to withstand the force of the wind in his normal state, his condition was now dire.</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang! Bang!</em></p>
<p>Seong-Il’s frenzied strikes against him on the ground were becoming increasingly rapid.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee jumped up and said, “Don’t kill him, Seong-Il.”</p>
<p>Finally, Seong-Il released the guy’s ankle from his hand. Then, he gasped with both hands on his knees after flipping the guy upside down with his foot. With every breath, blood poured out of Seong-Il’s mouth into the guy’s body.</p>
<p>“Noona.” Seong-Il looked up at Yeon-Hee and said as if he was complaining, “Give him to me, Noona… Can’t you make him loyal to me? I want to use him as my main skill.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il vomited more blood and collapsed on the land where the monsters seemed to have gone on a rampage.</p>
<p>“Are you a pervert?” Yeon-Hee asked out of exasperation.</p>
<p>Seong-Il began to giggle. “...Hehe.”</p>
<p>She then relented, “But you have beaten up pretty well. I will try.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Noona.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il said that multiple times as Mary’s Touch quickly healed his torn muscles. Then, Yeon-Hee opened the guy’s eye with one hand and looked at me.</p>
<p>“Are you ready to go in?” she asked.</p>
<p>Then, she added, “But it’s funny. This guy actually believed that he could defeat you. These guys don’t understand what’s going on here.”</p>

<p>Chapter 373</p>
<p>“Welcome to Onir’s mental world. I’m greeting you on behalf of him, hehe.”</p>
<p>It felt as if I had traveled back in time in this world. Doom Dejire also had a knack for sending me to alternate worlds like this as well.</p>
<p>Anyway, the woman who spoke to me was a tall, blonde woman who appeared to be a formidable warrior. However, I quickly recognized her as Yeon-Hee. She motioned for me to be silent by placing her index finger on her lips, then guided me to one side.</p>
<p>There were only a few onlookers in our vicinity as most were either drunk or scattered throughout the campsite, reveling in their own festivities. I also held a bottle of alcohol in my hand, with wrinkles and scars serving as a testament to the numerous times I had been stabbed. Furthermore, I noticed a knife hanging from my waist.</p>
<p>“Your name is Zico. We both used to be farmers in the Forest of Wailing, but it has been a little over a year since we joined this mercenary army. The mercenary captain is teaching swordsmanship to the three of us, including Onir. We have traveled back around twenty-five years.”</p>
<p>I commented, “This is interesting.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “The stronger they are, the better mental defense system they have. Onir’s is far inferior to Ronsius’s, but it’s better than nothing. These guys are annoying.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee grumbled. Despite her changed appearance, her facial expression and eyes were sufficient enough for me to identify her.</p>
<p>She added, “Mana’s influence is added to their training, so the Old One must be protecting their mentality to a certain extent.”</p>
<p>“So you haven’t taken full control of his mentality?” I asked.</p>
<p>She gestured vaguely. “Well, half and half.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>She simply said, “Focus. You will feel something naturally.”</p>
<p>I could activate my Sixth Sense here, as well as skills such as Night Eye that enhanced my visibility in darkness, and all the stats that enabled me to ascend to the Ender section. The distinction between reality and the illusion of power was evident, but whatever was feasible on the outside was also possible in this mental realm.</p>
<p>“What if we get killed here?” I asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “There is no chance of that in the realm he is aware of.”</p>
<p>“What if it happens?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee explained, “We will be bounced off from this world, and that’s it. We didn’t come in separately with a separate mental system, so there will be no impact on us.”</p>
<p>“Mental system?”</p>
<p>She clarified, “It can be explained in a concept of soul or spirit.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Ah, I see what you are talking about. I have cut open something like that before. Then, what happens if I break through the gate to Elsland?”</p>
<p>This was the safe way to reach the Queen of Elsland.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee pointed out, “If he was in a position to go to Elsland, then he wouldn’t have been robbing like this, right?”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>She sighed slightly. “We can’t go somewhere that he doesn’t remember. If you need to because of the command you got, then we need to go into the mind of someone who has close contact with the queen.”</p>
<p>“What if we do that now?”</p>
<p>“The void will unfold, and the defense system of this world will notice us. But that’s what we are going to do now. Try to break through the gate to Elsland. Let’s do that first before anything troublesome happens.”</p>
<p>Yeon-hee smiled mischievously.</p>
<p>“Okay, Seon-Hu? No, my brother, Zico.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><strong>[Power 76 / 380]</strong></p>
<p>As I opened the gate, the location that materialized was identical to the dark zone where the System had forcefully grouped together three individuals and informed us that only one could exit alive in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said as if I didn’t need to intervene, “Do you want to watch or join us?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Neither. You watch.”</p>
<p>The ‘Defense System’ entity entered through the gate, sporting a cold expression.</p>
<p>He said, “Things that were not supposed to enter, have entered.”</p>
<p>He was one of the mercenaries who had been drinking. Although he was speaking in their native tongue, I was able to comprehend him. Right then, I understood why Yeon-Hee had mentioned that this would be a great opportunity to learn their language.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee replied as if she was scolding me., “Their defense system sucks as much as the way they don’t grasp the situation. I can’t believe such a weak guy is acting up. Close the gate, Seon-Hu. He is nothing.”</p>
<p>Although she had no intention of killing him, she sounded like she was suggesting that I could satisfy my curiosity by toying with him as much as I desired.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee stepped away to grant me the freedom to attack him as I pleased.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the entity with the exterior of a mercenary charged toward me. Notably, the technique it used to create the trajectory was the same as before, but the speed at which the body was hurled was faster than what I had witnessed during Onir’s fight with Seong-Il. He appeared to have the intention of piercing my throat with the Aurora Blade[1] that he had launched from a sluggish speed.</p>
<p>As I looked at it hurtling towards me, I telepathically connected with Yeon-Hee, transmitting at an extremely high frequency, faster than if I had spoken aloud.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: He must be at a higher level than Onir. Probably around Level 510?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: The defense system here is not precise. Ronsius’s was far superior to his ability. It must be due to the difference between a warrior and a wizard.</p>
<p>The moment when the Aurora Blade split into two was captured in slow motion, with the trajectory aimed at my neck transforming into a vertical line that was now aimed at my groin. He was attempting to slice me into four separate pieces.</p>
<p>The weapon in Seong-Il’s left hand had been smashed by this exact same attack.</p>
<p>I leapt towards Onir and delivered a swift kick with the sole of my foot, sending him hurtling towards the path of his still-active blade. In a panic, he raised his protective shield just in time to narrowly escape with his life.</p>
<p>Despite his shield absorbing most of the impact, the force of the collision managed to chip away at a layer of the barrier, causing him to rebound toward me uncontrollably.</p>
<p>It was unnecessary for me to use my skills on him. As I had just done, I pushed him back into his trajectory when the mercenary threw the blade at me again. After a few more times of repeating the same procedure, this stupid idiot’s shield was completely worn off.</p>
<p>With his neck now firmly within my grasp, he writhed in agony and attempted to kick weakly at my body, though it was clear that he lacked the strength to deliver any meaningful blows. His kicks were not intended as attacks, but rather a feeble attempt to break free from me.</p>
<p>He was dying like a real human. When he began to make noise as he strangled with a ghastly pale face, I added more strength to my grip. My thumb and index finger pierced through his skin, and they made contact inside his flesh.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee walked out while looking at the corpse.</p>
<p>“Nothing should bother us for now. I have full control of his mentality.”</p>
<p>Based on her words, she appeared to be familiar with guys like him.</p>
<p>I said, “Yeon-Hee…”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“How long were you in Ronsius’s mental world?” I finally asked.</p>
<p>She said she had been there for more than one year. At one point, she served as an apprentice to Ronsius. On the second time, she was a member of King Onyx and the Holy Knight's expeditionary team at a different time, and in the third, she also experienced living as Ronsius.</p>
<p>Moreover, she mentioned that she made sure to come out to reality occasionally and apply the techniques she had learned during that time, while also ensuring that she didn’t get lost in fantasy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, compared to Yeon-Hee’s exceptional ability, these procedures were quite basic. She could even read a person’s life story just by looking into their eyes.</p>
<p>Upon questioning, she provided me with a similar response. According to her, the strength of the Old One's will was directly linked to the amount of mana possessed by the target. As such, it exerted corresponding limitations. She suggested that the only way to truly understand a particular time period was to travel back in time and experience it firsthand. Additionally, she emphasized the need to invest significant effort into brainwashing strong individuals.</p>
<p>This explained how Yeon-Hee was able to become Ronsius during her last visit to his mental world. She had manipulated memories to make the real Ronsius believe that he was her disciple, allowing her to take on his persona.</p>
<p>She smacked her lips in regret. “Well… But he realized who he was and eventually killed himself.”</p>
<p>She also mentioned that things would have been different if everything had happened on our mainland as Mana’s influence was cut off there.</p>
<p>“So what is our plan from now on?” I asked.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “There is nothing to wait for since we have taken the initiative. We will move right away. Also, don’t laugh when you see this, okay?”</p>
<p>“See what?”</p>
<p>Similar to Joshua’s transformation back to his old face, Yeon-Hee’s face began to contort and change. Once the transformation was complete, I realized why she had warned me not to laugh. She looked and sounded like Seong-Il now.</p>
<p>“You heard him too. I want to do him a favor.”</p>
<p><em>Swoosh-!</em></p>
<p>The background disappeared with the sound.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, blinking, Yeon-Hee, who was disguised as Seong-Il, was kicking a guy straight in the face. The face that was crushed and turned toward me was the face of Onir in his youth. He was looking up at me with a look of appeal for help.</p>
<p>“Zico… Stop your brother…”</p>
<p>However, he soon grabbed Yeon-Hee’s foot and begged for mercy.</p>
<p>“I… I am so sorry… Hyung[2]. Please…”</p>
<p>It was because Yeon-Hee looked like Seong-Il. Her eyes were filled with rage that was similar to the ones she had during the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Yeon-hee remained silent. All she did was grab a fistful of young Onir’s hair and pull him up to stand while staring at him intently. Despite his inability to resist, Onir trembled with fear under her gaze, reminding me of a goldfish that had escaped from its tank.</p>
<p>She snarled, “Don’t act like a friend just because we have the same master. If you treat me like that again… I will kill you.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>“I will kill you even if you tell Master… I’m going to slit your throat and throw your head to the herd of wild dogs.”</p>
<p>He begged piteously, “I… I would say that I was beaten up at a gambling house. I deserve all the criticism.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee actually took out a dagger and put it in front of his eyes. The tip of the knife was reflected in his pupils.</p>
<p>“I will bring the Master,” Yeon-Hee said.</p>
<p>She spoke to me while winking and gesturing with her knife over Onir’s shoulder. Seeing Seong-Il’s face wink like that made me speechless for a moment.</p>
<p>Time slowly passed after Yeon-Hee left the room. During that time, Onir shivered and even avoided my gaze. This was definitely the appearance of a person who had been exposed to violence for a long time.</p>
<p>Soon, Yeon-Hee returned with a bulky guy. He was the captain of the mercenaries and the master who had been training us in swordsmanship.</p>
<p>“Where did you get beaten that much?” he asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee, who was crossing her arms behind the mercenary captain, made a brief gesture at Onir with her chin.</p>
<p>Onir replied, “I got into a quarrel at the gambling house. Since I’m like this, they are… They probably need to lie down in bed for a few days. You don’t need to worry about it.”</p>
<p>Blood kept leaking out of his mouth every time he moved his lips because he hadn’t spat out all the blood yet.</p>
<p>“Is it something that I should be concerned about?” the captain asked.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, they were nothing. Just parasites at the gambling house.”</p>
<p>“If you get involved in an affair with aristocrats…” Master gnawed his teeth.</p>
<p>“I am not that crazy and tactless. Isn’t that right, Zico?”</p>
<p>As he glanced at Yeon-Hee’s face, he sent me a signal to help him out. I briefly nodded to the mercenary.</p>
<p>“Zico was there too. I swear they were not like nobles.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then. Follow me, all of you. I will open the door for you to become Sword Users. You know what you should give me in return, right?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee answered, “Loyalty. I can even give you my life. I swear under the name of the Lord Lacryma.”</p>
<p>“Don’t even think about that fucking god!” the captain snapped.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I will give you the luck that you will never find elsewhere. Make sure to master everything before you enter the next battle on the frontline. The next battle is different from what you have been through so far because you are getting into the battlefield against the Holy Knights. Okay?”</p>
<p>“H…Holy Knight! Y… Yes, sir!” Onir cried out with a mixture of worry and excitement.</p>
<p>Then, I heard Yeon-Hee contacting me telepathically.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: The introduction course won’t take long.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: I hope it works for us.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Yeah. We will be moving to the place where he got Saint Cassian’s records. The place that got him to his current position.</p>
<p>Two weeks had passed since the captain of the mercenary declared the end of the introductory course. Unlike our concerns, in the beginning, we were able to deal with Mana.</p>
<p>1. A rare and powerful sword that appears in video games and is often characterized by its unique design, high damage output, and special abilities. ☜</p>
<p>2. How Korean males call their older brothers or friends older than them. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 374</p>
<p>The behavior of Mana could be compared to the effect produced by dropping oil paint into a container of water and placing paper on the surface. This was a technique I had experimented with in my art class back when I went to school. The outcome of the process was always unique, as the shapes and patterns produced by the spreading of the paint were determined by chance.</p>
<p>If I looked closely at the paper, some resembled butterflies while others reminded me of snakes. Some people might recall heavy rain pouring down from the paper.</p>
<p>That was why traditional swordsmanship in this world was named after some natural phenomenon, animals, or objects. Identifying the flow of Mana was their priority, so swinging the weapon was a natural step following that.</p>
<p>Traditional swordsmanship didn’t deviate from that. This was similar to the magic principles that Yeon-Hee explained, and conversely, we could anticipate the trajectory of the opponent’s attack in advance by understanding the flow of their movements.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We came back to reality. Yeon-Hee’s real face was finally waiting for me. I had been tired of looking at Seong-Il’s face. Nothing had changed since we had entered Onir’s mental world.</p>
<p>Seong-Il was lying on the ground after having his pain soothed by Mary’s Touch. Meanwhile, Yeon-Hee was taking her hand off Onir's eyes, which she had previously forced open. She nodded with a not-so-contented look on her face. I wasn’t too happy either.</p>
<p>During our two-week-long foray into the introductory course in the mental world, we discovered that the method of Mana usage employed by the warriors in this realm was not suitable for us Awakened. This was due to the fact that they could replenish their depleted Mana from Mother Nature, whereas for us, it could potentially be harmful, akin to poison.</p>
<p>We returned to reality as soon as we finished the introductory course to test it. Yeon-Hee already knew the result as she had gone through the magic apprenticeship process. She had told me a story about it the other day.</p>
<p>Upon returning to reality, I became acutely aware of the mana that permeated this world, having absorbed it into my body through breathing. As the Mana made its way down my respiratory tract and into my lungs, I experienced a sharp and discomforting sensation.</p>
<p>I took more deep breaths out of spite. The unpleasant sensation had become a pain that ticked the tip of my neck. By the time I felt a tingling sensation in my lungs, I tasted blood in my mouth.</p>
<p>Ptooey!</p>
<p>As Yeon-Hee said, the Old One only allowed this world’s species to have his power. If we accepted Mana by force, we would only get injuries. It was impossible for us to absorb more Mana.</p>
<p>It was unfortunate but not a big deal because our purpose from the very beginning was to properly use the source of the superpower we had.</p>
<p>In that sense, Mana could be classified into two categories. One was Mana flowing throughout this world, and it was under the control of the Old One. The other was Mana that had been embedded in the bodies of our world’s Awakened. It was a part of the power that the Old One had handed over to us, which had remained entirely in our possession as the Old One had given us up.</p>
<p>Then, what set apart the techniques employed by the warriors and wizards in this realm, compared to our own, when it came to channeling their powers? The warriors and wizards needed time to recover after depleting their Mana while we had to wait for our cooldown times to pass.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked at the blood-mixed saliva I spat out and asked, “What do you think about Mana inside? All I feel is something like an egg inside me. Yours is so huge that I can’t detect it, and Seong-Il’s is a small one.”</p>
<p>Just as warriors with the same swordsmanship showed the same kinds of movements, so did we. The power was the only difference. On a large scale, about two hundred thousand Awakened would have the same composition of Mana on the surface level.</p>
<p>Whatever Yeon-Hee felt inside her was nothing more than a hollow shell. She couldn’t see through the areas that existed in various sizes and shapes in that eggshell.</p>
<p>I gave her a sign to wait, then moved on to the next experiment.</p>
<p>[You have transformed Devi’s Sword into Kali’s Sword.]</p>
<p>I focused my Sense on the flow of the moving Mana. Unlike my previous state when I couldn’t feel Mana, my Sense was very helpful when it became possible.</p>
<p>Therefore, I could clearly feel the change that took place at that moment as if inward eyes were looking inside me. Within the oval-shaped interior, which Yeon-Hee had likened to an egg, there were a total of seventeen distinct shapes, each varying in size.</p>
<p>Additionally, there were three shapeless regions that occupied space without any movement, bringing the total count to twenty. These areas presumably governed different skills and traits.</p>
<p>Notably, one of the regions had undergone a transformation when Devi’s Sword was converted into Kali’s sword, ranking second-largest in size among the twenty regions. Kali’s Sword was drawing a rough, oval shape trajectory and rotated continuously.</p>
<p>I turned that into the form of Devi’s Sword again.</p>
<p>[You have transformed Kali’s Sword into Devi’s Sword.]</p>
<p>Devi’s Sword was also spinning in a shape like a dagger. Every skill and trait that had cooldown time was rotating like that.</p>
<p>[You have used Devi’s Sword.]</p>
<p>My purpose was to use the skill this time. Devi’s Sword was thrown in a straight line toward the distant sky. The region responsible for Devi’s Sword exhibited a similar rotational movement albeit smaller in size. Over time, it gradually returned to its original size, indicating the cooldown time.</p>
<p>Such a set of compositions was the blueprint that the Old One had created in the Awakened. The source of the natural recharge of Mana, depleted through skill usage, could be attributed to the rotational power within the region. It was a clever yet foolish move by the Old One to implant power plant-like functions within each of us.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Onir hadn't completely lost his mind. He was slowly blinking his swollen eye and shaking his fingertips.</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but click my tongue as his youthful face had aged instantly. He was on the verge of death. Now that I looked back, I remembered that his face was never intact in the mental world as Yeon-Hee using Seong-Il’s face had beaten him up every single day.</p>
<p>“He is still alive. Wow, I’m impressed.” Seong-Il said after recovering from his wounds.</p>
<p>Since then, Onir used his remaining energy to shake his whole body. When Seong-Il put his face close to him, Onir was definitely terrified like a mouse in front of a poisonous snake.</p>
<p>Seong-Il was about to tell us something but stopped as I was pulling out a block of Mana. Gaia’s Will was an A-class skill, but it had become useless after the beginning of the Stage of Advent, so its proficiency level was only four, which was inferior to my other skills.</p>
<p>My Sense stat in the Ender section was amazingly helpful. Mana Blade was the exclusive property of the warriors here, but I had no problem releasing the power without their guidance. The energy of Mana Blade began to form at my fingertips.</p>
<p>Srrrr-</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee knew that she shouldn’t disturb me. She opened her mouth after I pulled back the Mana Blade before it activated.</p>
<p>She asked, “Why?”</p>
<p>I explained, “Gaia’s Will will break if I complete the Mana Blade.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It will break the initial blueprint, and it will be irreparable.”</p>
<p>I explained to Yeon-Hee about what flows existed in the shell that she felt and how the Old One had designed the Awakened.</p>
<p>“I should reach the Ender section in order to feel that much, right?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>It was unfortunate that Yeon-Hee couldn’t do whatever I could.</p>
<p>The term ‘rebuilding’ was referring to the past where we went through the process of removing skills and traits that had become obsolete and replacing them with more useful ones.</p>
<p>However, the definition of the word was different now from what I recalled. It was not just praying for the desired skill to emerge by acquiring the box, but also the process of reassembling it yourself using internal Mana.</p>
<p>The skill Gaia’s Will, which triggered monsters to become aggressive and absorbed their physical and magical damage to a small extent, and the trait Collector, which lowered the probability of item disappearance upon reinforcement failure, were marked for removal. Also, if I combined Seth’s Nail, Road of the King of Hell, and Hera’s Lunacy, and concentrated their power on the most useful Hanuman’s Tail…</p>
<p>I was confident that its power would surpass Odin’s Wrath. No… I believed that it would reach the power of Odin’s Thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Thud. Thud.</p>
<p>My heart raced with the same exhilaration that I had felt during those old days I had spent hitting jackpots with Jonathan, even though I already knew the outcome. I was more excited as I knew the consequences that would happen.</p>
<p>My battle against Dragorin had taught me that when it came to fighting powerful transcendent beings, having a single, strong main skill was far more effective than possessing a multitude of skills. It was for this reason that I sought to transform the concept of Power into tangible, usable strength.</p>
<p>I came to the conclusion to combine all those skills and decided to look for ways to fill the remaining vacancies later on.</p>
<p>I raised a lump of Mana inside me to the point where the first blueprint was destroyed and formed the Mana into a Mana Blade.</p>
<p>[You have removed Gaia’s Will.]</p>
<p>[You have removed Collector.]</p>
<p>More!</p>
<p>[You have removed Seth’s Nail.]</p>
<p>Mana Blade became thicker and longer. It emitted a dazzling array of colors that illuminated the faces of both Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il as they lifted their heads to gaze upon the blade.</p>
<p>[You have removed Hera’s Lunacy.]</p>
<p>More!</p>
<p>[You have removed the Road of the King of Hell.]</p>
<p>The Sacred Sword that had emerged from the War of New Devil would have appeared like this. A sword that was so vast that I had to tilt my head to glimpse its tip materialized from my fingertips, expanding in width to the point where Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il were forced to quickly distance themselves.</p>
<p>Onir, who had been terrified of Seong-Il, was entranced by the awe-inspiring spectacle before him. The weapon was so mighty that it could merge multiple potent skills upon collection, and when wielded, could slice through time and space. However, it wasn’t reasonable to use it as a one-time weapon.</p>
<p>I was thankful for this now. If this had been possible during the battle against Doom Dejire, then I would have used only a few skills to their maximum potency as I had no idea how the Life Vessel worked at that time.</p>
<p>Soon, Mana Blade, a clump of Mana that I made by pulling the skills to their limit, began to shrink at the rate at which it grew and expanded. Gritting my teeth, I sensed an explosive surge of power building within me. Several beams of light flashed as I focused on collecting the energy and sending it toward Hanuman’s Tail.</p>
<p>The bewildered faces of Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il flashed by the lightning power multiple times, and their voices were cut off by the sound of thunder.</p>
<p>However, I was still concentrating. It was imperative that I consistently infused Mana into the flow comprising Hanuman’s Tail, while simultaneously refraining from disrupting its shape.</p>
<p>When my focus reached its peak and all my Ender Sense was focused only on the flow of Mana…</p>
<p>Swoosh-</p>
<p>I could no longer see or hear anything. It seemed like I had been transported to a realm of pure Mana, a universe separate from reality. It appeared as though I could truly lay hold of the entities present in that space.</p>
<p>Among the entities present were the indomitable Man Who Overcomes Adversity, Devi's Sword constantly evolving despite being in cooldown, the Passion that eagerly awaited the climax, Odin's Wrath capable of tearing everything apart, the Moong Water God's Punishment imbued with healing energy within its swirling waters, the Forerunner exhibiting rapid pendulum-like movements, and the Sensitive with the vertices of its hexagonal star pulsating in and out.</p>
<p>At last, Hanuman’s Tail reached its full size and emanated an unmistakable aura. Its formation was now complete and it appeared to shoot out from the world of concentrated Mana as if it were being propelled back into reality.</p>
<p>Swoosh-!</p>
<p>Messages popped up.</p>
<p>[The skill, Hanuman’s Tail, has been reinforced for an unknown reason.]</p>
<p>[ * It is not a skill that existed in the system under the Old One.]</p>
<p>Then, the next messages appeared.</p>
<p>[Effect: It forms the Wing of Gehenna Flame and three tails.]</p>
<p>[Please name the new skill.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 375</p>
<p>[You have used (No Name).]</p>
<p>It was indeed a skill that was created by reinforcing Hanuman’s Tail, and I named the three tails Alpha, Beta, and Gamma starting from the left. Their destructive power was the same, but their combined strength far surpassed the original skill, which only had one tail.</p>
<p>I wrapped Alpha around my waist, bent Beta over my head, and positioned Gamma on my right side. Excitement coursed through me as I witnessed the three red flashes pulsating ahead, each exuding a distinct energy. Hanuman’s Tail had also had this, but the difference between one tail and three wasn’t just like a three-minus-one job.</p>
<p>A set of wings had also appeared. This time I focused on the wings while operating my three tails. The wings lacked a complicated structure, so they didn’t have any joints connecting to my body. In addition, they also didn’t have any feathers, making it harder to steer and stop. Basically, the wings themselves were superheated flames just like the tail!</p>
<p>I covered my front with these fiery wings.</p>
<p>Swoosh-</p>
<p>With the front parts of the wings overlapping, it appeared as if a massive wall of flames was before me. It was superior to Ra’s Sun Cape and felt as though an incarnation was safeguarding me.</p>
<p>When I spread my wings again, embers scattered in all directions. There were so many that it reminded me of the falling flowers of cherry blossoms when a gust of wind blew by. On first impression, the scene was beautiful. However, each ember had a destructive power, like fragments of lightning derived from the bolt of lightning.</p>
<p>That was why Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il hurriedly stepped back again after they first tried to approach me.</p>
<p>Only Onir’s scream filled the air. He had been abandoned near me earlier, and the embers that had fallen on the ground were gnawing at his body. The embers had pierced holes in his body, resembling multiple bullet wounds.</p>
<p>He was able to survive only because he was a Sword Master. If he had been a civilian, then he would have been engulfed in flames and turned into ashes.</p>
<p>Seong-Il hastily pulled him out.</p>
<p>I flapped my wings several times, and flames blazed everywhere. On one occasion, as I extended my wings with greater force, the resulting gust of wind that occurred acted as if it was adding fuel to a blazing fire.</p>
<p>The area around me resembled Dragorin Red’s fiery battleground. Although I was standing amidst flames, the only impact I felt was the disorienting effect of the intense heat waves. I didn’t feel any pain, and my clothes remained unscathed as I was the one who had formed the flames.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: The fire keeps spreading. You know our occupied territory is close to here, right?</p>
<p>I had reached the point where I had roughly acquired a sense of controlling wings. Therefore, even if I struck down with the wings, the wind of fire and heat didn’t burst out again. The village, which had already been ravaged by the fight between Seong-Il and Onir, was now engulfed by flames. In the distance, I could see fortunate soldiers escaping. Seong-Il, carrying Onir on his shoulder, was also fleeing the inferno, not far from me.</p>
<p>Tilting my wings as far back as possible, I swooped down toward the ground. A gust of wind, stronger than a storm but without any heat, blew past. The flames dissipated. Down below, the landscape resembled the aftermath of Odin’s Thunderstorm that had swept across the earth. The wind had blown away the ashes, revealing the charred ground, while on the other side of the wind direction, an entire hill was covered in ashes.</p>
<p>[Please name the new skill.]</p>
<p>Hmm… What should I call this now? Phoenix because there are three tails and one pair of wings? The Incarnation’s Wrath since it’s similar to Odin’s Wrath? No, I’m Odin.</p>
<p>According to Norse Mythology, Odin always had ethereal animals around him like crows and wolves. It was perfect to call it like that.</p>
<p>[You have named it ‘Odin’s Ethereal Animal.’]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Ethereal Animal (Skill)</p>
<p>Skill Class: S</p>
<p>Effect: Creates superheated flame wings and three tails.</p>
<p>Proficiency: LV.8 - MAX</p>
<p>Duration: 6 hours</p>
<p>Cooldown time: 12 hours (Remaining time: 11 hours 57 minutes)]</p>
<p>Right then, Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il approached me with dreamy eyes, but I didn’t have time to explain to them what I felt at that moment. I opened the gate in front of them and shouted, “Go!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Red-Faced Orc Clan Territory.</p>
<p>Samanos, the sorcerer, received an order from the chief. He instructed him to determine whether the huge flow of mana that suddenly appeared and vanished was beneficial or harmful to the clan.</p>
<p>Samanos considered bringing in a wizard with strong mental abilities, but ultimately decided against it after recalling that a wizard with similar abilities, sent by the prophet of Elsland, had recently been badly hurt in a nearby area.</p>
<p>Samanos turned away. He had opened up a small door that led to the spirit world by piling up soil. A few seconds later, one of the curious low-class spirits popped up in his head. He was Noum.</p>
<p>Noum appeared with a frown as the Declans’ rotten stench filled the air. Then, a voice containing sacred power was heard from the sky, “You will die on the spot if you try to run away.”</p>
<p>When Noum raised his head, sharp molars came into his view first, then he saw the two eyes of an orc that contained red energy.</p>
<p>Samanos continued, “There was a movement of Grand Mana in the Franklin Duchy. I waited for you to ask about this. You would know best that lies won’t work for me. Just answer the question and go back.”</p>
<p>There were other orcs around, but Samanos was the only one who could hear the spirit’s voice. Noum was frightened and spent a long time telling him everything he knew. The story was something that Samanos wanted to hear but wasn’t at the same time. Basically, Noum kept emphasizing that Samanos would be able to meet someone else who could answer him.</p>
<p>Samanos released the spirit and waited for the visitor. The visitor appeared to be an ordinary native of Greenwood Continent, but Samanos could feel a great entity inside it.</p>
<p>The Flame King of Spirit. The Great Emperor of Flames, Celeon!</p>
<p>Samanos rebuked the orcs who had threatened the visitors, then guided them directly to the chief.</p>
<p>“One of the Spirit Kings has come,” Samanos said.</p>
<p>“Hello, Chief. It’s our first time meeting, right?”</p>
<p>The visitor looked like a bubbly boy, but there was stained and hardened blood on his coat and face. Looking at the face alone, this was not much different from the orc clan that put the blood of Declans on their faces on purpose.</p>
<p>The chief growled with fierce eyes, “Boy. Only your owner of the body, Celeon, can talk to me.”</p>
<p>The boy smirked. “Celeon says you’d better treat me the same way.”</p>
<p>Samanos shook his head at Chief Bomos. Then, he intervened by serving the boy who arrived from the battlefield a cup of water, cutting through the tension. Since it was a large glass used by orcs, the boy was holding it with both hands tightly around it.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Bomos was displeased by the boy’s lack of fear despite being in the midst of the clan. The chief was honest with his feelings, so he didn’t try to hide his true emotions and made it clear that he didn’t approve of the boy’s presence by jutting out his chin and baring his teeth in a menacing manner.</p>
<p>However, the boy wasn’t at all intimidated by Bomos. Rather, he stared at Bomos’s face as if he had little experience of seeing orcs this close.</p>
<p>The boy said, “I was at the duchy right below here.”</p>
<p>Then, Bomos realized where the blood on the boy came from. He had fought against the Demon Corps alone.</p>
<p>The boy continued cheekily, “You are wondering what I’m talking about, right? It means that I did what you should have done. In other words, you owe me.”</p>
<p>“Are you the son of the duke, boy?” the chief asked.</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Are you the Duchy’s people?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then, nothing matters.”</p>
<p>The boy shrugged. “Ah, you are still being pigheaded. This is not something you should say, considering you share a border with the Demon Corps.”</p>
<p>At that time, the movements outside the barracks were unusual because the warriors who had tried peeking in let everyone know how arrogant the boy was. Large shadows wielding clubs and axes were gathering around the barrack.</p>
<p>The boy laughed as he saw the shadows, which even made Samanos have difficulty suppressing his anger. His eyes became cold. Although the boy had the Spirit King inside him, he was in front of the chief of the clan.</p>
<p>Bomos was looking down at the little boy after standing up from his seat. The boy stopped laughing, but he still said in a mischievous tone, “Let’s not fight between us.”</p>
<p>Then, he gestured to the area behind his shoulder using the tip of his thumb. He wasn’t referring to the orc warriors. Instead, he was alluding to something beyond that, in the direction where a substantial shift of Mana was occurring.</p>
<p>“The Demon King is getting stronger. Celeon says you have to remove the root before it gets any stronger,” the boy continued.</p>
<p>The chief mused, “So, it was…the Demon King.”</p>
<p>“Then, what else could it have been?” asked the boy somewhat sarcastically.</p>
<p>“Caldoran, King Onyx, and Ronsius. Do you know that these three strong Holy Knights were exterminated?” the chief asked.</p>
<p>The boy shook his head. “Celeon says not to compare this with those guys.”</p>
<p>“Then, why are you asking me for help?”</p>
<p>The boy pointed out, “We are not asking you to be Saint Jayden. That’s up to us with Sylphid, Elyme and Noas.”</p>
<p>When the boy mentioned all the names of the Spirit Kings, Bomos and Samanos quickly exchanged glances. Hot breath began to come out of Bomos’s mouth and nostrils, the boy nodded and said as if he was being generous, “Celeon says that the Greenwood tribes do not deserve the land, so the great warriors of Lord Lacryma should take control.”</p>
<p>The chief grumbled, “I trust the owner of your body, but I can’t trust you. Tell Celeon to come forward and talk to me in person. Then, I will keep the pledge in the honor of the warrior.”</p>
<p>“Why would we all be here if I was wrong?”</p>
<p>The boy turned toward the entrance of the barracks and waved his arms. There was a little disturbance in that direction.</p>
<p>The orcs opened the way under the direction of the sorcerer Samanos. Then, three men and women, who were hidden by the orcs, walked out through the road. The tall young man simply looked forward with an emotionless face, the fat old man was smiling, and the silver-haired beauty glared spitefully at the orcs.</p>
<p>Then, the boy grinned at Bomos.</p>
<p>“We will seal the demon. Then, the chief and our warriors of the Lord Lacyrma should wipe out the rest of the Demon Corps, and …”</p>
<p>However, the boy was unable to complete his sentence and could only emit a scream.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>The three, who served Spirit King as the owners of their bodies, flinched. Bomos and Samanos widened their eyes.</p>
<p>A vertical tear appeared in the space behind the boy, expanding as he looked on. Despite the fiery figure emerging from the gap, it was evident that this couldn’t be Celeon, the Flame King of Spirit.</p>
<p>The speed at which the space was torn was unbelievable, and entities invaded from the gap in a blink of an eye. The lightning bolts that were accompanying the guy penetrated the boy’s body, and the scene turned into chaos.</p>
<p>Debris was strewn about as flames of unknown origin shot up, and the storms raged on with unyielding heat. Three crimson flashes darted toward those whose bodies were possessed by the Spirit Kings.</p>
<p>Bomos’s face was impaled by a spear, its tip crackling with a lightning energy that incinerated Samanos in a mere second. All of this occurred in quick succession, immediately following the boy’s brief scream, causing the entire earth to shake and flip over. It wasn’t until the red afterglow had descended to the ground and dust had been kicked up in all directions that he became visible once again.</p>
<p>He was in the air. With blazing wings, three red flashes, a fluttering cape, a golden chest plate, and a thunderbolt-laden spear in his right hand, his lightning-streaked appearance left no doubt in the minds of the orcs that he was the Demon who would bring the night, the one known as Doom Man.</p>

<p>Chapter 376</p>
<p>Science Mission Department of NASA.</p>
<p>A yellow dwarf star that was identical to the sun was observed, and there were several planets orbiting it. One of these planets, which was in conflict with the association, had been identified by the association as Dragorin.</p>
<p>One of NASA’s scientific missions had been to find out where Dragorin was located in space. Some inquiring minds needed to discover the unknown. Furthermore, they wanted to find out if the distance between the two planets was close enough such that their attacks could be carried out through other means than the gate.</p>
<p>Their sun was twenty percent brighter and ten percent larger than the earth’s sun. Also, the radius of Star Dragorin, which considered the dwarf star as their mother star, was 1.6 times bigger than that of the Earth. Looking at these two alone, the most likely candidate was Cygnus, which was fourteen hundred light-years away from Earth.</p>
<p>NASA had already discovered a yellow dwarf star in similar condition and super-Earth in distant space around 2015. They named the dwarf star ‘Kepler-452’ and the super-Earth ‘Kepler-452b.’</p>
<p>Interestingly enough, the planet Dragorin’s mass was greater than Earth’s, yet its gravity was comparable. This necessitated a slight deviation from the established laws of physics to explain its characteristics. In response, Professor Glick from the science mission team was waiting for Star Dragorin’s observation data to come in.</p>
<p>Originally, he was supposed to have received the information around June 2nd, which was a month ago. The investigators who had entered Dragorin as a part of RMC (Rothschild Military Company)’s mercenary team were expected to send the data, but there was a tragedy in which not a single one of them returned. They had all been burnt to death, and there were no corpses to recover. At their funerals, the relics and tears of the widows replaced their bodies.</p>
<p>Glick hesitated as he was about to hold the coffee pot because the black color of the coffee reminded him of the scene of the tragedy. The scene that was captured in the picture was truly disastrous.</p>
<p>What kind of attack would have caused that? Does that happen when the land is directly exposed to the sun?</p>
<p>The melted fortress, which had later hardened and turned into a lump of rock, was all black just like this coffee. When the mission assistant station gave him a telephone call, the coffee had already cooled down.</p>
<p>“Everyone, come here. It is here.”</p>
<p>Glick called in his team members. As he pressed the enter key, a stream of observational data that had been obtained at a great cost flooded the monitor. It was a five-day observation report of Franklin Dukedom, where a small civilization was located in Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>The fact that Glick received such a summary meant the second group of investigators had returned safely without going through the tragedy that the first group experienced. Glick and his team members were relieved.</p>
<p>Soon, countless data-generated stars popped up on the monitor. Observation clips were played on the other monitor, and they showed a beautiful night sky that couldn’t be imagined in the land of chaos.</p>
<p>They could see the moon and a blue planet quite adjacent to Dragorin. Despite the fact that Dragorin and the blue planet were in close proximity and their gravitational fields were interacting, no observable natural phenomena that were influenced by the gravitational pull had been identified yet.</p>
<p>As Glick and his team stared at the monitor in silence, they started frowning at one point and exchanging glances in excitement and bewilderment. It was because there was no single corner that matched the Earth data that had been organized as a control group and the observation data from the video.</p>
<p>None of the constellations that mankind had given all kinds of names existed in the night sky of Dragorin.</p>
<p>Our technology is not complete. But this is…</p>
<p>Glick had to ponder before coming to a conclusion. He was one of the few astronomers who treated multiple cosmologies critically, but the fact was that new stars existed in different locations. This data proved the multiverse theory. The outcomes matched those of the initial team of researchers who had identified them through visual observation.</p>
<p>Glick pointed at the monitor and said, “At this point…isn’t it clear that they are in a different universe from ours?”</p>

<p>Safety Department Official Only Zone in the World Awakened Association Headquarters.</p>
<p>Around seventy days ago, on the last Sunday of April, a team consisting of the linguist Ling Wei and artificial neural network programmers was led into the headquarters of the association. There was also an Awakened who had the mental skills.</p>
<p>Their duty in the prohibited zone was to decipher not only the guts of the Dragorin language, but also everything about it. The alien language exhibited characteristics typical of the traditional Germanic language, such as employing a dental consonant for the past tense instead of apophony, dividing verbs into weak and strong conjugations, and placing emphasis on the root of the word.</p>
<p>There was no difficulty like in the movie [Contact] as their language wasn’t deviated from Verner’s law[1]. The fictional aliens dealt within the film were a completely different being beyond time and space and possessed a completely different concept of language from mankind.</p>
<p>However, the real aliens in the Star Dragorin weren’t like that as they looked similar and also used a language style as humans. Therefore, Ling Wei first listed the basic noun vocabularies that were bound to exist in Dragorin’s civilization - for instance, me, mom, dad, food, and water.</p>
<p>The first day of the work proceeded in a strict environment as if Ling Wei was interrogating heinous death-row convicts. The two Dragorin inmates were confined and were present at the scene. There were also Awakened with automatic rifles.</p>
<p>However, Ling Wei had been trying to change the environment because she believed she needed voluntary cooperation from the two Dragorins. She expanded the prison space, and provided beds and a nutritious diet. Also, she gradually lowered their restraint levels depending on the degree of their cooperation.</p>
<p>Therefore, unlike how their entire limbs had been bound in the beginning, only microchips were now embedded in their body, as freedom was guaranteed in the space beyond the reinforced glass wall.</p>
<p>Ling Wei first obtained fundamental noun vocabularies followed by verbs and then constructed simple sentences with the intention of learning the Dragorin language rather than teaching them Earth’s language. Therefore, it was a one-sided interaction. Typically, she relied on language learning videos or flashcards designed for children, demonstrating specific actions for which they would then respond to with sentences.</p>
<p>The two Dragorin inmates, Elland and Malus, were brilliant aliens, and the study was successful. They went through complex sentences after the basic ones.</p>
<p>And now, it was July 3rd. Ling Wei faced the two inmates with a reinforced glass wall in between them.</p>
<p>“There is a high chance that you guys will be transferred to another place tomorrow. Just wanted to let you know.”</p>
<p>Elland replied in Dragorin's language on the microphone, “I doubt we’re going back home. Don’t you think so, Ling Wei?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by transferring us? Did you even deliver our message? We told you that we will cooperate with you guys if you let us go! Please!” Malus shouted.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that Ling Wei never sympathized with the two of them, but the Awakened with the mental attribute who ordered her to carry out the research was appallingly strict. In fact, there was a period of time during which she had been reprimanded for becoming emotionally attached to the two, which nearly led to her expulsion from the study.</p>
<p>Of course, she had better control of her emotions now. Around June 2nd, she became aware that the two captives were adversaries of humanity after hearing about the human defeat in a battle. It was a tragedy where so many were burned to death at the Franklin Dukedom. Since then, it hadn't been too difficult for her to regard the two as mere research subjects.</p>
<p>This is wartime, and they are captives.</p>
<p>Ling Wei cut off the sound from the two and turned her back toward the Awakened with a mental attribute who had given her to order.</p>
<p>“Do you think they are honest?”</p>
<p>She responded promptly, “That one is, but the other one is not.”</p>
<p>“Please report that to the higher-ups… Thank you for everything you have done so far.”</p>
<p>Ling Wei didn’t know what decision the superiors would make, but it was out of her control. There would be no more interaction with the two inmates.</p>
<p>When she got up, a screen blocking the view of the glass wall came down with a motor sound. There were artificial neural network programmers in the space right next to it. They joined the association by signing a secret contract from Googol and were skilled in translation technology.</p>
<p>“Today is the last day.”</p>
<p>Ling Wei joined them. Although the translation program was at its beginning level, it was almost completed. While upgrading the unnamed application, recollections of sleepless nights and days flooded her mind. She had provided three million sentences to the programmers. In a short period of time, she was able to secure that much with just over twenty linguistics.</p>
<p>After testing the application, Ling Wei confirmed the completion of the application, then she returned to her team.</p>
<p>Perhaps because the association was notified of the completion of the project, people were applauding them. Some linguists seemed to have been relaxed as they decided to stay in the association while others were debating over whether to return to the university research institute or not.</p>
<p>They were scholars who could use the extraterrestrial language without using the translation program. Ling Wei herself had decided to remain in the association as the representative who would oversee them.</p>
<p>The fact that she had to implant a microchip in her body to become a member of the association bothered her, but she understood why it was necessary. She concurred that it was imperative to exercise inevitable control, given that the matters the association dealt with were intimately linked to the destiny of humanity.</p>
<p>After she signed the contract, she headed over to get the chip implanted. Then, she realized that the atmosphere of the association was different from usual.</p>
<p>“It seems that a lot of outsiders have been introduced. Is something going on today?” she asked.</p>
<p>The Dragorin translation project was being carried out in private, so it was not related to her work. The high-ranking official of the association replied as if it was nothing to hide, “It’s because of the trading system. If you are not too tired, why don’t you introduce the translation program together this time?”</p>
<p>“Ah…the trading system is opening up, right? It must be good news for the Awakened.”</p>
<p>The official nodded. “Yes. We are thinking of preparing a conference for your program after this.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m ok with that.”</p>
<p>There was no reason to refuse because it would be the first stage where she would put her name on the history.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What happened that day was enough to alert the Awakened and capitalists who were on a roll in the small places such as the Franklin Duchy and Xyliver Kingdom. I had removed all four hosts of the Spirit Kings, but one of them had attacked the Franklin Dukedom before that.</p>
<p>It was disastrous. Many of the RMC group’s attack squads were sacrificed. A number of mercenaries died, so the Rothschild family was suffering from compensating the bereaved alone.</p>
<p>In fact, the Spirit King had melted the star itself and created the biggest flame I had ever seen. The route they traveled reminded them of the last day of Pompeii. What if all the four Spirit Kings attacked me with all their might? What if I gave them time to prepare? The tragedy that struck the Franklin Dukedom would have destroyed all the Awakened who had entered the continent.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Spirit Kings had been kicked out from their hosts by me, but they were indeed entities that would cause disasters.</p>
<p>That was why I had remained in the Franklin Duchy until now. Our next course of action would be determined after seeing the Awakened occupying the five hundred thousand square kilometers of the area that included the Franklin Dukedom and the Xyliver Kingdom. I also planned to wait until the system would take place so that my territory wouldn’t be recklessly beaten even if the Spirit Kings came while I was gone.</p>
<p>Starting tomorrow, products bearing the name of our deity and distinguished by A and higher-class insignias would be made available for sale in the market. Awakened would have to lavish their money earned here on equipment, and each squad team would have to prepare joint operations in preparation for a crisis.</p>
<p>In order to do so, the capitalists had to give more money to Awakened by using translation services. It was crucial for humans to expand and establish dominance in various industries by constructing cities and extracting gold from mines, as well as by subjugating the aliens and strengthening their armies. This had to be achieved in the same way that the Barba Crops were divided between the ruling-class reptiles and the subjugated-class rats.</p>
<p>I could guarantee that human capital forces could lead this place much more productively than the aristocrats here. They came in to solely generate revenue, and they were born with that talent. Therefore, they were already proceeding with projects to gain profit even though they couldn’t properly communicate with aliens here.</p>
<p>Thus, the aliens in this realm would come to the realization that being governed by the Demon Corps would be preferable to their previous rulers, as they would at least avoid starving to death under my rule. Also, they would be fascinated by the new culture we had.</p>
<p>This was how individuals were supposed to occupy other territories. Rather than creating dungeons across Dragorin to use the Awakened there, I had to establish a secure zone within the Greenwood Continent and then gradually expand my power, similar to the manner in which an infectious disease grew and spread.</p>
<p>However, that evening Doom Caso, one of the Seven Demon Kings, contacted me by sending a messenger.</p>
<p>1. A historical sound change that explains how certain voiceless fricatives in Proto-Germanic became voiced when they occurred after an unstressed syllable. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 377</p>
<p>I could see the light emanating from the building that was close to my current accommodation. Despite the late hour, the building remained brilliantly illuminated. It had once been a grand mansion that belonged to a prominent aristocrat, but it now served as the inaugural outpost of the Association within the occupied territory.</p>
<p>「Franklin Dukedom</p>
<p>Size: 200,000 square kilometers</p>
<p>Population: 10 million to 11 million」</p>
<p>The investigators had concluded that the reason why the population was so low compared to the size of the land was because only nobles received certain privileges, whereas normal commoners couldn't. Sanitation facilities and medical technology in this world had been developing in a different direction than ours due to their supernatural magic, but these innovations and improvements were only available to the aristocrats.</p>
<p>「Composition of groups in the Franklin Dukedom</p>
<p>* A community with a populace exceeding twenty individuals yet fewer than one thousand is referred to as a small village.</p>
<p>* A community with a populace exceeding one thousand individuals yet fewer than eight thousand is referred to as a village.</p>
<p>* A community with a populace exceeding eight thousand individuals yet fewer than twelve thousand, fortified with a basic defense system such as a fortress, and characterized by vibrant social and economic activities is referred to as a city.</p>
<p>* A community with a populace exceeding twelve thousand individuals yet fewer than one hundred thousand, fortified with an urban system but a center of social and economic activities is referred to as a big city.</p>
<p>* A community fortified with a city or a big city system with a cultural and political center is referred to as the capital city.</p>
<p>Small Villages: Around fifteen thousand</p>
<p>Villages: One hundred twenty-three</p>
<p>Cities: Twenty</p>
<p>Big cities: None</p>
<p>Capital city: One」</p>
<p>I was looking at a laptop that displayed 3D maps of the Franklin Dukedom and Xyliver Kingdom, along with data on the status of occupation for each region. I was deciding where to advance the Awakened next. Then, a meal came in.</p>
<p>“Do you need anything else?”</p>
<p>The Occupation Department of the association had dispatched the woman, who had a prior stint in the U.S. military and had a husband and two daughters living on the mainland. Her motivations for undertaking this mission were unknown to me.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, given her knowledge of the supernatural being that had caused a conflagration on a section of this continent, it was evident that her involvement was not driven solely by curiosity or a thirst for adventure.</p>
<p>She had brought me steamed rice, kimchi, and soybean paste stew. The sizable portion of kimchi on my plate was a testament to the culinary prowess of the cook, and it was apparent that it had been prepared specifically for me.</p>
<p>Although I understood people prioritized the needs of a commander on the battlefield, such as providing water for them to wash their feet over water for soldiers to drink, this was ridiculous. I scolded her on this point and sent her back.</p>
<p>Then, I sensed a spirit, but it wasn’t as threatening as the hosts of the Spirit Kings. It was from the outside of the city walls and had a strong tendency to reveal its existence, especially to me. That was it.</p>
<p>When I focused my Sense in that direction, I heard the Declan’s unique breathing sound through their fangs. Its pounding heart somehow showed its nervousness. It was shaking while purposely letting me know of its existence.</p>
<p>I went outside to check it myself, and it was actually scared. The last time I saw the Declans was during the Final Stage. At that time, they jumped on me, risking their lives, even though they knew they would die. This was a known characteristic of the Declans: a fighting spirit not afraid of death.</p>
<p>However, this guy was on its knees and put its head on the ground. It wasn’t soaked in water, but its ears and mane were drooping. I had never seen a Declan like this.</p>
<p>It must be because it’s in front of a Doom, right?</p>
<p>Upon debating whether to slice his throat or not, I suddenly realized that I became one of the Seven Demon Kings by just thinking about that. Had this had happened before I had become Doom Man, I would have already blown its head away.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was not only unable to convey its anxieties like the Maruka Clan but also didn’t have a translation item that the Barba’s rats possessed. As a result, the only way it could articulate its emotions was through a growl of fear. This was a straightforward expression of emotion, rather than a complex language system. It sounded like it was begging me to spare its life.</p>
<p>At that moment, I discovered the reason why it was able to reach this far through the sensory network of Awakened spread throughout the dukedom. There was a burrow in the ground that the Declans had clearly dug out. The deep passage that was connected to the underground seemed solid without support. I had never seen such a thing from Declan Corps before. Grafs were good at swimming underground, but Declans were dogs with four long legs.</p>
<p>The Declan pointed at the tunnel. It raised itself very carefully, and even though it was bending its waist and neck, it was much taller than me. It refused to make eye contact with me, but I could read the blazing power from his eyes. It couldn’t have been Night Eye.</p>
<p>The scarlet hue in its eyes was distinct. There was also a vertical line of red hair under its eyes in the shape of tears. It was difficult to tell the difference between Declan species, but there were only a few species with red hair.</p>
<p>In the past, red hair was a symbol of fear. They appeared as the boss monster in the B-class dungeon, and even the named Awakened in the past couldn’t deal with them alone. They had eventually been killed by me in the Final Stage. Since it was a species that showed the best double-width ability, the Old One called them ‘Bloody Mane.’</p>
<p>Upon noticing the bone necklace adorning its neck, the creature reacted by recoiling and transitioning to a four-legged gait while remaining aware of my presence. When it paused and hesitated at the tunnel entrance, I inferred that it was signaling for me to follow it.</p>
<p>It’s trying to lead me?!</p>
<p>I was interested. The Man Who Overcomes Adversity had already been recharged. Even if something like Doom Caso was waiting for me, it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Recalling the previous command, I reminded myself that any confrontations between Dooms were only permitted under the authorization of Doom Kaos. However, there existed a concept of a ‘challenge,’ and if Doom Caso had officially issued a challenge to me, then there was no reason for me to avoid it. I had missed the opportunity to teach Doom Caso a lesson in the past, but now was my chance to do so for whatever reason.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The inside of the tunnel was the same as what was identified when I briefly checked from the outside. The entrance was tall enough that I didn’t need to bend my waist. It tilted deep underground, then straightened out.</p>
<p>At that time, the Declan looked back at me miserably. I didn’t want to keep a slow pace behind him throughout this long passage, so it started running as I waved my hand. As a boss of a B-class dungeon, it was capable of maintaining a fast speed for a long time.</p>
<p>Just by looking at the many intersections leading to other passages in the middle, I could tell that the underground passage had definitely been made over the years. I was more certain of this idea when the vast residential areas unfolded in front of me. The Declans seemed to have established their territory from the northern part of the Franklin Duchy, which was right below our occupied regions.</p>
<p>I suddenly snapped, “You’d better fuck off from our areas.”</p>
<p>As the Declan stopped and looked at me submissively, I couldn’t help but wonder if it comprehended my words or if it simply yielded to my intimidating presence. Such was the depth of emotion that even Orca, with all its expressive abilities, couldn’t match the tear-filled glance of the Declan.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We must have passed by the Franklin border a long time ago. We sprinted nonstop and the tunnel led to a spacious area. It was still underground, but it hadn’t been touched by Declans. It was filled with the flow of Mana and maintained a large hole underground.</p>
<p>At that point, I realized why the Declan had brought me here. A section of the wall had been constructed of dirt, and beyond it lay the body of a creature, with only its enormous eyeball protruding through the wall.</p>
<p>How could I ever forget that?!</p>
<p>In the past, the very sight of the eyeball that was responsible for the downfall of mankind filled me with terror. I was certain that I could envision the appearance of Doom Caso even now. Although all that was visible to me at the moment was the protruding eyeball, I knew that there was much more beyond the wall.</p>
<p>Doom Caso was a giant monster, over thirty meters in length. Upon scrutinizing the rough surface of the wall surrounding the bulging eye, I noticed that the various irregularities formed the contours of the creature’s immense face.</p>
<p>Yes, this was the place where Doom Caso, the Demon King who had been sealed by a Holy Knight during the War of New Devil, resided. In the past, it had been kicked out by the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. I heard it had been kicked out by Saint Jaden here.</p>
<p>You were resting here like you were hibernating all those years? Ridiculous.</p>
<p>The absurd eyeball blinked slowly and the pupil moved after me. Fragments began to fall from the wall.</p>
<p>I called with a voice full of hostility, “Doom Caso.”</p>
<p>I clenched my fists to suppress my urge to pull not only that eyeball but also its entire body and split its limbs. However, it wasn’t time to kill it yet as I had to listen to its story. I needed to know why it called me, what it wanted from me, what it could offer me, and how far it knew about the truth of Doom Kaos and this world. I had to use all means to force it to tell me everything.</p>
<p>Srrr-</p>
<p>I could feel Doom Caso sending me messages. Unlike Doom Kaos, which I couldn’t disobey, it belonged to the area where I could block it as much as possible.</p>
<p>Above all, I was annoyed that it had the ability to send me messages without saying anything. It was actually not a special ability as Yeon-Hee could do it. In fact, I already knew that Doom Caso had mental skills from the past.</p>
<p>After confirming that my message was conveyed to it, I said, “I can’t believe that such a low-rank Doom had called me. Your messenger was barehanded, so you’d better prepare something for me.”</p>
<p>The Declan avoided my eye contact and backed away.</p>
<p>“I will hand over the spoils.”</p>
<p>As Doom Caso’s mental message was translated into an audible sound, its voice reverberated heavily, causing the surrounding area to shake and debris to fall from the ceiling of the cave.</p>
<p>“Spoils?” I asked.</p>
<p>“The war has resumed. Doom Kaos must have given you commands as well, so we must cooperate. That’s what he would want, too. All the spoils we get from there will be all yours, Doom Man.”</p>
<p>However, he was on the wrong track as this would only benefit me.</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>We were far away from the Franklin Dukedom, but I hesitated to use an item as I wanted to prevent the devastation of the area where the Awakened would enter.</p>
<p>[*Storage box]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor (God of War) has been removed.]</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Golden Armor.]</p>
<p>“What are you doing?!”</p>
<p>I laughed mirthlessly. “Cooperation? That’s funny. You must obey my orders. Isn’t that how the Demon Corps work? The spoils are of course mine if you work under me. That’s so obvious, you idiot.”</p>
<p>“I am not challenging you, but…”</p>
<p>I had been waiting to meet another Doom anyway, so Doom Caso was always welcome.</p>
<p>“W…wait!”</p>
<p>“I will teach you why I am a higher-ranked monarch than you. Let’s start the conversation again after that.”</p>
<p>[Odin’s Absolute Warzone has been opened.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 378</p>
<p>The lightning bolts that emanated from the tip of the thunderstorm spear were swifter than Doom Caso could react. It belatedly attempted to raise its entire body, which was locked in the wall.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Wrath.]</p>
<p>[Subject: Zeus’s Thunder Spear]</p>
<p>If Doom Caso had been able to move at a comparable pace to my movements with such a huge body, then it would have been ranked in a higher position among Dooms. Simultaneously, the heaps of soil from above crumbled while lightning dispersed in every direction while it squirmed. Since it wasn’t a Graf, I had no intention of digging through the underground soil and fighting with it.</p>
<p>I ascended high up, covering a considerable distance to reach the outside. The smell of damp earth trailed me, and as the clumped soil burst out like a fountain, I merged onto the surface.</p>
<p>Hwak-!</p>
<p>I knew that there would be no residential area here as soon as I stretched out the boundary. I was in a forest under the daylight. The nearby giant trees had been knocked down by the movement that had taken place underground. Therefore, the area above was open and no leaves covered me. However, the sun was hidden by the boundaries of the absolute warzone. Instead, the entire area was engulfed by a white radiance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the spot I broke through to emerge on the surface settled down in silence. Doom Caso appeared to have no desire to engage me in combat, but that was just an illusion. This was a time for discipline, not fighting.</p>
<p>As soon as I wrapped my fingers around the spear, I sent a blow down toward the ground.</p>
<p>Swak-!</p>
<p>Ziiiiing-</p>
<p>It was accompanied by a heavy tremor. The debris scattering on the ground was only a very small part that could be witnessed. A large lightning bolt dug through the ground like a Lightning Dragon, and in fact, it was weaker than the bolts that were reinforced by Odin’s Thunderstorm.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the number of debris that penetrated the outside of the ground increased because the bolts couldn’t control the force. Lightning sprouted everywhere and suddenly acted like flowers in full bloom.</p>
<p>The earth was covered with mini thunderstorms, and they swayed for a long time. As the plants on the ground began to disintegrate into ashes, Doom Caso emerged abruptly, unable to endure the lightning any longer.</p>
<p>One of its hands tore through the ground while the other used the contact surface as support. As the ground crumbled under its weight, a massive crater formed, resembling the size of a meteorite impact.</p>
<p>Then, its head appeared. A copious amount of soil trickled down its facial contours, evoking the image of a mythical creature awakening from the depths of the earth due to my lightning strike.</p>
<p>With the help of lightning, I forcefully made it come out up to its chest level and had to tilt my head back to view its entire countenance. A cascade of soil mixed with fine dust rained down, and its two crimson eyes gazed down at me, displaying its resilience despite being struck by my lightning spear.</p>
<p>Yes, your resilience is unbelievable. That’s why the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues struggled a lot in the past.</p>
<p>“Is it because of what happened on your mainland? That was only because of the command…!”</p>
<p>Doom Caso appeared to have realized that it couldn’t change my mind. It had been avoiding the fight but now stopped trying to dodge me. Then, it swung its fist that was hanging on the ground. Its attack was powerful, but it was so slow that even an Awakened in the diamond section would have been able to avoid it.</p>
<p>However, the wind pressure was difficult to resist, and that was why the named Awakened couldn’t even approach it. The Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues who had reached S-class in the past were the only ones who could confront it.</p>
<p>The pressure exerted by the giant fist gnawed away at my defensive shield and caused my chest and pupils to feel weighed down. As the fist drew closer, the wind pressure intensified twofold. Just as the fist was about to strike me, a vision of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues falling like autumn leaves flashed through my mind.</p>
<p>Not only its fist, but its arm was also huge. Therefore, it felt like a storm surging in the pitch black night. It felt more like that as its fur was dark colored. The black color was especially concentrated on its fist, and I was waiting for it to fill my sight.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>This occurred because I concentrated the lightning energy at the tip of my spear instead of releasing it immediately. As the spearhead was just a single point while the giant fist had a much larger surface area, the outcome of their collision was uncertain and unpredictable.</p>
<p>I just slightly turned the end of the spear at the moment of the collision.</p>
<p>“Gah…”</p>
<p>Its fist had also twisted. The maneuver appeared to warp the black void, which was previously filled with its fists.</p>
<p>Lightning tendrils penetrated through its protective barrier. As they dispersed into multiple streaks and debris, the movement became even more pronounced with blue flashes. Nevertheless, it was apparent that the shield was still working despite the previous attack. If this had been translated into our system, then Doom Caso’s Health would be classified under the Ender category.</p>
<p>At that time, I activated a trait.</p>
<p>[Forerunner has been activated.]</p>
<p>An oval-shaped Mana field appeared, and the gusts within it started to spiral rapidly, coinciding with the pendulum’s swift motion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The speed of Doom Caso colliding with the ground was also slow. While its lower body remained embedded in the ground, only the upper portion toppled over with a resounding crash.</p>
<p>Soil tangled with ash powder was falling down like hail. I wrapped my arms around one of its fingers and lifted it upwards. Its dense hair, tough skin, and sturdy bones were palpable. The noise produced by the forced movement of the joints was deafening. It also sounded like something was breaking loudly.</p>
<p>Just like that, I pulled out its entire body from the ground. As I flung it backward, it collided with the boundary and shook its head before regaining balance. Doom Caso might have perceived me as being upside down since its waist bent, despite standing upright.</p>
<p>“Is it fair now?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Doom Kaos will never tolerate this.”</p>
<p>I pointed behind it, but we couldn’t see the outside as it was blocked by the boundary. I was telling Doom Caso to look at the boundary itself.</p>
<p>“We had a quarrel because you were rude to a superior monarch. That’s why I tried to scold you, but your resistance was so strong…so I had no choice but to kill you, maybe?”</p>
<p>“Maybe…? Are you not afraid of Doom Kaos? Other Demon Kings are going to be…”</p>
<p>“I am, but even if it’s Doom Kaos, it won’t be able to see through here.”</p>
<p>After all, this was a boundary made by the old power of the Old One. Even the great Doom Kaos couldn’t interfere unless it broke the boundary and came in here itself.</p>
<p>“And I think Doom Kaos will tolerate it. I think it’s better for him to make a vacancy for a new, strong Doom instead of someone who is just a bit stronger than Dragorin.”</p>
<p>“What…what the hell are you talking about?! You don’t even know much about me because you weren’t on the battlefield!”</p>
<p>I retorted, “I know that you were beaten by Saint Jayden. It looks like you have recovered, but the fact that you are still holding your breath and staying quiet is because you are scared of his bloodline, right? You are a disgrace to all Dooms.”</p>
<p>“You joined late, and you don’t even know what you are talking about! How would you be able to know the ferocity of that moment? Those on the higher ranks also had a difficult time. You weren’t even there, and it wasn’t a war where someone like you could jump to conclusions.”</p>
<p>I interrupted, “Have you seen the ‘Main Body’ of a Doom?”</p>
<p>“...What?”</p>
<p>“I have seen one from Doom Dejire. Doom Kaos was invading its thought process. You must have felt something during the procedure of getting your current position. That’s why I’m telling you. I killed Doom Dejire even when he was in his ‘Main Body’ even though I wasn’t even Doom then.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“If you want to take it out, feel free to do so. Do as much as you can, and realize how helpleless you are.”</p>
<p>“I am telling you again, but I have no intention to challenge…!”</p>
<p>“Let’s see how far you can resist!”</p>
<p>“You are actually doing this!”</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Ethereal Animal.]</p>
<p>Embers appeared and flared up. I flapped my wings as I leapt along with extreme heat. The speed at which the air heated up or the flames soared up couldn’t catch up with my pace. They only caught up after I stabbed the thunderstorm spear, getting stuck in its face. The lightning power struck him first, then the flames swept its face.</p>
<p>The whole place quickly became messy as the fire burned and the lightning power splashed everywhere. When Shiva’s Sword exploded in its face after my third consecutive attack, it lost its balance as it stood up. There was a boundary connected to the sky in the back, and its posture was bent naturally.</p>
<p>My three tails, Alpha, Beta, and Gamma weren’t long enough to wrap fu;ly around its limbs, so I was using them like weapons at the top of its head. Eventually, a part of its shield dissipated. I pierced my tails through its rough and thick fun, then stabbed them into its skin.</p>
<p>“Kwaaaaaaak-”</p>
<p>Despite shaking its head, I could only feel the force of wind pressing against me. Each time it tried to swat me away like a mosquito, lightning dragons persisted in emerging from the tip of the spear. They coiled around its fingers and wrists, seemingly determined to constrict and slice them.</p>
<p>Doom Caso was stomping its feet now. Instead of a meteor pouring out, fragments of the earth’s crust rose from below. However, even those were often scattered due to the wind pressure from his stomping, and my embers and lightning burned them down.</p>
<p>Its size was so immense that it resembled a volcano, with the debris floating in the air appearing like ash. Blood was boiling in the skin where I pierced, and when it soared, it looked as if a volcano erupted. Its blood even hit the ceiling of the boundary due to extreme pressure.</p>
<p>What I felt from it at the moment wasn’t Mana’s movement. There was something residing deeper inside it than Mana. I could barely sense its existence, but we both had the energy of Power, and it was bringing that out.</p>
<p>Had I been able to discern the type of flow it was using, similar to Mana, I could have replicated the Power it was attempting to wield. Unfortunately, I had yet to accomplish this skill.</p>
<p>It used its Power. A tinge of red was present, and in addition to its various hues, it differed from Mana in that it carried properties of fire, instilling a sense of eeriness simply by gazing upon it. I didn’t know in detail what it was in the past, but I knew now.</p>
<p>Originally, the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues had been on the verge of getting annihilated in the past. During that time, the First Evil activated the Man Who Overcomes Adversity, and the battle that lasted for several days was nearing the end.</p>
<p>However, right now Doom Caso was taking out its last resort after merely being beaten a few times. It seemed to have determined to fight me with all its strength as it realized it couldn’t confront me without using its entire power.</p>
<p>I now had two choices. One was avoiding it somehow, and the other was fighting back against it. I chose the second option as I intended to subjugate it. I needed to show a stronger power than Doom Caso!</p>
<p>As I folded my wings, the flames rising from my tails engulfed them. The spinning trajectory of Devi’s Sword placed me at its center, causing the clashing sounds of fire and metal to reverberate. In unison with these actions, Doom Caso also activated its skills at once. Then, its thick hair transformed to a fiery red hue.</p>
<p>As the sole target of the attack, every strand of its fur was aimed directly at me. Therefore, my mission was to swiftly impale each one with my spear. I couldn’t permit any form of intrusion upon my being!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was standing atop the fallen Doom Caso’s forehead and wielded the spear with lightning-like precision. Three blades slicing through the air. I was carving the ‘三’ symbol onto its forehead, and I shot embers from my wings whenever it attempted to move its limbs.</p>
<p>Although I had only unleashed embers, they transformed into a terrifying blaze upon impact with Doom Caso. Flames erupted from every direction, all stemming from the initial collision.</p>
<p>“S…stop!”</p>
<p>“Is this it? You are indeed a disgrace to all Dooms. I can tell why you are always getting beaten up.”</p>
<p>Expressing kindness, especially towards Doom Caso, wasn’t something that came easily to me. This was the best I could do after filtering my words.</p>
<p>“You lack Power to a great extent. I now understand how Doom Kaos thinks of you now because of your limitations.”</p>
<p>“Why are you…doing…this… If it’s because of your mainland…as you know…”</p>
<p>“You?” I guffawed.</p>
<p>I threw my spear at one of its eyes as soon as I pulled it out. Doom Caso screamed immediately. It tried floundering its limbs, but it soon realized that it would aggravate its pain. As I withdrew the spear from it, the lightning stem morphed into a hook, and with it, its eyeball also became dislodged. It barely managed to endure this. The time for it to maintain its form was short as it exploded.</p>
<p>Disgusting blood and fluid from the eyeball splattered in all directions.</p>
<p>“GAHHHHHH-! I am! I am so sorry! It’s all my fault, Doom… Doom Man…”</p>
<p>Finally, it called me in the right way while closing its remaining eye. It acted like it couldn’t bear to lose it.</p>
<p>“Let me ask you a question. How far do you think I will go up?” I asked.</p>
<p>“T…that is…”</p>
<p>“Fourth in rank, Doom Insectum. I am confident that I can go up to that far.”</p>
<p>“Of…of course… You deserve it.”</p>
<p>“But I’m not sure about from Doom Entegasto to Doom Kaos because they belong in a different realm than us. Then where should you be in the rank? How would you be able to survive in my grasp?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I am asking who can save you now.”</p>
<p>“Only you… Doom Man…”</p>
<p>“Then, there is only one thing left.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I will instill a kind of fear into you, such that you won’t be able to even make eye contact with me ever again.”</p>
<p>“The higher-ups will never tolerate this…!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I will make sure that you will never say that again.”</p>
<p>From now on.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 379</p>
<p>Despite knowing that Doom Caso would have no memories of inflicting despair upon humanity in the past during a time we were already struggling, I couldn’t help but feel incensed. That moment served as a stark realization that there was still room for us to descend further into despair.</p>
<p>Although the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues carried out a joint attack and the First Evil, who activated the Man Who Overcomes Adversity, drove Doom Caso out of the mainland, the destruction of one of humanity’s two largest surviving cities was disastrous. That destroyed city was the home base for the Eight Virtues.</p>
<p>Therefore, the previous war, which had been stopped as the Eight Virtues tried to occupy the surviving city of the Eight Evils, soon resumed after that. Just like that, humanity’s remaining time for survival had been shortened. It was the last period of the past from then on. In other words, it was the point that determined the middle and last period of the past.</p>
<p>It became more difficult for me to take care of my mother, so I had to give up on my aunt, who was my mother’s only friend. Since then, I never saw my mother smile again as she had to endure each day in disgusting survival facilities amongst other emotionless survivors.</p>
<p>That was the reason why I had provoked Doom Caso with a bunch of nonsense. If I didn’t do that, I felt like I wouldn’t be able to suppress myself from killing it. Just as I had snapped the neck of the First Evil!</p>
<p>I managed to stop shooting lightning from my spear. As I grappled with the notion that I shouldn’t kill it, my heart raced with a sense of withdrawal. My efforts to control my power only fueled my anger further. The more I attempted to calm myself down, the more my rage festered within.</p>
<p>However, Doom Caso was strangely quiet. It was then I realized that it had stopped making any noise after being beaten successively.</p>
<p>Did it die?</p>
<p>There was no way. I felt a movement and looked back at it. Its remaining eye was slowly opening.</p>
<p>“...What is your grudge with me?”</p>
<p>The voice was the same, but it had a different vibe to it. It was no longer a guy who was frightened by ruthless violence.</p>
<p>“Keeeeuk-! I am! I am so sorry! It’s all my fault, Doom… Doom Man…”</p>
<p>Doom Caso wasn’t the same guy who had crawled and begged me to spare its life earlier.</p>
<p>I quickly suppressed my anger, then flew up in the air where I could look down at it at one glance. Physically, its condition was the same. The lash marks remained where they were, and blood continued to flow from the wounds inflicted by the indiscriminate lightning strikes.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Doom Caso.”</p>
<p>I snapped, “You know that I am not asking you that.”</p>
<p>“Do you think bringing me to my knees would help you… This is not worth it for you.”</p>
<p>Its tone was resigned, and its pupil no longer chased after me. It was hopeless and devastated. All it did was look at the boundary above it.</p>
<p>The anger that shook my body vanished for a moment because Doom Caso was indeed acting strangely by all accounts.</p>
<p>“I am going to ask you again. Who are you?”</p>
<p>“Ca-lak-too.”</p>
<p>Only then did its eyes move after me. There was a question in its remaining weak eye.</p>
<p>“Odin.”</p>
<p>“Odin.”</p>
<p>“Who called me earlier?”</p>
<p>“Simply a character who had replaced me for a long time. He is quite eager to talk about cooperation with you. He is short-sighted, but has lots of beneficial personalities. Thanks to him, I was able to meet you like this. This was something that I couldn’t have done by myself.”</p>
<p>I frowned. “New character? Why do you even need that?”</p>
<p>“Our bowl is small, and we can’t follow the eternal life of Doom Kaos like Doom Arukuda or Doom Entegasto. Beings like us should have a simple process of thoughts. Odin, you must not be buried in time… You may not understand the story now, but you will in the future.”</p>
<p>I already knew that Doom Caso could handle mental skills to some extent, and it seemed to have been using it for a long time.</p>
<p>“One thing I don’t understand is why you hold so much anger against me. It was an act of subjugating me with your personal feelings. It is true that I was appointed commander of the Allied Corps that invaded your mainland, but that ended up not working at the beginning phase. You are too much.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“You killed my soldiers, and in the last battle, you killed more of my generals and my men. Compared to that, your mainland has only suffered a minimum amount of damage. What is your reason? Why do you want to kill me so bad? And why have you not killed me yet? Do you think it’s possible to obtain whatever you want by subjugating me? No one can challenge the throne of Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>Its giant eye was filled with a sense of time that seemed to stretch on endlessly. It emitted a sigh, like that of a weary old soldier who had fought in a long and arduous war. The voice that emerged from the monster’s body resembled that of an elder who had experienced much of life. It was then that I acknowledged that I had underestimated Doom Caso.</p>
<p>“How did you obtain the power to kill Doom Dejire? How could you outdo me in a short time? I am not convinced at all, Odin.”</p>
<p>That was what it really wanted to ask.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Suffering wasn’t something one could become accustomed to; it could only be endured. Continual exposure to pain had the capacity to erode even the most resilient of egos. A strong will, like that of steel, was bound to break eventually, whether it be through physical or mental violence.</p>
<p>I had seen many individuals crumble in a similar fashion. They had been defeated by underestimating the Seven Demon Kings, assuming that their physiques and spirits were comparable to that of humans.</p>
<p>The notion that there could exist no state beyond pain remained unaltered. I just had to put in as much effort as it had lived. I had no choice but to give up on subjugating it in a short time, so then I decided to kill it.</p>
<p>I was about to start by telling it ‘I am a Past Life Returner.’ I planned to bring out its true story after telling it my entire life since I was going to kill it.</p>
<p>However, it continued speaking after closing its one eye.</p>
<p>“Please stop. I just wanted to complain and ask you to understand my situation. If you kill me, then Doom Kaos will punish you no matter what. Don’t let him get angry at you. There is no benefit to you, Odin.”</p>
<p>It couldn’t read my mind due to its weak mentality, but it was quick-witted.</p>
<p>“All the monarchs on the rankings aspire to have the power of Doom Kaos. That’s something that naturally occurs, so Doom Kaos doesn’t mind it. However, the one thing he doesn’t tolerate is fighting amongst ourselves without his approval.”</p>
<p>I commented, “You are talking like you know much about Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>“No, despite having lived for many years, my knowledge about him would be as limited as yours.”</p>
<p>“That means you know nothing. How come you don’t know anything when you have spent so much time together?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It can’t be helped. I haven’t reached the third step yet, so I can only sense their presence as they remain concealed behind a curtain. Their battles extended far beyond the reaches of this battlefield, in areas that were beyond my recognition. You will come to realize this once you attend the meeting. The war has been reignited, and the meeting will be convened shortly, affording us the opportunity to see them. All that is left to do is wait.”</p>
<p>There was a such thing called ‘meeting’ among entities like them.</p>
<p>“I’d like to hear more about it. How are the other Dooms?”</p>
<p>“I can’t even mention Doom Entegasto, the monarch on the third staircase. But I can say that those up to the fourth step are similar to me. Doom Insectum, Doom Mount, and high-ranking monarchs.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean that they are similar to you?” I asked.</p>
<p>“They, too, are enduring and preserving themselves through the years with their newly acquired personas. The time will come when you will have to undergo a similar transformation. Failure to do so will result in the fading away of all the blood and desires that currently drive you, leaving nothing in their wake. Don’t forget that we are vulnerable, Odin. This is the second point that Doom Kaos never tolerates. We must be in a position to accept his orders and not to be abandoned.”</p>
<p>Its every single word contained remorse and regret. Maybe all it had left was its survival instinct and its real name. The spoils of Dooms like vitality, soul, and earth of the dimension were all occupied by the high-ranked monarchs, and Doom Caso had been dragged around many warzones with stagnant growth.</p>
<p>But did I feel bad for it? No. It was the same as the Old One and Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>I asked while looking down at its giant body, “Are you a Declan?”</p>
<p>“The Declans are soldiers who worship me.”</p>
<p>“But you look like a Declan. What happened to that?”</p>
<p>When considering the abilities of the Dooms, one common thread was apparent in both Doom Caso and Doom Dejire: they appeared as their own followers. Therefore, Doom Dejire was as small as the Lunea Clan, and Doom Caso was gigantic as the Declans. The notion that the Dooms could potentially move about among their followers remained a persistent concern in my thoughts.</p>
<p>In order to uncover the secrets of dealing with Power, I needed to know each of Doom's abilities in detail. When I asked about that point, Doom Caso answered, “Transfer of Souls. It is a common power that we have. We have a similar appearance as our worshippers, as Doom Insectum had advised. But Odin. Power is not to be gained by oneself. Instead, it is only permitted.”</p>
<p>“Do you really think so?”</p>
<p>I was aware of its intention. What would be the reason for it to give me advice and answer questions even when it was tired of its current life. It was not much different from me.</p>
<p>Our objectives may have differed, but we both sought to attain higher positions, preferably up to the level of Doom Entegasto. We aimed to secure the spoils of the Dooms and achieve divinity without the need to forge a new persona. Our aspiration was to possess a strength that would endure even if we were to live for an eternity, unaffected by the passage of time.</p>
<p>I could feel those emotions from its complaints.</p>
<p>“There are many forces that have not been collected in your old battlefield, which is here. Also, the Old One is here too. If we can retrieve everything, then it’s not impossible to challenge Doom Kaos’s throne.”</p>
<p>I then called it by its real name, “Calaktoo. I guarantee you will never escape from being a slave, but I’m strong. I will become more powerful by utilizing the resources left here, and I will obtain enough power to challenge the throne. Didn’t you see that possibility in me? It’s something that you can’t achieve.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“You would know best that only pain exists under Doom Kaos. You will forever be the same without someone leading you.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Doom Caso. Doom Insectum and Doom Mount wouldn’t be in a different situation. That would stay the same until I took full control of the Seven Demon Kings like how I had engulfed the Bilderberg Club and completed Jeonil Club!</p>
<p>“I don’t care whether it is your new persona, or your own. Swear obedience to me and wait.”</p>
<p>“Doom Insectum is the highest of us, and it is completely different from me.”</p>
<p>“Then I will just kill it and fill it with ‘My Doom.’ The new Doom will be under you, so it is a good thing to you, too.”</p>
<p>“Odin…”</p>
<p>“I shall become the monarch who attains immortality, wielding a harmonious power derived from both the Dooms and the Old One simultaneously. I will ascend the throne and summon you to join me on the higher level.”</p>
<p>Roar!</p>
<p>The Wings of Flame spread out.</p>
<p>Zing-</p>
<p>The lightning that carried my voice struck in all directions.</p>
<p>“Obey me, Calaktoo.”</p>
<p>The order will be reorganized soon.</p>

<p>Chapter 380</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong handed a document over that contained information about one of the most important assets of the company.</p>
<p>「Classification: Pangyo Grande City, Office Building</p>
<p>Real Estate Location: 1032 Baekhyun-dong, Bundang-gu, Seongnam-si, Pangyo</p>
<p>Total Size of the Area: 7,447m²/110,596m²</p>
<p>Size of the Building: Underground 7th floor ― Ground 16th floor</p>
<p>Completion Date: December 2017」</p>
<p>「Appraisal Amount: KRW 549,410,000,000</p>
<p>Annual Rent: KRW 24,491,293,000 」</p>
<p>“What about this? What did you do?”</p>
<p>Her father pretended not to know why his daughter was clinging to him.</p>
<p>She whined, "Dad, just trust your daughter this time. I'm gonna start with the capital, and even though I can't promise huge profits, I'll make sure we don't lose any money. You know I always keep my promises, right?"</p>
<p>He shook his head. “You know nothing about this world.”</p>
<p>However, Ga-Yeong had no intention of giving up today. Last week she met with the strongest person among the team leaders of the association’s Korean branch. Not only was she able to obtain lots of information from the industry, but she was also able to meet Mr. Cho, the manager of Daehyun CA.</p>
<p>As a result of meeting a few more people and collecting data, Ga-Yeong concluded that it was worth betting on the business of entering outer space.</p>
<p>She was relentless in her persuasion. It wasn’t until she brought up the profit that Daehyun CA had been keeping as a secret fund that her father began to waver in his resistance.</p>
<p>“Are you sure this won’t cause any trouble?” he asked hesitantly.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to find a partner because everyone is leaning towards llsung. Even the Great Jeonil is behind them, so Daehyun said if we join, they will support us. Think about it. They wouldn’t have suggested this only to us, but to others. They will find someone else if we respond late.”</p>
<p>“Ga-Yeong.”</p>
<p>“Is it because of the largest shareholder? What is your honest opinion?” she asked.</p>
<p>He sighed. “It’s going to be a big problem if things go wrong.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “No, just tell me what you think.”</p>
<p>“I’m saying that my personal opinion doesn’t matter. Put yourself into my shoes. I let you do whatever you wanted since you were running your business pretty well, but now you are jumping into an agency? Did you think I would say yes right away?”</p>
<p>“I really want to see their faces for once.”</p>
<p>“So you are doing this just to see their faces?” he asked.</p>
<p>She smiled weakly., “Well, kind of.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“I should clean my business up one day.”</p>
<p>Her father lectured, “We should be the most thankful for people who are in outer space. Without them, I wouldn’t have been able to raise you like this. Also, you know whom to repay the favor to, right? If you have any energy to do this absurd thing, then focus on finding him.”</p>
<p>“I am…but he is like a ghost. No one knows anything about him.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, you should do your best whatever you do. Don’t let others talk shit about you. You should prove your capability to them.”</p>
<p>“So you mean…yes?”</p>
<p>That conversation occurred one month ago.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Iljoo Construction was one of the top twenty construction corporations in Korea. Ga-Yeong believed that the company’s growth was solely attributed to her father’s efforts, but upon reflection, it was no different from other conglomerates.</p>
<p>The company wasn’t named after Jeonil Group, Jonathan, and Gillian Finance Investment Group, but foreign capital had also had a part in Iljoo Construction.</p>
<p>However, the difference between them and other companies with foreign capital was that the major shareholder never showed his face to them. Since he had delegated a 1.1 percent stake that granted them voting rights, he remained absent from the company’s operations, except when he conducted audits through foreign tax firms once in a while.</p>
<p>Things had been the same for twenty years, and Ga-Yeong had never heard of such an investment capital other than them. She checked her father’s mailbox and scratched her forehead. The emails were only about the national land restoration project, but the response she had been waiting for hadn’t arrived yet.</p>
<p>At that time, she received a call.</p>
<p>&lt;You have a…guest.&gt;</p>
<p>The voice of the employee in the lobby was trembling in excitement.</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: Who is it?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lobby staff: Umm…It’s Mr. Kwon Seong-Il.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: Ca…Caliber? Why?&gt;</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong burst into a scream without realizing it.</p>
<p>&lt;Lobby staff: He said that he received a call.&gt;</p>
<p>She had sent messages to all the Awakened throughout Asia, but Caliber?!</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong couldn’t hear the staff over the phone as her mind went blank.</p>
<p>&lt;Lobby staff: ...him up?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: Sorry?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lobby staff: Should I send him up?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: No, it’s okay. I will go down.&gt;</p>
<p>She waited for the elevator for a few seconds, but ended up running down the emergency stairs.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man standing in the lobby was indeed Caliber. He was like the unidentified foreign major shareholder as it was undeniable that he existed, but it somehow felt like he was an imaginary being.</p>
<p>In fact, that was how the world worked these days. Alien monsters had appeared on the Day of Advent and were exterminated.</p>
<p>The fact that they had broken through the cosmic phenomenon called ‘gate’ and destroyed Gunpo, Anyang, and Gwacheon was real. In fact, it happened only three months ago, but the cities that were demolished then were not very far from Seoul. Ga-Yeong had actually escaped to the air defense shelter with her parents at that time.</p>
<p>However, that was it. Alien monsters were still considered elusive entities, only accessible through social media, and were considered to be far from the realm of reality. Also, the two hundred Korean Awakened who had shot them down and the World Awakened Association Headquarters in this country were out of touch with reality.</p>
<p>The only aspect that made her feel connected to reality was her involvement in the national land restoration project. However, the actual work was managed by a separate department.</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong was overcome with emotion as a person who established the agency because Caliber, who was previously a fictional character to her, had appeared before her. The pictures of individuals working at the gold mine that the Daehyun Group had secretly shown her flooded her mind.</p>
<p>However, there were also photos of a brutal battlefield. The Awakened were standing on corpses and soaked in blood. Even the ordinary Awakened were terrifying, but Caliber was the most powerful and scariest among them.</p>
<p>Caliber Kwon Seong-Il…</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong decided to pull herself together right before she stood in front of him.</p>
<p>“I came here to see Mr. Choi. Who are you?” he asked.</p>
<p>She responded quickly. “I’m his daughter.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il raised an eyebrow. “Mr. Choi’s daughter?”</p>
<p>She nodded rapidly. “Yes.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “Haha. You didn’t need to come down. I’m not that special. Let’s go up.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong blinked her eyes quickly as she didn’t expect this.</p>
<p>My dad knows him? Then he would have let me know beforehand.</p>
<p>“He is not here now. May I ask what brought you here?” she asked politely.</p>
<p>He gestured. “I just came to visit as I heard he established an agency.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong replied immediately, “If that’s the reason, then you can talk to me about it. Then, I will tell my dad that you are here. Thanks for coming, Mr. Caliber. This way, please.”</p>
<p>She guided him to the office. Right after that, Ga-Yeong used the excuse of needing to use the washroom as a means of calling her dad.</p>
<p>&lt;Mr.Choi: I don’t know him. I actually don’t. He must have mistaken me for someone else. How would such a person know me?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: He used to own a company called ‘Ki-Cheol Construction,’ and had joined many of our company’s projects. You actually hired them directly.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Mr.Choi: I really don’t remember him. They must have been subcontracted. It’s the only logical explanation since neither of us knows his company. Huh… I can’t believe this.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: Okay. Just let me know if you remember or find something, Dad.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Mr.Choi: Okay, I will try my best.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ga-Yeong: Hurry up, Dad. You should come as soon as possible.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Mr. Choi: Yeah, I’m on my way.&gt;</p>
<p>In her school years, she didn’t know what the IMF was, so she had no idea what kind of difficulties her father had experienced back then.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Mr. Choi could never forget those days. ‘Thrift and saving’ was his company’s motto, and if he saw workers who reminded him of the old days, he always supported them even by making his company’s legal team help them.</p>
<p>There were multiple construction companies that were born like that, and Ki-Cheol Construction was one of them.</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong quickly fixed her makeup and returned to the office, and the sight of Seong-Il looking at the sunset came into her view. His back was as big as the sunset.</p>
<p>He remarked, “I don’t think there is a need for Mr. Choi to come. I just wanted to thank him in person, but I should have called first.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. “Umm…”</p>
<p>He continued, “I didn’t mean to eavesdrop, but you know, the Awakened possess heightened auditory perception. I’m just telling you not to make any mistakes since you are running an agency. I don’t really care, but some Awakened people are sensitive.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong was already aware of it, therefore she had installed a soundproofing system and whispered on the phone. She looked at Seong-Il with a flushed face. Seong-Il acted as if he would leave immediately, but instead, he sat on a couch.</p>
<p>“I don’t smell any Awakened here. Is your agency not doing well?” he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. “Ah, yes. As you can tell.”</p>
<p>“Tae-Han has nothing to do with Ilsung now, but they know nothing. Don’t be sad. They will recognize your sincerity one day.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong smiled to express her appreciation for his words.</p>
<p>She hesitated and then asked, “But what brought you here again? With all due respect… I wonder if there is anything we can do for you, Mr. Caliber.”</p>
<p>“There ought to be a balance of give and take. Mr. Choi has bestowed countless gifts to people, some of which he may have forgotten, but those who have been recipients of his kindness will remember him forever.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong thought and realized that her father had also received kindness from two people in the past. One was the foreign capital, who remained the major shareholder of Iljoo Construction, and the other was a young man who had connected him with the capital and helped him win many projects. Iljoo Construction had survived and grown to this extent thanks to the two.</p>
<p>“However, we are too small to help someone like you, Mr. Caliber…” she said wryly.</p>
<p>“Listen until I get to the end.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m not telling you I will join your agency and take the land now. I just want to leave some stuff here.”</p>
<p>She asked, “Are you talking about item trading?”</p>
<p>“If your trading system is decent, then I can go into outer space and occupy some lands. Well, as long as Iljoo Construction is prepared to the level that I want you to be. Let’s talk about that later after I see the results. Is this too much?”</p>
<p>She responded honestly, “Which company in the world would not be bewildered by Mr. Caliber’s offer? That’s a lie if they tell you such a thing. Honestly, it’s such a burden for companies with low brand value like us.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong rolled up her sleeves to show her goosebumps.</p>
<p>He chuckled “It’s written all over your face that you are exaggerating. Why don’t you give it a try? Don’t be intimidated by my name and fame, Miss.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Okay? Also, I’m only telling you this, but I like Iljoo Construction. I don’t understand those who haven’t learned Korean yet, and I don’t want to work with them. So the choices I have left are: Jeonil, Ilsung, Daehyun, and their small companies. They are all the same to me, so I’m trying to pay off my debt to Mr. Choi. So don’t feel pressured.”</p>
<p>“What stuff are you talking about?” she asked.</p>
<p>He explained, “They are artifacts, so they are not authentic items that Awakened carries around. Have you heard about it?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Although they are not named after gods, I can guarantee their power. There won’t be any issue with the value. I have so many of them. If you treat them well, then I will let you take care of more stuff. Do you want to try?”</p>
<p>Her eyes lit up. “...Yes. Thank you for giving me this chance, Mr. Caliber.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “Good choice. I made the agencies sign the contract, so the agency that I’m currently working for will send you the document. Check it out and send it to me after editing.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“If you do well, then your agency will grow with me and expand more. I mean it.”</p>
<p>Ga-Yeong checked the reality only after Seong-Il left.</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, this is crazy. It was really Caliber…</p>
<p>It wasn’t her time to do this. She needed to contact the numbers on her phone first.</p>
<p>People who used to work as auction brokers at Sotheby’s[1] and those from the hedge funds on Wall Street had founded companies, waiting for this day to come. Ga-Yeong’s job was to choose the most reliable company among them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Did you really leave your artifacts there? Really?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shrugged. “I just wanted to check if her agency was competent or not. We will find that out soon.”</p>
<p>“Gosh… That’s your choice, but keep one thing in mind: we should earn lots of money. It’s not just about the item.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il nodded. “I know.”</p>
<p>“We can earn much more from the battlefield. You know that, right?”</p>
<p>“Let’s say that we join all the wars and scrape every single penny we can. Do you want us to beg for mercy from that guy?”</p>
<p>“Begging is an inappropriate term to use here. That simply means we are worshiping that motherfucker. Let’s call it ‘trade’ between us. It’s not wrong to say that.”</p>
<p>“I would have torn the others apart if Odin wasn’t there. Aren’t we supposed to deal with all these only with our, the priests’, money? We should collect money from everyone, not just the priests…”</p>
<p>“We should wait and see about that. It’s not that Odin is inflexible.”</p>
<p>“Nah, Odin doesn’t really change his mind. Anyway, if we save money, then what should we earn with that?”</p>
<p>“We should wait and see about that, too. We should think about what will help Odin the most. Let’s fill our pockets first and wait.”</p>
<p>“Hmm… Okay. By the way, why would it name the ritual ‘Mammonism?’ This bastard knows us too well, and it’s embarrassing.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I don’t like that either.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Noona. Doom Kaos is just a fucking asshole.”</p>

<p>Chapter 381</p>
<p>「World Awakened Association</p>
<p>“Get ready to rebuild, Awakened!”</p>
<p>…Exchange is Officially Launched Today!</p>
<p>The World Awakened Association (WAA) has announced the launch of ‘I-Trade,’ a commerce platform for the trading of supernatural objects called ‘items’ and ‘insignias’ among the Awakened. The platform will be launched on July 4th at 10 P.M. (Korea Standard Time) and will be available through the ‘Exchange I’ operated by the WAA secretariat.</p>
<p>According to Liam Vanon, the Secretary General of the WAA, the platform will allow for free real-time purchases and sales of these items through the use of virtual electronic wallets. This will provide a secure and convenient means for Awakened to obtain and sell supernatural products.</p>
<p>In addition, he explained that this system is among the association’s supportive policies, which enables the Awakened to view ‘rebuilding’ not as a burden but rather as an opportunity for active transactions with cooperative partners. He also issued a stern warning, stating that the association would take the highest level of disciplinary action against any forces engaging in excessive purchases.</p>
<p>Deposits and withdrawals for virtual electronic wallets can be made through SOB and partner banks under Jonathan Investment Finance Group, the global financial group. Also, transactions are limited to companies that hold partnerships with the association.</p>
<p>In order to successfully settle the transaction system Exchange I, ▲ the association plans to ensure equal access to information by making the system that reveals information obtained by Exchange I available to all relevant parties ▲ the association has established a disciplinary system to address obstructive activities, including ‘refusal to transfer’ ▲ the association has taken responsibility for organizing and guaranteeing all matters related to the delivery of goods.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One building of the headquarters, which used to be Jeonil Resort, was empty for guests and the Awakened visiting the headquarters. It was already crowded with visitors with ID cards around their necks when I arrived. They seemed to have been dispatched from agents or private military companies to check transaction information in real-time on the spot.</p>
<p>In other words, they were elites of the groups that were in the high rank in the global business community. Therefore, restaurants and cafes had turned into their conference places just by exchanging business cards with each other. Their table was stacked with transaction lists while the food was cooling down.</p>
<p>Of course, food wouldn’t be able to catch their attention now.</p>
<p>Millions and billions of dollars were moving through their mouths.</p>
<p>Upon arriving at the suite on the top floor, Yeon-Hee greeted me while lying in bed with her stomach resting on it and her laptop open in front of her. The entire bed sheet was filled with the Kciphos’s fur.</p>
<p>I tried to tell her what happened with Doom Caso, but she looked discouraged by the numbers spinning in front of her. Lee Tae-Han had given me an update on the situation about a week after its opening, so I had a rough idea of what was going on.</p>
<p>Even though I didn’t ask if she won or lost money, her expression made it obvious that she lost money at a glance. She had an embarrassed smile on her face and soon turned her body to face the ceiling. Then, she rubbed her eyes as she was exhausted from looking at the monitor.</p>
<p>「Total balance : ＄92,000,000 」</p>
<p>「Products in possession: Helmet of Swirling Darkness B (Trading in process), Training Hammer of Ronsius’s Magic Tower E (Trading in process), Reinforcement B (Waiting for acquisition), Reinforcement B (Waiting for acquisition), Reinforcement B (Waiting for acquisition), Reinforcement B (Waiting for acquisition), Reinforcement B (Waiting for acquisition), Reinforcement B (Waiting for acquisition) 」</p>
<p>I said after checking her monitor, “But you have close to one hundred million dollars, don’t you?”</p>
<p>She grumbled, “If I had left it alone, it would have been close to five hundred million by now. I thought it wouldn’t go up, but it suddenly soared the day before yesterday. Where is this money coming from?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “You should have waited until the market price was formed or waited for me.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle as Yeon-Hee was being attacked online despite being able to easily seduce anyone in person.</p>
<p>As I had mentioned earlier, the past week was all about the process of forming market prices. The Awakened weren’t leading the market right now. Instead, the capital forces that employed them had been steadily inflating the size of the market, so none of the Awakened had accumulated such wealth.</p>
<p>Therefore, the market price formed as of today could be summarized as follows.</p>
<p>Class F, $20,000</p>
<p>Class E, $60,000</p>
<p>Class D, $200,000</p>
<p>Class C, $1.5 million</p>
<p>Class B, $12 million</p>
<p>Class A, $150 million</p>
<p>Most of the Awakened were in the platinum section, so the cost to fully arm one of them was around twelve million dollars, which translated to twelve billion won in Korean currency. Likewise, having an Awakened in the master section get fully armed with A-class equipment was the same as having 1.2 trillion won. Considering that one multi-purpose stealth bomber was three trillion won, the Awakened had a better value.</p>
<p>Although it was probable that the current market price would experience only minor fluctuations, as the profit model for outer space drew closer to completion, the value of the items would inevitably rise.</p>
<p>「The transaction has been completed. (Sales)」</p>
<p>「Training Hammer of Ronsius’s Magic Tower (Item E): ＄64,300」</p>
<p>「Total balance: ＄92,064,300」</p>
<p>A notification alarm rang one more time on Yeon-Hee’s laptop.</p>
<p>「The selected product has been registered.」</p>
<p>「Name: Reinforcement</p>
<p>Category: Insignia</p>
<p>Class: A</p>
<p>Selling price: $ 60,000,000</p>
<p>Seller: Alex Brown</p>
<p>* Precautions for Transaction</p>
<p>1. The next transaction can arrive only after the receipt of the product is confirmed by insignia.</p>
<p>2. The seller is prohibited from using the balance of the purchase amount until the acquisition has been finalized.</p>
<p>3. Please pay special attention to the fact that insignia trading is very different from item trading.」</p>
<p>Unfortunately, trading insignias was more inconvenient, but it couldn’t be helped. In the case of items, after the transaction was complete, the association branch of each country assumed responsibility until the buyer was released, and ultimately delivered the item to the person who bought it.</p>
<p>The reason for using this system was to increase the size of the transactions. Rather than encouraging speculation, it was to increase the value of the Awakened. Prices had to be high to ensure their profits in the future. Also, if there were artifacts in outer space, then the group of Awakened who succeeded in occupying the area of those artifacts deserved substantial wealth.</p>
<p>Without the involvement of capital forces, the transaction would only be limited to between the Awakened, so the current prices of the items would have been different. After all, most of the initial transactions came from those who didn’t want to enter the Cat Food Warehouse or outer space.</p>
<p>Now, those who had been just watching the market situation started to join, so the volume of products was exploding crazily.</p>
<p>Rebuilding was a process of disposing of unnecessary items and finding ones that were more suitable and beneficial for an Awakened. Profit was the process of disposing of spoils acquired at outer space. Trading was the process of making profits by using market fluctuations of the products. Such processes had been combined, so the trading system was successfully settling down.</p>
<p>Of course, if an individual or a group attempted to dominate the market, they would be strictly punished. If any of the club’s members had that kind of greed, then their families would be exterminated.</p>
<p>Appropriate purchases and sales would be tolerated for the revitalization of the market.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I returned to the mainland not only to check on the trading system with my own eyes, but also to participate in the trading. No S-class items had been posted since the market had opened.</p>
<p>The Cat Food Warehouse was filled with items, so I was paying attention to insignias instead. Insignias were a rarity, particularly those of higher level, which were even scarcer. That was natural because most people opted for items or skills rather than insignias as insignias disappeared after using them. Furthermore, those who had chosen to get insignias from rewards had exhausted them whenever their lives were in danger.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the current market didn’t consider the rarity of insignias yet, so the price wasn’t as high as I had expected. Moreover, items were being traded continuously, but insignias were being shunned. Those who intended to buy insignias were people who would actually use them, but most of them could only use low-class as they weren’t in the higher sections.</p>
<p>For instance, the following A-class insignia would never be used by ordinary Awakened unless they were healers.</p>
<p>「Name: The Land of Sacred Healing</p>
<p>Category: Insignia</p>
<p>Class: A</p>
<p>Selling price: $ 45,000,000</p>
<p>Seller: Lucy」</p>
<p>However, if someone had an insignia like this when the Spirit King of Fire had appeared in the duchy, the sacrifices could have been minimized.</p>
<p>「The transaction has been completed.」</p>
<p>There was a reason why insignias were one-shot, as the power contained within that particular one was enormous in comparison to its value of just forty-five million dollars.</p>
<p>I continued shopping as I wanted to fill all my vacancies with ten insignias. Also, I was thinking of studying the movement of Mana in the insignia if possible.</p>
<p>I suddenly interjected, “It’s still just an assumption.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked away from her monitor to me. Although the number of products she could purchase was limited like me, she was enjoying the situation in which items she had never heard of were pouring out.</p>
<p>I continued, “Insignias must be formed of Mana. That means we can supply and demand Mana.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee knew what I meant. She had witnessed how far I could handle Mana when I dismantled my skills and concentrated Mana within them into Hanuman’s Tail. That was how I created Odin’s Ethereal Animal.</p>
<p>What if I operated Mana in the insignias with the same method?</p>
<p>The problem was no one knew how much Mana was contained in insignias. In addition, it was difficult to obtain insignias due to their scarcity, and it required considerable manpower and time to study.</p>
<p>「The transaction has been completed. (Purchase)」</p>
<p>「Teleportation (Insignia B): $ 6,000,000」</p>
<p>Besides the supply and demand of Mana, I wanted to check the blueprint in the insignias.</p>
<p>As I was concluding my shopping, I pondered over which association employee would be the ideal candidate to deliver the insignias on my behalf. At that time, Yeon-Hee let out a short cry. She was looking at the same thing as me.</p>

<p>Prices were skyrocketing as soon as it was announced.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it the main item of the Eighth Evil?”</p>
<p>The trading system had a fixed-price system, but there were exceptions on S-class items. But the first item that started the auction was Xi Wangmu’s Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider… I wondered who had this.</p>
<p>I expected a series of extraordinary items would appear on the market, but this was quite surprising.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:01 ― $ 1,500,000,000」</p>
<p>I had to get it no matter what. No matter which guys dared show off their money in front of me, this was mine.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 382</p>
<p>A vacant two-lane asphalt road cut through the land and extended ahead. A section of the road that passed through the pine forest terminated at a villa that was formerly used by a hunter.</p>
<p>The broker had asserted that it was ideal for hunting due to the various colonies of untamed creatures scattered beyond the mountains, but Kayden simply desired to distance himself from the city.</p>
<p>Adapting to city life was challenging for him, likely due to his low rank. Whenever he encountered conceited agencies who belittled him, he couldn’t help but feel angry. They were clueless about the Stage of Advent, yet they pretended to be more knowledgeable than him. The Awakened and mercenaries were the ones handling violent conflicts in outer space, not those who believed they were on par by simply jotting down figures a few times on a document.</p>
<p>Idiots. I would never let them determine my life and death and handle my item tradings.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t have been so infuriated if those companies had demonstrated significant accomplishments in their past attempts at conquering land. Nonetheless, there were several instances where he desired to teach them a harsh lesson, yet he had no other option but to restrain himself when he considered the consequences of offending the Safety Bureau of the association.</p>
<p>Today was just another mundane day for Kayden. He was disheartened as he had been unsuccessful in finding a suitable agency or military company.</p>
<p>As he made his way back to the villa, it was dark outside since it was nighttime. However, since the Awakened possessed the ability to see through the darkness, there was no need for him to use the car’s high beam.</p>
<p>However, Kayden switched on the car’s high beams when he noticed a man wandering in front of the villa. The man had a powerful scent of the Awakened, so Kayden wanted to warn him with the light. As expected, the moment the man hit the ground forcefully, the entire ground in the vicinity quaked.</p>
<p>Kayden checked the man’s face and got out of the car. Then, he showed his left arm to the man. To be precise, he was trying to convey a message by revealing the spot where the microchip was implanted.</p>
<p>This is not the Stage of Advent, and this world is governed by the rules of the Association. No matter who you are, you can’t control my life and death.</p>
<p>Then, the man smirked as if it was funny and raised his left hand. He was Imir, the vice-captain of Kayden’s squad in the Final Stage. Kayden was about to ask how he found him, but stopped himself. Since Imir had been in a high social status before entering the Stage, it would have been easy for him to make connections with the association.</p>
<p>“What brought you here?” Kayden asked.</p>
<p>Imir didn’t answer his question and instead said, “You don’t seem happy to see me.”</p>
<p>He looked around the darkened villa surroundings before continuing, “Did you spend all your support fund in this old villa?”</p>
<p>Kayden shrugged. “Where else would I have gotten the money? Before that… Why are you here looking for me?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so defensive. I’m here to talk about something constructive.”</p>
<p>Kayden’s Sense was naturally focused on Imir as the other man suddenly took out his ring and threw it at him. Kayden grabbed the ring in the air.</p>
<p>The other man explained, “It’s an advance payment.”</p>
<p>Nowadays, the item window didn’t appear even with Night Eyes activated. However, determining the item’s class was not challenging, even if the exact level was unknown. When Kayden activated his Sixth Sense, a brilliant light fluttered from the ring. Despite the absence of a diamond set in the ring that refracted light, it exuded a gorgeous radiance akin to one.</p>
<p>A B-class accessory?</p>
<p>Seeing that it made him more sensitive, he knew that the ring had the ability to raise one’s Sense.</p>
<p>Imir said, “Join us as soon as possible after you finish rebuilding, Kayden.”</p>
<p>“Which company do you belong to?” Kayden asked, somewhat suspicious.</p>
<p>Imir waved a hand. “You will be satisfied. Odin ruled the Stage of Advent, but there is someone else who has governed our mainland for a long time before the Stage. This is a capitalist world. His strength is comparable to Odin here.”</p>
<p>“...Is it the King of Hell?”</p>
<p>Imir nodded proudly. “Yes, we are with super-large capital, the Jonathan Investment Finance Group.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>East Potomac Park in Washington D.C.</p>
<p>The park was renowned for its cherry blossoms due to the cherry blossom trees that were gifted by Japan during the imperial era, which symbolized amicable relations between the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>The U.S. acknowledged Japan’s control of Korea, and Japan acknowledged the U.S.’s control of the Philippines. If Japan had not committed the invasion of Pearl Harbor, then the park would have been filled with sculptures symbolizing the friendship between the United States and Japan.</p>
<p>What if the Stage of Advent didn’t take place? What if the power of WAA was much weaker than it was now?</p>
<p>Under those assumptions, it would have been impossible to relocate the heart of Washington, encompassing this entire park, with the White House nearby, to the territory of the association. Additionally, such a sign wouldn’t have existed if that was the case.</p>
<p>「Warning</p>
<p>Civilian Restricted Area:</p>
<p>This area is subject to the World Awakened Association Member Status Agreement and is strictly prohibited from unauthorized individuals’ entry.</p>
<p>World Awakened Association</p>
<p>― United States branch 」</p>
<p>Kayden couldn’t help thinking about the King of Hell as he went through the entry procedure. This man was the head of the supermassive group who defended on the Day of Advent. His assets were so vast that they were beyond estimation, and he possessed an unparalleled degree of influence over the world.</p>
<p>What would have motivated the WAA to stifle the activities of Awakened on the mainland and incorporate private civilian capital into their realm? It was possible that the King of Hell was in charge of the association, not Odin. Kayden thought Odin wouldn’t have left the mainland in this peace if he was the leader.</p>
<p>That was what mattered. The rules were the same here like in the Stage of Advent as the low-class Awakened didn’t know the situation between higher-ups in the leadership. Therefore, he had to remain firm with his decision without being swayed by the flow.</p>
<p>Now, Kayden was proud of himself for not rushing to sign contracts with other companies. If it was the King of Hell, then his vision was guaranteed!</p>
<p>He completed registering and evaluating his items in the United States branch, and it was now late evening. The only people who walked around the branch, which used to be a park, were the Awakened or properly trained U.S. soldiers. Therefore, it was much better than a city where morons were gathered. They were weak and wouldn’t have survived without the Awakened. No one gave him funny or scared looks in the park.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late to start rebuilding now. If you exchange items of a similar class at the time of selling yours, there won’t be any major concerns regarding market fluctuations.”</p>
<p>Kayden sat down on the bench, recalling what the branch employee said.</p>
<p>He knew why the vice-captain had directly come and scouted him. Kayden was in the platinum section, and his level was 281 the last time he saw it on the status window before it disappeared. The fucking disclosure of the ranking said he was in 83,626th place out of 182,329 Awakened.</p>
<p>Imir, who held a rank of ten thousand, directly came to see Kayden, who was ranked at eighty thousand, because of Kayden’s trait, ‘Forerunner.’ Thus, it was appropriate for him to focus on rebuilding with items that would help that trait.</p>
<p>The trading platform was not hard to handle, yet that was a problem. There were items he wanted to buy but he couldn’t. If he had lots of money, he wanted to fill up his set with eight A-class items, but he couldn’t even afford to buy one A-class item.</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent was over, but nothing had changed. Those named after gods were still exclusive to the leadership. The only difference was that the price was converted into numbers here when it had been mana stones in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>They would be exchanged only between them as each was worth over a billion dollars. Another difference from the stage was that the exchange revealed what formidable abilities were in those items.</p>
<p>「Name: The God of Wind’s Protective Ring</p>
<p>Category: Item</p>
<p>Class: A</p>
<p>Selling price: $ 210,000,000</p>
<p>Seller: Iljoo OA Co., Ltd」</p>
<p>「Product information: Contains 5000 Physical Defense and 10000 Magic Defense. There is no improvement in the basic ability, but if the user activates ‘Blessing of the God of Wind’ at the same time, the user’s ability surpasses its original state. ‘Blessing of the God of the Wind’ significantly heals injuries and negative impacts from opponent's attacks, and significantly increases the resistance to any negative effects. In addition, the regeneration speed significantly increases in proportion to the Health of the user. 」</p>
<p>The significant increase in resistance to negative effects included toxicity and plague, as well as damage caused by an opponent Awakened’s attack. Merely checking the item details made him comprehend the magnitude of power it would bestow, and his mind began to conjure up vivid scenarios.</p>
<p>What would I be afraid of if I fought under the protection of the Blessing of the God of Wind? Monsters and other Awakened would become nothing to me.</p>
<p>Kayden now realized that people in leadership were equipped with such formidable items.</p>
<p>「Special note: Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s item」</p>
<p>The reason why the market price, which used to fluctuate around one hundred fifty million dollars range, rose more than two hundred million was because of the value in Caliber’s name. Caliber was one of the top leaders.</p>
<p>I should buy this…</p>
<p>If Kayden had that kind of money in his hand, then he would have purchased it immediately. He lost track of time while looking at A-class items for a while, so it was already 8 PM.</p>
<p>Pie in the sky… He stopped rolling while looking at the pie in the sky and started disposing of the lowest-class items in his pockets. After getting rid of the B-class accessory he received as an advance payment, he filled his list with Sense-related items.</p>
<p>He wasn’t restricted to acquiring items solely from the Stage of Advent as the spoils obtained by those venturing into outer space provided comparable benefits. For instance, a ring from the Xyliver kingdom guaranteed increasing one’s Sense. Although it didn’t create a protective barrier, it was not bad due to its cost-effectiveness.</p>
<p>It was almost 10 PM.</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>「 Announcement: The auction of ‘Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider Egg’ has begun.」</p>

<p>「Special note: The user can check the content only if they ‘open’ with an unopened item.」</p>
<p>“...S-class?” he gasped.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:01 ― $ 1,100,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:01 ― $ 1,150,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:01 ― $ 1,155,000,000」</p>
<p>“Who are the people who can afford this…”</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:01 ― $ 1,500,000,000」</p>
<p>He was envious for just a second. Kayden could finally start enjoying the moment after he admitted that he would never be able to access the item. A battle between huge amounts of money was happening right in front of his eyes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I remembered.</p>
<p>During the fall of 2014, when I came out of the dungeon with Yeon-Hee, I received news that made no sense. A fierce bidding war between Daehyun Motor Group and Ilsung Group ensued over a small KEPCO[1] site situated in Samseon-dong, with Daehyun Motor Group offering a whopping 10.55 trillion won for the land alone.</p>
<p>Putting KEPCO’s stake structure together, it basically meant transferring capital from my right pocket to my left pocket. Nevertheless, what was astounding at the time was their willingness to invest such a colossal amount solely into one piece of land.</p>
<p>Jamie claimed that it was necessary to move Daehyun Motor Group’s money accumulated in their warehouse to resolve KEPCO’s deficit. She said it was a beneficial choice for both as KEPCO could resolve their problem and Daehyun could resolve the Oner family’s desire to possess a small company.</p>
<p>Jamie had a deep understanding of the Korean conglomerates family. Of course, this was with the help of the Finance President Park Choong-Sik.</p>
<p>Of course, I understood their position. In order to effectively manage Korea’s business conglomerates, they needed to not only exercise persuasive language but also coddle them like infants.</p>
<p>Daehyun had no choice but to guarantee the Oner family’s influence to a certain extent. If they were to expel the Oner family from the conglomerate group and appoint employed CEOs in their stead, the truth about Jeonil Group would be exposed to the public.</p>
<p>The interests of the Jeonil Group and Oner family were like that. The Oner family had forgotten that they were no different from the employees they looked down on as Jeonil Group didn’t intervene much. That was the story behind as to why Daehyun Motor bid for KEPCO’s small land with ten trillion won.</p>
<p>Ten trillion…</p>
<p>It wasn’t the Oner family’s money as it belonged to a new identity, called ‘Daehyun Motor.’</p>
<p>In addition, the intelligent elites said the interests between the company and family were the common asset of all who are related to their relations, unlike the reality.</p>
<p>However, all of the money was mine.</p>
<p>The reason why I remembered this incident was that it was ambiguous as to whom I was fighting with. I wondered if I was going against my other pocket like when Daehyun Motor and Ilsung were fighting over the KEPCO land.</p>
<p>Of course, that wasn’t always the case. The money might have come from a dictator’s slush funds, the dollars amassed by a wealthy individual at the start of their success, or the illicit funds of a criminal organization. It could have also been the stake released to prevent a market collapse by another group that had secured some form of defensive rights.</p>
<p>That was why it was unnecessary for me to check out the guys who participated in the bidding.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:03 ― $ 1,560,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:03 ― $ 1,600,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:03 ― $ 1,610,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:03 ― $ 1,640,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:03 ― $ 1,650,000,000」</p>
<p>Shortly after, Lee Tae-Han replied to my message.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:06 ― $ 1,830,000,000」</p>
<p>He mentioned thirteen names, including companies and Awakened who had enjoyed wealth even before the Stage of Advent. However, he paused for a few seconds before mentioning the fourteenth company name. Lee Tae-Han sounded surprised.</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: I think it’s from JMC (Jonathan Military Company). The King of Hell’s side. What should I do?&gt;</p>
<p>Jonathan? I had never heard of him establishing a military corporation. Still, it didn’t take long for me to make a decision.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Tell him not to bid.&gt;</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like a bad idea to give my returning comrade Xi Wangmu’s Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider. I would just have to search for another option for my new vehicle.</p>
<p>Around that time, I took my hands off the keyboard.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:06 ― $ 1,850,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:06 ― $ 1,850,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:06 ― $ 1,852,000,000」</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 12:06 ― $ 1,856,000,000」</p>
<p>The opportune moment for me to reemerge would be when only one person remained after the rest had given up.</p>
<p>1. Korea Electric Power Corporation. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 383</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 14:41 ― $ 2,600,000,000」</p>
<p>Tik.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 14:48 ― $ 2,900,000,000」</p>
<p>An additional three hundred million dollars had been added, and there was the possibility of reaching three billion dollars on the horizon.</p>
<p>Kubera grinned, realizing that had he persisted in his desire to venture into outer space, he would have died in the tragic fire that claimed the lives of his Awakened relatives at the Dukedom just a month ago. Then, he would have missed out on the opportunity to take part in this auction.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he was in Korea. As long as the location tracker was inserted under the skin, it was impossible for him to directly contact Odin’s family. As an alternative, he decided to approach the closest individuals of Odin’s father ‘Na Jeon-Il’ and confirm his family tree. It was quite easy.</p>
<p>Na Jeon-Il cherished his son. He didn’t spare time to boast about his son, and interestingly, Odin had become a famous analyst at Jonathan Investment Finance Group. Kubera couldn’t believe that he was under the title ‘analyst,’ when he ruled the entire world.</p>
<p>After months of hovering around them, Kubera realized that the Na Jeon-Il couple was indeed Odin’s kryptonite[1]. Ever since Odin departed from the Stage of Advent, he had been taking care of his parents. He tried not to reveal his shocking identity to them. Instead, he had hired high-level Awakened to guard them and called them regularly. To his parents, Odin was not the ruler of the world, but instead an only, beloved child.</p>
<p>It was an unbelievable result, but there was clear evidence. Odin, the demonic king, was an incredibly nice and caring son to his parents!</p>
<p>Tick.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 14:48 ― $ 3,000,000,000」</p>
<p>Kubera bid on the auction and then looked over some profile documents. These documents contained information on people who could be used to lure Odin’s parents to a specific location to be taken hostage. Among the people listed were one of Na Jeon-Il’s subordinates and some of their old friends.</p>
<p>To the couple, Kubera was known simply as a foreign investor who was looking for a retired individual from the Jeonil Group who had strong influence. Kubera chose a few of them and winked at his subordinates to further deepen their relationships with the chosen figures. He also meant to identify those who would be easily manipulated by money and those who wouldn’t, and secure more of their weaknesses.</p>
<p>Since Kubera had formed the group with the Awakened who were once part of his group during the Stage of Advent, there was no need for much explanation. However, it was crucial that Kubera’s men were unaware of the identity of the Na Jeon-Il couple as the entire plan could be easily jeopardized.</p>
<p>At that time, Kubera received a message from the family through an encrypted channel.</p>
<p>&lt;D: If you are participating in the auction, stop it.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;C: What is the problem? The item is priceless. Just put more money in there. If our current plan succeeds, then the amount of money going in would be insignificant.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;D: Think about why Odin left the trading system open. You can’t compete with him.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;C: Did Odin join the auction?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;D: I’m just saying we should assume that he did. If that’s the case, you shouldn’t provoke him by raising the price. Just stay quiet. As you said, if the plan works out, this will be nothing.&gt;</p>
<p>“...Shit.”</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 14:48 ― $ 3,000,000,000」</p>
<p>Kubera glared at the amount he bid on the monitor and tasted bitterness in his mouth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As soon as it hit exactly three billion dollars, Lille was in agony. There were no issues with regards to pursuing business in outer space, as the business agenda for it was already approved at the general shareholders’ meeting. The main concern was whether they would approve of the allocation of more than three billion dollars from company funds towards one single item.</p>
<p>She could easily tolerate any negative judgment from individual investors. In fact, she was ready to be responsible for all the disappointments due to their concerns of the company’s finances.</p>
<p>However, if powerful shareholders such as Jonathan Investment Finance Group, Gillian Investment Finance Group, and multinational investment firms based in tax havens disapproved of her decision to use that much money, then she couldn’t guarantee her chance of being reappointed for the next term.</p>
<p>Lille looked at a person among the executives. He was an Awakened, ranked 430th in the world. He used the code name ‘Skanda,’ the god of war in Indian mythology. He was dressed like other executives in a suit, but he caught everyone’s attention with a huge sword strapped to his back. It emitted a bright glow, overshadowing the conference room’s lighting.</p>
<p>His sword was also classified as an S-class item. She wondered how many individuals would possess an item valued at an astronomical amount of three billion dollars, purchased with their personal funds rather than their company’s.</p>
<p>Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider Egg had reached three billion dollars just because it was an S-class even though no one had confirmed its identity. Therefore, it was safe to say that this guy’s sword had more value than that.</p>
<p>However, he still had a poker face on. Although he had become a billionaire at once, he was only looking at the auction window on the large screen.</p>
<p>Lille thought that these items were generally overpriced. They generated supernatural abilities in Awakened hands, but they were just pieces of scrap metal in the hands of ordinary civilians.</p>
<p>Ironically, this was precisely why she needed to swiftly venture into outer space. There were forces leading the price increase, and they were creating the item market, the major sources of profit in outer space.</p>
<p>But three billion dollars is too much…</p>
<p>The company’s nested structure was this: the Jonathan Group held twenty one percent, the Gillian Group had fourteen percent, other holding companies had thirteen percent, the private equity funds held twelve percent, the individual investors held seven percent, their start-up partners had two percent, and the remaining thirty-one percent was distributed between tax havens-based multinational investment companies.</p>
<p>Most of them had a strong influence on the management of the company.</p>
<p>“We will put four billion dollars as the maximum limit.”</p>
<p>The company had already ventured enough, and they had shown the efforts to Skanda. After making that declaration, Lille examined Skanda’s response. Fortunately, he kept his position without saying much as if he understood the company’s position.</p>
<p>The executives also mentioned that it would be wise to bow out if the price exceeded four billion dollars. This was because even if the last bid was unsuccessful, there were funds available to shift toward Chinese investment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Chinese market was fully opened up, and a whole new world had unfolded for entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, merciless bandits such as the Jonathan and Gillian Group were fixated on obtaining lucrative deals at a low cost under the guise of investment.</p>
<p>The government had also been pressuring local companies to accept significant amounts of foreign investment. This had turned China into a profitable haven for foreigners, leading some to speculate that the detention of low-level Awakened by the authorities had contributed to the ongoing crisis. However, these were just the reasons cited by Western capitalists.</p>
<p>Li Zhiheng was certain about that as there was clear evidence of this happening. By simply deploying the IMF and gradually increasing the level of exploitation, they seemed to have already finalized their plan to subject China to their whims.</p>
<p>China had been subjected to numerous attacks on all fronts. Foreign capitalists sliced private companies that had relocated to Hong Kong, privatized China’s municipal enterprises and boiled them in hot water, and sold off the land originally owned by the Chinese government at a bargain price to grill them.</p>
<p>In addition, the leader, who was supposed to prioritize domestic affairs, seemed more invested in recovering slush funds and exposing corruption within the former regime. This preoccupation led to a constant military presence around the clock. Basically, China was a mess.</p>
<p>In the meantime, one S-class item was worth three billion dollars? Li Zhiheng thought it was unacceptable.</p>
<p>He complained, “With this kind of money, you can live either here or in the United States like royalty. We don’t lack anything.”</p>
<p>His son retorted, “It’s not that we will actually become royalty if we did that. Please make the bid, Father.”</p>
<p>“You only call me ‘Father’ when you want something from me,” Li Zhi-Heng accused.</p>
<p>“You will regret it if you miss it.”</p>
<p>“Do you even know what that is?” he asked incredulously.</p>
<p>His son rolled his eyes. “There is nothing to argue about an S-class item. Are you short of money?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Li Zhiheng picked up the phone and instructed his subordinate to transfer more money into his account. The moment he touched the keyboard…</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 14:52 ― $ 3,300,000,000」</p>
<p>Under the name of his son, Li Zhi-Heng’s bid went up to the top. He believed that he had to please the plunderers to recover the costs that would be incurred. Also, he saw himself as a weapon for foreign capital, committed to inflicting more harm on China, so that they would swallow the pieces of China without any problem.</p>
<p>“Watch carefully and learn what true wealth is.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even the Rothchild’s RMC had given up at this point. Even the CVA, which was the most enthusiastic about entering outer space, surrendered once the price reached three billion dollars. An Awakened, who had already been rich even before awakening, also gave up bidding at that point.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they lacked the funds, but they arrived at a practical and unsentimental decision that it would be illogical to buy a solitary S-class item for over three billion dollars. The existing capital forces that were inflating the item market also thought that was enough. They were probably cheering at this time.</p>
<p>Therefore, the last two remaining bidders were a military company based in a European distribution company and an individual Awakened believed to be related to a Chinese capital. Among them, the last winner was the Chinese Awakened named Li Youkang.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:50 ― $ 4,000,000,000」</p>
<p>No one made bids for thirty minutes after the price reached four billion dollars. Li Youkang held a rank of 162,329 among the Awakened, so he was in the gold section. He seemed to be channeling his regrets that hadn’t been resolved in the Stage of Advent by doing this.</p>
<p>Furthermore, I had a hunch that the money was coming from his father, Li Zhiheng. Similar to what had happened during Korea’s IMF crisis, numerous individuals in China were currently exploiting the national crisis for their personal gains.</p>
<p>Anyway, there was nothing for me to be afraid of as this money wasn’t coming directly from my pockets.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:51 ― $ 4,100,000,000」</p>
<p>I added one hundred million dollars.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:51 ― $ 4,200,000,000」</p>
<p>Then, he responded in the same way.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:51 ― $ 5,000,000,000」</p>
<p>He became quiet when I changed the first number of the amount.</p>
<p>A few minutes later…</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:54 ― $ 6,000,000,000」</p>
<p>I could feel that Li Zhiheng had done a great job in harming his country when he added that much more money. With that amount, he could build a huge business on the mainland instead of entering outer space. Alternatively, he could earn above-average profits by directly investing in stocks that were steadily rising or leaving them to my investment group.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Li Zhiheng and his son were only bidding so frantically because it was an S-class item.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee pretended to cut her throat, so I accepted their challenge.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:54 ― $ 10,000,000,000」</p>
<p>I felt like I had forgotten the taste of spending money. This kind of amount wasn’t even noticeable compared to the total capital I owned, but it was devastating to the public. To be honest, if it hadn’t been Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider Egg, then I wouldn’t have come this far either.</p>
<p>I never thought Li Zhiheng and his son would be able to catch up, but they appeared disheveled and surprisingly managed to do so.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:55 ― $ 10,001,392,000」</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee whistled as if she was impressed by their action. I bid with one more dollar.</p>
<p>「 7.11 / 15:55 ― $ 10,001,392,001」</p>
<p>However, the number on the monitor remained unchanged even after the last bid opportunity passed. That was the maximum amount that Li Zhiheng and his son could bid by scraping up every single penny that they had. It was surprising that they could manage that much with personal cash, not company money.</p>
<p>It was not long after the final approval was dropped from the trading platform.</p>
<p>「Winning bid: 10,001,392,001」</p>
<p>As soon as the first S-class item auction ended, news articles poured out into the media.</p>
<p>「Breaking News: ‘Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider Egg’ Finally Sold for Over Ten Billion Dollars!」</p>
<p>「Breaking News: An S-class Item ‘Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider Egg.’ Sold More Than Sixty-Six Times the Average Price of an A-class Item Amid Fierce Competition.」</p>
<p>「Breaking News: A Single Item Worth Ten Billion?! ‘Astonished.’」</p>
<p>「Breaking News: Hidden Capital’s Collision, Stage was I-Trade.」</p>
<p>I pushed the laptop aside and picked up the phone.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Gillian.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Are you in Beijing?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: There must be an official named Li Zhiheng. Do you know him? He has over ten billion dollars in personal cash alone, but I have never heard of him before.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: He is barely managing his position in the government.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: What kind of connection does he have with us?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: He is responsible for handling some of the express land-related issues.&gt;</p>
<p>I asked because I wondered if he was in charge of the slush fund the Chinese leader was supposed to pay me back with. Li Zhiheng’s appearance didn’t come as a surprise to me. Even if he had pocketed ten billion dollars, he would have willingly surrendered hundreds of times more Chinese assets to us.</p>
<p>There were multiple people like them, so it wasn’t worth it for me to remember each of their names.</p>
<p>1. To be someone’s ‘kryptonite’ means to have power or influence over that person, making them weak or vulnerable, often used to describe a strong emotional or psychological impact on someone. ☜</p>

<p>‘Baek Seong-In’s Breaking Through News’</p>
<p>■ Channel: FM 99.1 (18:10 ~ 20:00)</p>
<p>■ Date: July 12th, 2018 (Thursday)</p>
<p>■ Guest: Lee Soo-Il, Professor at Seongju University</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In (host, commentator, news reader)&gt; Today, we will discuss the overall problems, starting with the item trading market. Professor Lee Soo-Il at Seongju University is on the connection. Good evening, Professor.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Hello.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; The very first S-class auction was held yesterday, and Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider Egg was sold at an astronomical winning bid of over ten billion dollars. I can’t even imagine how large ten billion dollars is!</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; That is true. The exchange rate was 1056.30 won yesterday, so that’s equivalent to ten trillion, fifty-six billion Korean won. Let’s use the stock market as an example. The total market value of Daehyun Motor is thirty trillion won, so ten trillion could buy thirty percent of the stocks of Daehyun Motor.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Wow.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Everyone here likes smartphones, right? The most expensive one among Berry’s A phone costs 1.5 million won including VAT, so with ten trillion won we could provide them to 6.66 million people for free. Also, we could even pay the tuition for every single college student in Korea for one term with ten trillion won.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; That is unbelievable, but there have been two more S-class item auctions since then. The second one was sold at four billion dollars, which was forty percent of the initial winning price, and the third one was sold at three billion dollars. It is understandable that the first transaction was bound to be fierce, but three billion dollars is indeed an astronomical amount as well.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; When considering the entirety of the situation, there is so much to discuss. Yet, upon closer examination, it becomes apparent that it is merely a fragment of the actual economy, which operates on the principle that as demand increases and supply decreases, prices rise.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Yeah, I agree.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Also, the Awakened hold a position that dictates the crucial factors of profitability and risk in outer space exploration. In order to secure the allegiance of the Awakened, corporations are obliged to make significant investments in costly, top-of-the-line items. As a result, these often carry an astronomical price tag, as you mentioned.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; What is your opinion on the current market price?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; According to the association’s announcement, less than ten percent of the two hundred thousand Awakened have entered outer space. There are many reasons for this. First of all, the association has yet to completely open the entranceway to outer space, which they call the ‘dungeon.’ Also, agencies and companies are presently deliberating the advantages and gains of venturing into the extraterrestrial realm.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Ah, I see.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Since a new source of revenue, the item market, has been guaranteed, more companies will be willing to enter and invest in outer space entry.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; That makes sense.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; The World Awakened Association is actively supporting companies’ entry into outer space. In other words, the number of their entries will definitely impact the price trend of the items.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Do you think the value of items is as the association expected?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Yes. Undeniably, the supernatural products referred to as items have never before been traded in human history, and the market, with a modest consumer base of merely two hundred thousand individuals, is bewildering. However, it’s a different story if you look at them as military weapons. That is probably the right way to look at this situation.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; …</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; With so many supernatural happenings going on in different parts of outer space, it’s becoming more evident that humans will use the land separately from profits.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Are you talking about the war industry of our world?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; The association has limited the war industry of Awakened to outer space, and the majority of them appear to be willing to follow their instruction. Not long ago, the Safety Bureau subdued any unregistered Awakened who had appeared during the Yemen Civil War. Both government forces and their enemies who employed them are vigorously urging for their extradition, which is anticipated to take place sooner or later.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; So I think the association should implement a stricter policy in managing items. Imagine unregistered Awakened holding onto high-level items. Simultaneously, it is important for both the global community and the world at large to cooperate extensively in order for secure nations to swiftly capture or eradicate unregistered Awakened individuals.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; What kind of cooperation are you talking about?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; There are damages that inevitably occur when the Security Bureau takes action. Let’s look at our country. Everyone probably remembers the disturbance that Awakened caused at an Incheon hostess bar last month. To be exact, it was supposed to be called ‘An Unregistered Awakened’s Rampage.’</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; That was the first Awakened incident in Korea. Since then there has been no issue here compared to other countries, but it was shocking.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Before diving into the details, we should be familiar with the power structure at the Stage of Advent’s Final Stage. The Awakened in Korea is largely divided into two forces.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; I heard they were the Savior Odin’s group and Mary’s group, right?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; That’s correct. The Korean Awakened in Revolucion (12) during the Final Stage are categorized as members of Odin’s group, while those associated with Revolucion (42) are regarded as part of Mary’s faction. The hostess bar rampage was caused by an Awakened in Revolucion (42).</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Oh, I see.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; The members of Odin’s faction call themselves the ‘Savior’s people’ and are loyal to Odin regardless of their nationality. Therefore, they faithfully followed Odin’s instructions not to cause social unrest.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; But I heard that all the Awakened were in awe of Odin.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; You can never know what a person really thinks. I assume this particular guy must have had discontentment towards the microchip implantation and opposition towards the association’s overall policies. Anyway, the Incheon hostess bar incident occurred when the unregistered Awakened tried to take control of Incheon’s violent gang. In addition to the gang that owned the bar, nearby businesses were negatively impacted by this. Remember how the business owners reacted back then.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; The government promised to compensate for the damage, but business owners flocked to the association headquarters’ Korean branch and made a fuss. They surely knew they had entered into an area of extraterritorial jurisdiction under the UN agreement.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Ah…</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Also, what was the point of wearing alien monster masks? I understand they tried to make their voice heard, but if they were going to protest in a mask, they should have at least complied with the Assembly Demonstration Act outside the border. But what happened? There were physical collisions when they tried to get inside the perimeter.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; The business owners contended that they found it hard to believe the government’s assessment of the extent of the damage, and that the suppression of the Awakened by the Safety Bureau further exacerbated the damages. These two were their main arguments, and their points had drawn sympathy from the public. More than four hundred thousand citizens signed the petition because of the association’s judicial system.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Prior to that, people might have perceived the agreement between the World Awakened Association and UN member states as insincere, but it was only after witnessing businessmen being forcefully suppressed and taken into detention centers that they likely realized the gravity of the situation. At least in Korea, the public had viewed the association and the Awakened as a simple media creation. At least, that’s how they viewed them before.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Are you suggesting that the businessmen were aware of the special circumstances regarding the land they were attempting to enter, but lacked sufficient knowledge about the specifics?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; One S-class item that was auctioned for the first time was sold at ten billion dollars. Not that many people can imagine the magnitude of the amount. My summary is that the public thinks that Korea’s agreement with the World Awakened Association as a member of the United Nations is very unfair, but they should understand why UN members had no choice but to sign such an agreement with the association. If they did understand, then would they have tried to enter the land of the association branch wearing the masks of alien monsters?</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; People released from custody are preparing a lawsuit against the government and the World Awakened Association. What is your thought on this?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; You should know that this is a lawsuit that cannot be validated in the first place. The government is actually being very considerate of the businessmen by not dealing with the damage done by them as the law of war. That’s what I want to reiterate.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; …</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; I mentioned that not only the world community but also the entire world should cooperate greatly with the association. It’s also because in addition to the problem that unregistered Awakened cause, the war of humanity is still taking place. When Korea had an uproar with one unregistered Awakened, North America and Europe had multiple alien raids.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; I don’t know if I should call them ‘bases,’ but four Awakened and civilian military companies’ bases were attacked.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; It is difficult to check the reality unless we are directly involved in the matter. We should admit that. Even though the businessmen didn’t have positive images in society, many people sympathized with them because they realized that the association started to have a direct impact on their lives.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; I see.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; For example, if I open the window from my apartment, I can see a hill. It’s called Choo Il Bong, and the residents of our apartment used it as a hiking trail. Now it has become a controlled area affected by the agreement. Whether intentionally or not, the media has formed an image that anyone entering the control area would be in the same situation with the businessmen. Aren’t there people around you like that?</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Yes.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; People weren’t interested in the Yemen Civil War before, but they started looking into it because they feel like the refugees will come to Korea and cause problems. Still, a war in the far Arab states doesn’t feel real. I’m just saying that we should admit the general public’s psychology and face it. However, it’s very dangerous to treat extraterrestrial attacks in North America and Europe as they are. It’s something that can happen to us at any time as we are exposed to a controlled area near us.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; There is a good example of that. The World Awakened Association headquarters is in Korea, and there was actually one invasion.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Exactly.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Last but not least, what do you think about the association’s general direction of entry? In addition to the Awakened and regular military personnel, there are suggestions to establish a coalition with a focus on major countries.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; The actions that the association has shown so far have come down to one thing.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; What is it?</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; The association doesn’t want humanity to go through another war. I’d like to ask those of you who want to form a coalition. Do you want your sons to carry guns and fight a war somewhere in outer space?</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; All right, Professor. That’s all the questions I have for today.</p>
<p>◆ Lee Soo-Il&gt; Thank you for inviting me.</p>
<p>◇ Baek Seong-In&gt; Thank you for coming.</p>

<p>└ Jackpot: But four hundred thousand people signed the petition lol.</p>
<p>└ I’m Odin: I admit your guts, unregistered Awakened. But that’s it. As long as I, Odin, am watching you, you are dead. You should feel the bitterness from the Final Stage more. Stay quiet. I’ll be standing behind your backs as soon as I smell your breath. Hoo hoo hoo. Summon the gate!</p>
<p>└ White: You idiots are unbelievable. Be careful, man. The real Odin will come get you.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The web page converted the interview conversation into a text form.</p>
<p>The association doesn’t want humanity to go through a war.</p>
<p>The controversialist who came out as a guest had grasped my exact intention. It was unreasonable to say that Jamie’s influence had reached this small broadcast, so the overall public opinion wasn’t necessarily negative toward the association. There were people who understood us.</p>
<p>At that time, Yeon-Hee was petting Kciphos with one hand and eating ice cream with the other. She was killing time by surfing the Internet for the first time in a while and smiled as she glanced at me.</p>
<p>She said she felt like we were in a relationship as I wasn’t working too much. As the comments conveyed a message of peace, my world was progressing seamlessly from a trading system to an entire financial empire. Therefore, I was taking a break until the items I ordered arrived.</p>
<p>One of the Savior’s people left to receive the insignia and the Spider Egg.</p>
<p>Then, Yeon-Hee asked, “Has Jonathan contacted you?”</p>
<p>Jonathan hadn’t set up a military company and participated in the bidding. Instead, it was Olivia, a close aide to him. Jonathan only instructed her to do so and didn’t tell her about his whereabouts. He had been like that ever since he appeared at the rituals of the four priests.</p>
<p>I thought he was wandering, but Yeon-Hee seemed to have a different thought. She believed he was moving secretly for a purpose he didn’t tell me, but Jonathan wouldn’t have been doing that. Yeon-Hee’s opinion remained unchanged even when she brought up Jessica. She said the Stage of Advent was a place that would turn a person into a completely different individual.</p>
<p>Did the Stage of Advent change Jonathan? No, he was a man of unwavering loyalty to his people, having stood firm in his convictions during the tumultuous times of the past. This was precisely why I selected him as my partner. If there were any chance that his character could have been altered during the Stage of Advent, then he would have already shifted his attitude upon the accumulation of immense wealth before him.</p>
<p>However, he never changed and didn’t even claim his due share. Jonathan was such a man.</p>
<p>“I don’t believe in anyone except you. People think and move according to a given environment. It’s called role-playing. It’s not the people who change; it’s the surroundings that change.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said that and didn’t even listen to my answer. Instead, she went into a separate room as she wanted to avoid further arguments.</p>
<p>There was one thing Jonathan told me before the return.</p>
<p>“But we should remove those we shouldn’t take. I have a few guys on my mind.”</p>
<p>Even after returning, he often mentioned that he was chasing those whom he wasn’t able to deal with in the Final Stage. I knew whom he was talking about. Those who shared the same blood as the Rothschilds, Goldsteins, Morgans, Medicis, and other club members. They were the members of the royal family of an oil-producing country that didn’t belong to the club but had an immense impact.</p>
<p>Besides them, anyone born with blood that could affect the internal affairs of the club could be included in the ‘removal targets’ that Jonathan mentioned.</p>
<p>However, there was a reason why I thought he was wandering. If he were killing the targets, then he wouldn’t have cut off contact. Therefore, I thought he was debating whether to return to Jonathan Hunter, the financier, or remain as the King of Hell.</p>
<p>I decided to respect his decision no matter which one he chose. I planned to gift him Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider if he returned as the King of Hell, but delegate the club’s throne if he returned as Jonathan Hunter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>&lt;Olivia: Odin is looking for you.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: I feel bad for him.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Olivia: Why don’t you contact Mary instead?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Mary doesn’t understand the internal affairs of the club and him, so she won’t agree with me. Also, Mary is excluded because Kubera and the other mental healers could get pissed and attack her.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Olivia: Okay.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Remember, Olivia. Kubera himself is not a problem, but the real issue will occur when Odin realizes that this guy targeted his parents. He is already burdened with a great deal of issues, so I have no desire to make him worry about this nonsense.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Olivia: I understand what you mean.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Yes. It’s a burden that no one can carry for him…&gt;</p>
<p>1. a premium credit card offered to high net-worth individuals who meet certain income and credit score requirements. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 385</p>
<p>There was a time in Korea when society was noisy due to an agreement between the World Awakened Association and UN member states. The Korean citizens had been raving about the government bringing the sanctuary of extraterritoriality into the country regardless of their will.</p>
<p>However, Jonathan thought differently. From his perspective, the sanctuary in Korea was the residential complex ‘Apgujeong Jeonil Nobles Park’ because the former and current executives of the Jeonil Group were concentrated there.</p>
<p>To reside in the complex, individuals had to undergo a qualification screening process where only their family background and societal status were taken into account. A discerning interviewer, stationed at one end of the management office within the complex, conveyed the impression that only individuals belonging to the upper echelons of Korean Society would be considered.</p>
<p>Therefore, they solely approved applications from individuals with political or business affiliations, as well as high-ranking public officials.</p>
<p>Judging the residents? It was the hotbed of class racism.</p>
<p>In addition, outsiders had to carry their ID cards and go through procedures to get into the complex, and it was no exception to even the residents’ guests. They had no choice but to waste so much time at the entrance, and being a prosecutor or police investigator was not an exception.</p>
<p>As such, Nobles Park was built in a structure that controlled and quarantined outsiders. Jonathan looked down from the roof of the tower and thought he wanted to bring this structure to tax avoidance factories in New York and Panama. If Odin wanted to avoid oppressing the people with military force, then he had to be cautious of the direction in which the wind was blowing.</p>
<p>For instance, the results of the presidential elections in Korea and the United States were different from what the club had anticipated. As a result, if the general public found out that the Day of Advent, the financial conflicts with China, and space exploration to be unremarkable subjects, they may end up turning their attention to examining the vast riches of the financial empires.</p>
<p>Such a movement had started all over the world. Then, the government would be compelled to pretend, with some officials possibly exhibiting genuine concern rather than just putting up a facade. Moral dilemmas could arise, and certain individuals might exploit the situation for personal gain and use it as a springboard to advance their own interests.</p>
<p>There was a high chance that those who didn’t know the existence of the club would move more aggressively. If they showed up at the imperial complex with search warrants, then the security procedures in Apgujeong Jeonil Nobles Park was the perfect way to buy time as they would waste a lot of time here at the entrance.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he could destroy data or evacuate employees who were closely involved in the defense of the Day of Advent. That was probably why Jamie had designed the place like this.</p>
<p>Jonathan muttered, “It’s not bad.”</p>
<p>He was beginning to like Jamie’s work.</p>
<p>She has become…more like a member of the club.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been interested in her before, but this way, she might have understood the direction in which Odin wanted to rule the world. That explained why he appointed her, a mere figurehead, as a member of the club.</p>
<p>As soon as he realized that he wanted to talk with her in person after completing this task, the light was turned off on the floor where Odin’s parents lived. The Korean drama they enjoyed watching usually ended around this time.</p>
<p>11 PM. Jonathan shifted his gaze further up from there. There was only one room on each floor, so the closest place to them were the floors above and below them.</p>
<p>Jonathan’s Sense easily picked out the Savior’s people, who were fully armed with A-class items. However, he had no intention of letting them know that Sun’s parents were being targeted as his job was to erase the fact that it had ever happened.</p>
<p>It was D-Day. Jonathan took out the returning stone.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dresner Rothschild regained consciousness after fainting from pain. He let out a scream, but it was abruptly muffled by a large hand that covered his mouth and nose, causing Dresner to briefly experience what it felt like to suffocate.</p>
<p>Although his eyes were uncovered, his vision didn’t return. Only a dark red light pulsed as an increasing pain spread through him. He felt like he was going to be out of breath. He heard a sound coming from a distant nightmare.</p>
<p>“Stay quiet. Then, I will let you breathe.”</p>
<p>Dresner managed to stop struggling. When he was able to breathe again, some of the teeth that were rolling in his mouth touched his throat. When he coughed out the blood and teeth, Dresner could see a face close to him. Only then did he realize that his vision had returned.</p>
<p>At first, his vision was still murky, preventing him from seeing the face clearly. He could barely discern that the person was muscular, and only their merciless eyes appeared to be hovering in the air.</p>
<p>Dresner’s heart pounded faster and he realized something.</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>It was around the time of this year’s club meeting. It was an important conference as it was the first meeting they had since the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>Despite his desire to attend, he had been forced to delegate someone else to represent him due to the intrusion of someone with these merciless eyes into his bedroom. Dresner had a hunch that the same guy had come again to enact something violent this time!</p>
<p>“Dresner Rothschild.”</p>
<p>The perpetrator called him again.</p>
<p>“Dresner Rothschild.”</p>
<p>Dresner felt a sense of unease that sent shivers down his spine from the man’s calm voice. He knew all too well that this was the most dangerous situation.</p>
<p>Due to his broken teeth, the blood mixed in his saliva, and the excruciating pain from his cheekbones to his lower jaw, it took a considerable amount of time for his vision to fully recover.</p>
<p>Probably because he had never been so helplessly exposed to such violence, Dresner was focused on the sour taste of blood and severe pain. He couldn’t remember what he had been doing before encountering this guy. He forgot if he had been sleeping or working.</p>
<p>All that was clear was that he was lying on the floor and being threatened by a mysterious man. He blinked multiple times on purpose, and it helped him to see the man’s face more clearly. When he finally recognized him, Dresner had a wake-up call in his head!</p>
<p>Jonathan!</p>
<p>Then, a stack of papers was hurled in Dresner’s direction, hitting him in the face and causing the papers to scatter about. When the papers struck his mouth, blood immediately flowed.</p>
<p>Whenever he breathed heavily as if he was shrieking, the last piece of paper that remained on his face was fluttering without falling off. In the parts where blood hadn’t soaked in, the word GOLD was as clear as day. These documents were supposed to be in a safe as weapons to attack Odin one day.</p>
<p>Dresner quickly took the paper off his face and checked the face.</p>
<p>“...Do you want gold?”</p>
<p>The name Jonathan kept spinning in his head.</p>
<p>“I’m asking if you want gold, Jonathan.”</p>
<p>His pronunciation wasn’t clear because of his missing and broken teeth. Jonathan didn’t reply. Every time Jonathan clenched and opened his fist, embers blazed in his hands. It looked like he was practicing the movements to murder Dresner.</p>
<p>Dresner already knew that this was a life-threatening situation. The quietness outside the hallway made it sound even more like he was in a morgue. The only sound he heard was the door creaking with its hinges twisted.</p>
<p>Dresner said in a hurry, “Odin is strict in the use of force by the Awakened. You are making a big mistake, Jonathan. How dare you come…”</p>
<p>Jonathan interrupted tersely, “I’m here because of Kubera to take out the trash. Is that a good enough reason?”</p>
<p>A painful cough burst out of Dresner’s mouth again. His eyes popped out, and he became speechless as if he was being strangled by a noose.</p>
<p>Kubera, Kubera, Kubera!</p>
<p>Dresner wondered whether it would have been wiser to not have listened to the response. Ever since he heard that name, he had ventured too far to turn back. Similar to Joshua von Karjan, it was rumored that Jonathan Hunter had ruled for many years as a terrifying monarch.</p>
<p>Dresner felt like an intense heat radiating off him when Jonathan sat next to him. Jonathan’s piercing gaze held a simmering anger that seemed to threaten to burst into flames at any moment.</p>
<p>Fear swept through his body, and without giving it much thought, Drenser blurted out a word, fearing that the silence would hasten his death.</p>
<p>“I… I don’t know what you are misunderstanding… but…why do you think the association and club exist? Odin is breaking the rules he wanted to keep himself. Is this really what he wants? Suppressing his assistant by force behind the scenes? Take me to Odin. I want to face him in person and clear up the misunderstanding.”</p>
<p>Jonathan responded coldly, “That’s too bad. He doesn’t know anything, Dresner. I can deal with idiots like you. Get up.”</p>
<p>Dresner slowly raised his upper body as Jonathan gestured for him to get up. As Jonathan also straightened himself up and headed to the desk, Dresner couldn’t help but widen his eyes.</p>
<p>Why have I not seen this until now?</p>
<p>Dresner found an arm drooping under his desk and started trembling in dread. The excruciating torment that the body had endured before succumbing to death was evidenced by the bloodstains left behind. He was Dresner’s closest aide, the butler of the family. Only then did Dresner realize that Jonathan had spent a lot of time in the mansion before waking him up.</p>
<p>Jonathan gestured towards the desk and directed Dresner to take a seat on the chair. Dresner did as he was told.</p>
<p>Multiple contracts were signed on the monitor. Among them, the most noticeable were jobs closely related to non-profit foundations that Dresner established for tax avoidance. Over two days, important family assets were being swept to the foundations. In other words, Dresner had fainted for two days. In the meantime…</p>
<p>The family is breaking apart…</p>
<p>Dresner looked at the butler, who was dead in front of his feet, with resentment. Then, he found his crypto chip plugged into the computer and turned his head toward Jonathan. He wanted to say that this was a robbery.</p>
<p>This was the greatest robbery of all time, but the chilling silence that enveloped the entire mansion kept him quiet. Not only that, whether it was somber madness or a clear belief, but there was also a very determination in Jonathan’s eyes.</p>
<p>Dresner whispered like he was moaning, “Even Odin cannot run the world with only a few aides. What would the other members think of today? If you are going to keep the world under capitalism…”</p>
<p>Jonathan sneered. “You mean we have to give you a chance to explain everything in front of people.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Think again, Dresner. Do you really want to stand in front of Odin? You are not that foolish to be unaware of the opportunity in front of you right now.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Have you ever stepped on a rotten tomato and popped it?” Jonathan asked.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“If Odin realizes what you have done, your family will explode, just like that.”</p>
<p>Dresner’s heart sank.</p>
<p>“The Rothschild family would be better off being remembered in history as a kind-hearted family who donated an incredible sum of money to NGOs. Trust me, Dresner. Rothschild will leave voluntarily before Odin and Mary notice.”</p>
<p>Nothing Jonathan said was wrong. It was impossible to deceive Odin, and Mary was known as one of the most powerful Awakened with mental attributes. He had been proceeding with his plan seamlessly, but he had forgotten one possibility. He never imagined that the King of Hell, Jonathan Hunter, had been watching Odin’s parents since he came back from the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Dresner remembered a former head of the family who had lost his lower body during the subprime. Although he had only lost a part of his body, Dresner had literally put his and his family’s life in flames! Along with the decades he spent being the clown of the club…</p>
<p>Dresner wrapped his hands around his forehead in resignation.</p>
<p>“What is going to happen now…?” he moaned.</p>
<p>Jonathan stated calmly, “I promise that I will let you go without any pain. In order to do that, I will have to finish it while I still have my patience. Start it before it gets too late.”</p>
<p>His voice itself contained enormous power.</p>
<p>Flinch!</p>
<p>Unconsciously, Dresner reached for the mouse, but his trembling hand caused the cursor on the monitor to shake. While organizing the program windows, he found an encrypted chat window. It was a conversation that Jonathan used to lure Kubera into the place by offering to provide A-class items as bait.</p>
<p>Right then Jonathan glanced out of the window and spoke.</p>
<p>“Your friend is here, Dresner, and he’ll be going to hell with you. You won’t be lonely anymore.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 386</p>
<p>「Title: The Rothschild Group’s Bold Move: Launching the Largest Public Utility Foundations Ever Seen!</p>
<p>The Rothschild Group has made a surprise donation of the group’s property to society. They announced that they were deeply impressed by Jonathan Investment Financial Group’s two trillion dollars donation for the world’s peace in April.</p>
<p>Besides their nickname ‘Defender of the Day of Advent,’ the Rothschilds hold a large stake in multinational conglomerate corporations such as Berry, Googol, NanoSoft, and City Group. They have made the largest amount of donations in a short period ever recorded through the group’s public utility foundations…」</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the assets that went into the public foundation meant they had left the family’s pockets. However, the reality was different. As long as the family controlled the foundation’s board of directors, they could exercise the same power over the group.</p>
<p>Especially in the United States and England, where the Rothschild family originated, governments didn’t levy taxes on stock donations made to public foundations. Therefore, there were many cases where companies exploited this.</p>
<p>Therefore, the criteria for determining whether the donation was based on pure good faith or not was clear. It depended on whether the foundation had independence! However, it was surprising to note that the thirteen foundations, which had received the entire assets of the Rothschild family, were operating independently.</p>
<p>None of Dresner’s real blood relatives, so-called the ‘Rothschild family,’ had any power in those foundations. That wasn’t the only point that showed that the foundations hadn’t been created for succession. If they intended to succeed as the successor in their family, then they would have established a new foundation that would fulfill their purpose.</p>
<p>&lt;Kim Cheong-Soo: It seemed to have been prepared steadily since the end of the Stage of Advent. As Dresner said, they might have caused this incident in anticipation of opposition from the family.&gt;</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo said on the video call monitor. He rummaged through the data in a surprised manner as if he couldn’t understand Rothschild’s decision.</p>
<p>It only took two days for the Rothschild family’s entire assets to be split up into thirteen public foundations, but it would have taken months to just figure out the scale of their property. Even if they utilized the electronic legal system of the UK government, the number of pertinent documents would have been significant enough to fill a substantial book.</p>
<p>It was never a task that could be carried out impulsively. Kim Cheong-Soo was unable to locate any data that would arouse suspicion. As he maneuvered his mouse and clicked on the page, the ultimatum sent by Dresner to Kim Cheong-Soo was magnified on a single section of the video conferencing program.</p>
<p>「Since the Day of Advent, I have contemplated lots of things, including whether my decision would create any problems for the club. Nevertheless, after deliberating on the matter, I concluded that I could proceed with this for the sake of peace in humanity, if it could offer you even a small measure of help.</p>
<p>However, the family members will never understand my decision. They will aim their swords at me, but I have no regrets. Please forgive and take care of them.</p>
<p>You will soon find out what decision I made. 」</p>
<p>Dresner was aware that his family members might threaten his life due to his decision. Although his conviction was resolute, it was hard for me to believe that he relinquished his family’s assets to society with purely altruistic intentions.</p>
<p>He volunteered to be a clown while suppressing his anger and thirst for revenge. Even if a person might have the capacity to change at any time, it was implausible for someone like him to single-handedly execute a decision that affected the shared property of hundreds of family members.</p>
<p>While his decision appeared to be made in good faith on the surface, it was likely that many complex factors were intertwined within it.</p>
<p>Dresner and his close aides’ whereabouts were currently unknown. If he had actually died, then he might have been killed by a family member. If he were alive, then I would ask Yeon-Hee to confirm his intentions by using her mental skills.</p>
<p>Although I used him, I didn't trust him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was said that Dresner’s mansion had been vacated during the two days when Dresner was ‘disposing’ of his family assets. The testimony given by all the employees, including the resident bodyguards, were consistent in stating that they had been instructed by the butler to vacate the mansion.</p>
<p>According to his blood relatives, there were numerous internal complaints about what Dresner had been pursuing since the end of the Day of Advent. They were chasing Dresener’s whereabouts as much as I did while also searching for forces who could succeed in the nullity suit.</p>
<p>However, it would be hard to nullify his decision. It was an issue that required my approval, but because Dresner had incinerated all the related documents, there was nothing. All that remained were the old records in the British government’s computer data. In other words, only records on the group’s shares delegated to the head of a family remained.</p>
<p>The system for maintaining the head of the Rothschild family had literally ripped them apart. Even the information about his whereabouts was gone. To be honest, I was impressed by his work. It was so meticulous that it made me think he was better than I thought.</p>
<p>Gillian included a final point before concluding his report on the investigation conducted the previous night.</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: All of the British members hope the decision will be nullified.&gt;</p>
<p>Since the British club members were hesitant to contact me directly, it was only natural for them to voice their concerns to Gillian instead. The Rothschild family was even representing British interests, so their walkout greatly impacted the British members.</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: I have something to tell you before you make a decision. There are a lot of emails that British members sent me on the dates Dresner carried out the work. The list comprises supplementary candidates to be appointed as board members for each foundation, and it consists of individuals who hold direct influence on our side. It appears that members would be receptive to the proposal.&gt;</p>
<p>To read the uncut version, go to pawread dot com.</p>
<p>He finished with the explanation that such treatment and authority were guaranteed for the new members of the foundation. I wondered whether Dresner aimed to gather my people and covertly assume control of all of the family’s assets, using me as a motive.</p>
<p>However, that would never happen because I checked the possibility of him doing that immediately after the emergence of the large public foundations. Both Kim Cheong-Soo and Gillian were suspicious of that at first.</p>
<p>&lt;Gillian: I still cannot believe this, but it looks like Dresner Rothschild risked his life and devoted his family’s entire property to you, Odin.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: I know.&gt;</p>
<p>Apart from the British members’ opinions, Gillian was indirectly saying not to revive the Rothschild family.</p>
<p>&lt;Seon-Hu: Tell the British members that the emergence of large public foundations is something we should welcome.&gt;</p>
<p>Once they realized who held the greatest authority over the foundations, they would cease their complaints.</p>
<p>I hung up at that point. Yeon-Hee had seen me working on this since last night, so she put a glass of water on my desk and left quietly.</p>
<p>I couldn’t stop myself from focusing on the documents that I had reviewed countless times. It was hard to let go of the thought that Dresner might have maliciously planted a trap. Accounting firms and the British government were also scrambling to grasp the governance structure of the thirteen foundations, but they hadn’t found anything yet.</p>
<p>I really wanted to put Dresner in front of me and ask him directly. He not only feigned being a clown, but also capitalized on working under my direction and was fixated on amassing gold. He had been obsessed with the gold collected from China and pioneering gold mines in outer space.</p>
<p>‘How could such an action be rationalized? Was it merely a facet of the capital augmentation?’</p>
<p>I couldn’t understand Dresner’s actions, yet the situation affected me deeply. All the evidence indicated that he had acted with a truly altruistic motive.</p>
<p>How could someone change this much?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That afternoon, it became evident that what Dresner had done did not disrupt the structure I had established. I just simply didn’t know what his motives were for doing so. For now, I accepted Rothshild’s walkout as a fact. It wasn’t worth paying too much attention to Rothschild as they were just a little accessory of mine. I had kept the investigation going, so if my people found something, I would get back at it again.</p>
<p>It was late in the afternoon that the Savior’s person, who left to collect insignias and Spider Egg, returned. At that moment, cheers and sighs were alternately coming out of the room where Yeon-Hee was in. I was waiting for Olivia. I still couldn’t figure out Jonathan’s intentions, but I had decided that the egg was his from the time I blocked his bid.</p>
<p>Given that I had already decided on which other dungeons to open, there was no reason for me not to return to outer space after handing over the egg to Olivia.</p>
<p>When I sensed her presence, I realized that there was another person’s heavy footsteps. I had just finished working on the design of the Teleportation insignia. The sound of them coming up was clear as my Sense was at its maximum capacity. The two footsteps stopped briefly in the elevator and resumed walking again toward me.</p>
<p>Jonathan was finally back from wandering! However, for some reason, Olivia went back without coming into the room together with him.</p>
<p>I opened the door to congratulate my comrade’s return. Jonathan shook his hands as soon as he saw me.</p>
<p>“You stole the present I was going to give you, Sun. Would you mind if I come in without anything? Long time no see, Sun.”</p>
<p>He smiled faintly, and I reciprocated with a smile too.</p>
<p>I quipped, “Wow, who is this? I was this close to forgetting your face. I thought you moved in with Olivia and lived happily ever after.”</p>
<p>“I considered that since she is a faithful woman. Are you interested in her as a girl?” he asked.</p>
<p>I laughed. “Hahahaha. It’s not even funny, man. Anyway, welcome back, Jonathan.”</p>
<p>“I needed a little break, but it took longer than I expected.”</p>
<p>Jonathan shifted his gaze over my shoulder where Yeon-Hee was leaning against the wall and gently moving her hand. She was smiling at him, but her pupils were skimming through Jonathan in suspicion. Fortunately, her eyeballs had not turned entirely black.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Stop it, Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>When I warned her, she finally stood upright and said, “I will let you guys catch up. Do not care about me.”</p>
<p>She returned to her room while giggling.</p>
<p>Jonathan’s smile vanished, and his forehead appeared noticeably tense. He spoke briefly while looking at the door where Yeon-Hee disappeared.</p>
<p>“I would rather die if I had to live with such a woman.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“She will kill the guy if he makes any mistake with her. No one other than you would be able to deal with her Sun.”</p>
<p>He stopped joking and lowered his voice immediately.</p>
<p>“I will be honest with you. I want you to mediate so that there is no dispute between Mary and me. We will get into so many conflicts, but it’s unpleasant to think that Mary reads my feelings every single time. If she reads my memories without permission…I won’t be able to tolerate that. I’d rather be physically naked instead.”</p>
<p>He was serious.</p>
<p>I explained, “She closed her Empathy skill, Jonathan.”</p>
<p>He blinked. “...Oh, yeah?”</p>
<p>“But I will let her know. Mary won’t look into your emotions or thoughts. She wouldn’t want to do that either. Let me ask you a question.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Go for it.”</p>
<p>“Where do you want to be? Outer space? Or the mainland?”</p>
<p>“Osiris is in outer space. I am always ready to help if he needs support, but I would like to stay here until then.”</p>
<p>“Okay. What exactly do you want to do here?”</p>
<p>“Some people subscribe to the notion that ‘There are no great men in the world. There is only a great challenge that ordinary people rise to meet.’ However, I haven’t encountered anyone who is cognizant of the fallacy in this belief and educates those who believe this accordingly. I will assume the responsibility, Sun.”</p>
<p>Jonathan was indeed back from his wanderings.</p>
<p>“I will keep the order in the name of the great man, you.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 387</p>
<p>A glass filled with whiskey was placed on the table. Our conversation had shifted back to the mainland after we talked about events in outer space. However, the issue that arose at this year’s club meeting became the focus of our conversation as Jonathan started talking about it.</p>
<p>He cleaned the cups from the table, then I put my laptop there. Jonathan was in charge of scrolling the page.</p>
<p>「Global Stock Market Capitalization (Unit: 1 billion USD)</p>

<p>2018 (as of the end of June): 73,200」</p>
<p>「Shareholding, Top 10 Groups (Unit: 1 billion USD / Market Capitalization)</p>
<p>As of the end of June</p>
<p>1. Jonathan Investment Finance Group: 16,329 (22.3%)</p>

<p>10. Unicorn: 852 (1.1% )</p>
<p>Total: 44,912 (61.3%) 」</p>
<p>The information was published on the Bloomberg website, but it only pertained to stocks, which was just one component of our financial empire. The figures were obtained using the electronic disclosure system, and they seemed to represent the equity structure of a specific company, rather than providing comprehensive data on the global stock market.</p>
<p>Among them, I recognized the names State Lee, Resona Finance, and Unicorn because a large amount of my capital was in them. If Bloomberg had listed the top one hundred groups, then my paper companies would have been ranked 11th.</p>
<p>“The Rothschild Group existed until the end of June…”</p>
<p>Since the name had come to my mind, I brought that up to Jonathan. No matter how much I thought about it, the process of the dismantling of the Rothschild Group would have been done by a skilled butcher. Dresner Rothschild’s eccentric actions and Jonathan, who had just returned, claiming to be the ‘Guardian of the Order…’ I wondered if all of this was a coincidence.</p>
<p>What if Jonathan had been working hard to eliminate Rothschild instead of wandering? Then, why would he withhold this information from me? If Jonathan intended to oust Rothschild, I would have provided him with a legitimate reason to do so, considering how the two of us had both contributed to the growth of the empire.</p>
<p>I had my suspicions. After all, it didn’t make sense for Rothschild to obsess over gold for the sole reason of boosting their financial growth. Perhaps the Rothschild family wanted to become the leading group in the world and take revenge on me, unlike China which had failed to do so.</p>
<p>I could have made an excuse for that, but the higher the monkeys climbed up the trees, the more visible their behinds became. Rothschild was an object to be used, not to be removed. If Jonathan did end up removing Rothschild, then he might have been conscious that we would have a disagreement.</p>
<p>Unless he asked me to replace the entire club members with new individuals, I would have agreed with his decision.</p>
<p>Jonathan said.</p>
<p>“People mistake believing that they are in full control of their minds, so they often engage in reckless and irrational behaviors. You would not have experienced such people during the Stage of Advent, but I have observed numerous people who were blinded by their greed there. Their misguided ambitions have led them down a path of destruction, which I liken to a throne made of their own skeletons. Whether one’s ambition is noble or corrupt, the result can be equally detrimental.”</p>
<p>In fact, Jessica was one of those people. If she had been in the Stage of Advent, then her bones would have become a part of Jonathan’s throne of skeletons. Since our conversation had shifted to Jessica, I told him about what Jessica had done.</p>
<p>Jonathan listened calmly and nodded.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, Sun. No one can understand you as much as I can, as I make a conscious effort to only think from your perspective without any personal biases.”</p>
<p>Trust… I regretted not trusting such a friend and believing that he was responsible for the removal of Rothschild.</p>
<p>Jonathan continued to talk while looking at the website on the monitor.</p>
<p>“The public will think that more than sixty percent of the world’s wealth has been dominated by only ten groups listed here from the Day of Advent. Then, they will condemn that the Gillian couple and I are recklessly swallowing the world.”</p>
<p>I interjected, “They can’t even wrap their heads around the idea that what has been uncovered so far is just the tip of the iceberg.”</p>
<p>Jonathan smirked, and the heavy air felt a little lighter.</p>
<p>“Such criticism will be focused on me as more time passes by. My official assets are forty-nine percent of the New York group, which is 8.1 trillion USD. The public will be blinded by the number that one individual possesses.”</p>
<p>“Then, people will start talking about John Doe, who owns fifty-one percent of the New York group, and they will realize that the Gillian couple are only our salarymen.”</p>
<p>“You have witnessed how the public’s strong rejection of huge capital had been expressed during ‘Occupy Wall Street.’ It is just a matter of time before the fuse ignites, and I believe this will be the point where the narrative transitions from being about groups in power to a select few individuals who hold power.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>He then sneered. “They will ignore how much you protected them and will only look at the figures in front of you. Like that girl, Jessica.”</p>
<p>I pointed out, “That is why this year’s club meeting called for the revival of Project Tessera.”</p>
<p>He smiled wryly. “But Sun, you confined that to only the Awakened.”</p>
<p>“And you understand why I did that?” I asked.</p>
<p>Jonathan shrugged. “I can say that I kind of know why you did it instead of completely agreeing with you.”</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“Considering the burden you are carrying… I will be honest with you. I want to unify humanity into one group and impose strong control on them. We should always keep an eye on the root of the problem to prevent it from sprouting. We need to trample on any problems immediately. Everyone should be grateful for what you have done, but Sun, I know you don’t want to make your family live in a world like that.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “That is right.”</p>
<p>“So I won’t aim my sword at such immoral and foolish people. I will keep your order itself.”</p>
<p>My commander, who had demonstrated unwavering strength in financial battlefields, had become a towering figure after returning from the Stage of Advent. Therefore, there could be no one more reliable than him to me.</p>
<p>I smiled. “Thank you, Jonathan. I will leave the mainland to you. Thanks to you, a huge burden on my shoulders is now gone.”</p>
<p>There was no need for a handshake.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was finally able to shed a heavy burden and move forward with greater ease, enabling me to focus solely on myself.</p>
<p>The next destination was not the Franklin Duchy. The Empire, the mother country of the Dukedom, was a place for the Awakened to advance, but it was not for me. After confronting Doom Caso, I had determined my next destination. My decision was solidified when Yeon-Hee confirmed seeing a memory of him in Ronsius’s recollections.</p>
<p>That was why I chose this place. A city situated along the coast sprawled out before me, with fishing boats and seagulls adorning the ocean and forming a picturesque view. Somewhere in this vicinity lay a significant battlefield from the War of New Devil.</p>
<p>Let’s see.</p>
<p>In the absence of any urgent commands from Doom Kaos, I needed to prioritize two tasks simultaneously to maximize my efficiency and save time. One was to investigate the design of the insignia and determine its limitations, while simultaneously locating the old battlefield from the War of the New Devil and collecting all the spoils, regardless of whether they belonged to the Seven Demon Kings or the Old One.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[* Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider Egg has been removed.]</p>
<p>This was the gift Jonathan gave me. The actual purchaser didn’t matter.</p>
<p>[Time left until opening: 4 days 23 hours 14 minutes]</p>
<p>The item had originally belonged to an Awakened who was in the master section and was formerly associated with the Lord of Heaven’s group. Although I didn’t hear it from him directly, he might have refrained from opening it out of respect for the Lord of Heaven. Then he probably eventually decided to relinquish it due to the burden of carrying it.</p>
<p>[* Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider Egg has been added.]</p>
<p>My attention was fixated on the moment the egg vanished into another dimension, just as it had materialized in my hands. However, I didn’t experience anything out of the ordinary except for a slight twinge. It appeared that the ability to manipulate space could only be resolved through the use of the Teleportation insignia.</p>
<p>If I could create the teleportation skill that the Fifth Virtue had in the past, it would be useful in future battles as I wouldn’t need to exhaust the power that charged very slowly to open the gate. For instance, if I could add skills while keeping the design of the insignia...!</p>
<p>In other words, it would be possible to add the desired skills to complete the list. I wanted to convert the B-class Teleportation insignia and A-class The Land of Sacred Healing insignia into actual skills. In addition, I wanted to fill my remaining spots with attack skills.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be possible to further boost my ability, which is currently stagnant at the 600s of the Ender section, when I can freely handle Mana? I might be able to figure out something more about the common power.</p>
<p>As long as it remained unknown, the potential existed in every direction. I just had to figure out how the Old One’s had designed skills and insignias.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>Einhell woke up late at night to a knock on the door.</p>
<p>“Are you Einhell?”</p>
<p>The visitor was covering his face with a hood. Except for the slightly awkward pronunciation, the guy appeared to be quite familiar with looking down on others. Einhell frowned, but he couldn’t close the door immediately because of that reason. The visitor could have been a member of the aristocracy, a formidable warrior, or even both.</p>
<p>“What brought you here?” Einhell asked.</p>
<p>The visitor responded, “I can do everything here with your name, Einhell.”</p>
<p>“That is…true, but isn’t it too late right now?”</p>
<p>Einhell somehow felt uneasy and looked at the street over the visitor’s shoulder. The city guards might have departed earlier to patrol a different area, which was probably why he couldn’t spot any.</p>
<p>“I’m looking for people familiar with old records. I want you to put the largest expedition team with them.”</p>
<p>“...Are you sure you have come to the right person? Those familiar with the old records are the officers, and the largest expedition party could be mistaken for a private organization. The higher-ups will never just allow them to do whatever they want. Okay? You are talking nonsense.”</p>
<p>His foreboding intuition had never proven to be false. During the night, an ominous stranger roused him from his sleep and began making arbitrary and unreasonable demands.</p>
<p>Then, the visitor took a familiar object out of his robe. It was gold. Einhell was unable to discern where the visitor had been concealing such a sizable piece of gold, which was even cumbersome to grasp with both hands, within his robe.</p>
<p>Despite the weight of the gold being enough to make it seem as if it would fall to the ground, the visitor’s grip was firm, and he held it as if it were a lightweight piece of paper without a tremble in his hand. Einhell now was certain that the visitor was at least a warrior in the Sword User section. The alternatively looked at the gold and the visitor with widened eyes.</p>
<p>“I have never paid more than a fair price, but today will be the exception. If you accept my suggestion, this will be yours, Einhell.”</p>
<p>“Is this a payment from good faith…?” he asked.</p>
<p>The visitor nodded slightly. “Of course.”</p>
<p>In front of his eyes, the gold bar was too large for him to resist. After a few seconds of hesitation, Einhell stretched out his hands. When the gold bar was placed in his hands, it was so heavy that he had to hold it with both hands.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t the weight that shook his hands. It was for the same reason that his voice trembled.</p>
<p>“Please come again tomorrow morning.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Um…”</p>
<p>Although the visitor continued to speak, Einhell was preoccupied with a mixture of excitement and anxiety, rendering him unable to hear what was being said. It was only after the visitor had vanished that Einhell realized that he had mentioned how Einhell had saved the city that night.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 388</p>
<p>He was certain that the visitor was one of the most affluent individuals on the planet. Einhell had to reach out to the noble families of the city and seek assistance from skilled explorers while also making substantial donations to the altar. Every time he accomplished these tasks, the guest unfailingly presented him with more gold bars.</p>
<p>He was a rich man who was searching for the relics of Lord Lacryma. Presumably, at his level, he would have already had connections to the noble families, but that wasn’t the case. In addition, Einhell had confirmed that the guest had the abilities equivalent to a Sword User, but all the man did was meditate in his room.</p>
<p>Meditation was not a common practice among warriors as it was typically reserved for wizards. Discerning the identity of the visitor was challenging and getting too close to him felt too risky.</p>
<p>One thing was clear though. The visitor was naive about the ways of the world. He claimed to have never overpaid for anything, but that was not the case. Whenever Einhell requested payment or completed the task, the visitor would generously hand over a considerable number of gold bars.</p>
<p>That day was the same. There was no answer beyond the door as always, but when Einhell carefully pushed on the door, it opened as it was unlocked. The visitor was again sitting on the bed, leaning against the wall, meditating.</p>
<p>The vibe from the visitor was quite heavy, but it wasn’t heavy enough to weigh down Einhell’s greed. He found a lump of gold right next to the door.</p>
<p>My gold… I wonder why no one took it.</p>
<p>He put the gold into the chest that he had brought specifically for that purpose and left a bill on the empty spot where the gold had been. The payment had been doubled up. It had increased little by little over the past three days, and it had finally reached this amount.</p>
<p>Einhell became the most sensitive whenever he left the room as all of his attention was solely on his back. He thought the visitor would ask about why the payment had doubled up one day, so Einhell had prepared an answer.</p>
<p>However, once again, he didn’t hear the visitor’s voice that night once again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I had a dream of hitting the jackpot last night, and you are here today, Einhell.”</p>
<p>The man talking was someone named Basman, and he was a middle-aged man with kind eyes.</p>
<p>“How have you been?” Einhell asked politely.</p>
<p>Basman shrugged. “Same as always. Flirting with girls.”</p>
<p>“I heard the news of your return a long time ago, but I was too busy. Sorry about that.”</p>
<p>Einhell looked around Basman’s place. Everyone in the city knew that Basman had weird sexual proclivities and predilection for women, and his bed was actually stained in blood. Einhell noticed that Basman was watching him, so he quickly averted his gaze from the bed to the wall.</p>
<p>Right then, Einhell noticed that a Baclan’s skull was being displayed as a trophy of war.</p>
<p>“You must have been to the North,” Einhell stated.</p>
<p>“Ah, that one. I brought it for you. I will send it to your place if you like it.”</p>
<p>Einhell shook his head. “You always say such sweet things, Mr. Basman, but I will yield it to your lovers.”</p>
<p>Basman grumbled, “Everyone always says that and refuses to take it.”</p>
<p>“If you want to dispose of it, then I will look for a place to do so. Do you want to sell it?” Einhell asked.</p>
<p>Basman waved a hand. “It’s up to you, and let’s dive into the main point. Tell me about what you have been up to. I heard that you have been getting lots of money lately.”</p>
<p>Einhell raised an eyebrow. “Wow, I didn’t expect that you would have heard about that.”</p>
<p>“Well, I know a lot about you. Who gave you all that money?” Basman asked.</p>
<p>“He is not from the city. I want to tell you more details, but that’s all I know… But Mr. Basman. I met with four officials and one priest yesterday.”</p>
<p>Basman widened his eyes and started scratching his temples while resting his chin on another hand as more money was moving under Einhell’s control than he expected.</p>
<p>“My dream last night must have been about you. I can’t believe that you are buying my sword.”</p>
<p>“How would I be able to buy that? Please help me,” pleaded Einhell.</p>
<p>Basman narrowed his eyes. “Are you saying that you will share the opportunity with me?”</p>
<p>“We are distant relatives, but…”</p>
<p>Basman pointed out, “Hey, but we are not complete strangers.”</p>
<p>“Since you are saying that, then I will tell you everything.”</p>
<p>Einhell provided a detailed and lengthy explanation to the best of his ability. The sum of the money he was dealing with was already beyond his means, and the expenses for future expedition team operations would likely be even greater.</p>
<p>Therefore, he needed someone to look after him, and Basman was the perfect candidate compared to those from the direct bloodlines of the aristocratic families.</p>
<p>After the explanation, Basman smiled. “The last drop makes the pot overflow, Einhell. But you are wise. That’s why I cherish you. Look. You came to see me first.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Umm…”</p>
<p>For the first time, Einhell spoke to the visitor who was meditating.</p>
<p>“I have someone to introduce to you. He will manage the expedition team with me.”</p>
<p>The visitor’s hood was thick and huge. Although it was difficult to check his face, it was evident that he lifted his head up toward Basman.</p>
<p>“Mr. Basman is a strong warrior and has a deep connection with the noble families of the city. His notoriety has spread to the far-off lands such as the Gemilan Kingdom in the north, the Atreus Kingdom in the central region, and the nearby Exile Kingdom. Onir, the King of Mercenaries, also spoke highly of Mr. Basman’s swordsmanship, likening it to a thunderbolt. Mr. Basman has not only assisted in eradicating the black pirates of the Strait of Pateria, but he has also been actively engaged on the front lines of the war between the Gemilan Kingdom and the Baclans.”</p>
<p>“Is he a Holy Knight?” the visitor asked bluntly.</p>
<p>Einhell choked at the moment, so Basman replied instead, “Holy Knight? It’s such an honor that you even thought of me that way. However, I sell my sword in the street, so I am not as noble as they are.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“If you are in high status, then I hope you tell us right here. If not, I will make it clear that I have no choice but to treat you only as an employer. Things will get complicated if you say something else later.”</p>
<p>The visitor’s hood shook briefly. “It doesn’t matter as long as you carry out your duties faithfully.”</p>
<p>“Fine. What is your name? What do you want us to call you?” asked Basman.</p>
<p>The visitor didn’t answer.</p>
<p>Basman paused and suggested. “Hmm… Adventure… Mr. Adventurer. How is that?”</p>
<p>The visitor responded, “Whatever you guys want to call me.”</p>
<p>Basman continued, “You’re exactly as calm as Einhell had described to me. I will take care of the expedition party so it doesn’t bother you. It only hurts to get involved with priests anyway.”</p>
<p>“How far along have things gotten?”</p>
<p>Einhell answered, “We are planning to leave tomorrow. I hurried as quickly as possible, as per your instructions.”</p>
<p>“I will follow you then,” the visitor replied.</p>
<p>Einhell interjected, “It’s going to be a rough journey. If you dispatch someone, I will ensure that they return to you immediately upon discovering the relics. I can also arrange for them to provide regular and detailed updates to you.”</p>
<p>The visitor ordered, “Save a spot for me. By the way, I don’t want to be bothered by anyone.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I will.”</p>
<p>“Then, I will see you tomorrow. You will be content with the team tomorrow,” Basman added.</p>
<p>Einhell and Basman exchanged glances and turned around.</p>
<p>Basman said as soon as they got out on the street, “He is not a noble.”</p>
<p>Despite Basman’s deliberate attempts to provoke and mock the priests of Lord Lacryma, the visitor had remained unresponsive. In addition, the visitor’s unusual enunciation and the fact that he always kept his face concealed in the hood also made Basman sure that the man was not a noble. Based on that, he surmised that the visitor’s wealth had been amassed through illegitimate means.</p>
<p>“Did you check where he is getting all that gold?”</p>
<p>Einhell shook his head. “He just somehow prepared them for me the next day whenever I brought him a bill. His men must be nearby.”</p>
<p>Basman commented, “Our visitor is mysterious in a bad way.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but there is no need to cut the goose’s belly. Let it lay the golden eggs and bring us more fortune.”</p>
<p>Basman nodded but suppressed himself from smiling because he learned from the many battlefields that fools were often filled with laughter.</p>
<p>He slowly skimmed through the visitor’s residence and put his hand on Einhell’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“I agree. No one will know how he got such wealth, but we shouldn’t stop him from spending loads of money. If our exploration ends up in a success…”</p>
<p>“Then, we will have to cut the goose’s belly. I have planned to that extent.”</p>
<p>Basman smiled. “Then, I shouldn’t be worried about it. You are closer to the family, so I will say nothing more.”</p>
<p>When the two of them took the left turn while talking on the street, they saw people gathering in the square. Some of the young aristocrats were armed with artifacts such as fancy armor that reflected the sunlight. The citizens of the city were showering them with lily petals while the priests of the Lord Lacryma swung their censers.</p>
<p>Einhell and Basman joined them without saying a word. Even the illegitimate child of the family, whose face was the only thing known about him to the two, was receiving the priests’ blessings.</p>
<p>The nature of the ritual was apparent as plans had been in place for some time to assemble an expedition team to be dispatched to the central region of the continent. It was rumored that the Devil Doom Man, who was predicted to bring the night, and his Demon Corps had appeared in the far central region.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Einhell harbored doubts about sending an expedition team to the central region. This was not only due to the vast distance, but also due to the numerous warzones that they would have to traverse.</p>
<p>Recently, many wars had started for conquest purposes. The countries with major powers employed the pretext to justify their wars, claiming that they needed to bolster their armaments to counter the Demon Corps.</p>
<p>After throwing the last lily petal, Einhell walked out of the crowd. Basman, who had left the square first, spoke.</p>
<p>“I never imagined that the illegitimate kid would bring us luck. If not, then we would have been in the squad and died eventually on the way to the central region.”</p>
<p>“Our young master won’t reach the destination.”</p>
<p>“He would know that and wouldn’t want to go. Honestly, I am not sure if the Demon has actually showed up. It might be the altar’s plan of dragging people out of the city…”</p>
<p>Right then, Basman quickly became quiet.</p>
<p>Einhell commented, “It must be true, seeing that all the major powers on the continent are moving at the moment.”</p>
<p>Basman nodded. “Yeah, we should believe that, but our young master is too inexperienced and young to resist the temptation and overcome adversity. I hope Lord Lacryma’s blessing is with him.”</p>
<p>“By the way, I don’t think it will take that long before the war impacts the city. I heard that the ships of the Emperor Exile often appear in the Strait of Pateria.”</p>
<p>Basman then remarked, “If you didn’t ask me to join here, then I would have been on that ship right now.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>Basman raised an eyebrow. “Why? Do you not think so? That’s what all the people who sell swords on the street would do. I know you have no intention of getting out of the town, so you should keep this in mind that we are forever considered illegitimate…”</p>
<p>Einhell nodded. “Yes, for sure, Mr. Basman.”</p>
<p>“I really want to take some shots today, but we should focus on work.”</p>
<p>“Then, I will look for more handymen and stop by the altar.”</p>
<p>“I will deal with those who wield swords. Let’s get as much as we can and help the goose to lay as many golden eggs as possible. Hahaha.”</p>
<p>The next morning, they gathered up. The expedition team’s size was as vast as one small kingdom, inevitably garnering more attention than the team that had been dispatched to confront the Demon Corps yesterday. It wasn’t only because their purpose was to excavate the sacred relics of Lord Lacryma.</p>
<p>A ceremony similar to one held yesterday was taking place, with priests passing by each of the hundreds of explorers, wafting incense burners.</p>
<p>Einhell’s visitor was in a separate carriage. The face within the deep hood occasionally furrowed in concentration as it roamed through unfamiliar terrain. Then, Einhell came with a scent of the incense burners.</p>
<p>“I told you not to disturb me if it is not about the relics,” the visitor said sharply.</p>
<p>“The supreme priest who will join the expedition is here. He is the priest of the Presbyterian Church of Saint Jayden. The Queen of Elsland even ordained him as their supreme priest. Stop whatever you are doing and greet him.”</p>
<p>“The Queen of Elsland ordained him directly?” the visitor asked.</p>
<p>The visitor had remained largely unimpressed even by the size of the expedition team. However, he increased the tone of his voice as if he had realized the importance of the priest’s position.</p>
<p>Einhell was finally satisfied with his reaction. “Where do you think I spent all your gold bars? I have been faithfully fulfilling your orders.”</p>
<p>He lowered his voice and continued, “Whether or not you possess a deep devotion to Lord Lacryma is of no concern to me. However, I warn you against revealing any weaknesses to him. If you want the exploration to go smoothly…”</p>
<p>The visitor interrupted him, “So he met the Queen of Elsland in person?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 389</p>
<p>Einhell noticed that the visitor and supreme priest were on bad terms as the level of reverence the visitor displayed towards the priest was unsuitable for public display. Einhell considered it fortunate that Basman’s relaxed smile had a calming effect on the priest.</p>
<p>The priest is indeed a woman like others.</p>
<p>Laughter burst out from the priest’s side, who had been cold all along. The construction of the initial campsite took place after they departed from the city.</p>
<p>Einhell said after waiting for Basman to return, “Right from the start, he nearly botched it. It is unbelievable how rude the visitor was toward the supreme priest. We should have been less cautious around him as he isn’t an aristocrat. He is just an ordinary man, lacking in education. He’s simply been fortunate enough to have plundered a noble’s storage.”</p>
<p>“Calm down. This is not like you. I see. I heard he donated in your name?” Basman said.</p>
<p>Einhell grumbled, “Yes, but he is just on my nerves right now.”</p>
<p>Einhell glanced over Basman’s shoulder. The priest who chuckled in Basman’s company now glared menacingly at the carriage carrying the visitor.</p>
<p>“What did the supreme priest say?”</p>
<p>“I barely stopped her from leaving, but it’s not because the visitor is rude. She seems to have bad instincts for him. What we saw wasn’t wrong.”</p>
<p>“He must have hailed from a deprived area and didn’t get a proper education. What a shame.”</p>
<p>“But he doesn’t even have a single bodyguard even though he has to be careful when revealing his wealth.”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know much about swords. I have only heard about it.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that we should wait until the goose starts squawking?”</p>
<p>“There is no way that he is alone. There must be another guy who cannot disclose his identity, assisting him behind the scenes.”</p>
<p>Basman nodded.</p>
<p>Einhell added, “Based on how he effortlessly handled a substantial amount of gold, my assumption was that he possessed the ability of a Sword User level.”</p>
<p>“But you think that it might be due to the Strength Magic, right?” Basman asked.</p>
<p>Einhell nodded. “Yes, you got it, Mr. Basman. You read my mind.”</p>
<p>Basman smiled. “I have known you for so long.”</p>
<p>Einhell continued, “Yeah, he can’t be a warrior. Look at him. He is stuck in there again, meditating without a sword.”</p>
<p>The visitor’s carriage was shrouded in darkness amidst the vast expedition team. Although bonfires were dispersed throughout the area, the visitor opted to remain on the outskirts, beyond the reach of the light.</p>
<p>Despite being the one who organized the team, the visitor displayed a reluctance to socialize with others. Einhell and Basman were aware that this stemmed from the fact that while the visitor had funded the team, the two of them had been the ones responsible for hiring each individual member.</p>
<p>He chose to be exposed to the outside rather than entrusting himself to us. Let’s see if he can survive by himself in monster-infested areas.</p>
<p>While Einhell fell silent as he looked at the carriage, Basman was lost in thought about the identity of the visitor.</p>
<p>Einhell then commented, “I have never seen him open his eyes. He meditates all day. Therefore, you must have more thoughts on him compared to me. What do you think?”</p>
<p>Basman responded, “Removing his robe would reveal his social status as his physique would let us know. Therefore, we should avoid making assumptions about him until we have confirmed our suspicions.”</p>
<p>“About the part where he meditates all day long…”</p>
<p>Basman interrupted, “Let’s keep watching him. By the way, how much did you push into the altar that the priest is able to tolerate this?”</p>
<p>Einhell grimaced. “You will freak out when you hear it. My hands trembled when I paid that amount.”</p>
<p>Basman shrugged. “As long as it is mutually beneficial, I don’t really mind.”</p>
<p>“I will show you the ledger once people stop paying attention to us.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you don’t have to.”</p>
<p>Einhell shook his head. “Nah, Mr. Basman. I couldn’t think that far yesterday because I was so busy.”</p>
<p>“It’s up to you. The problem is that if you continue to provoke the goose guy, then the expedition team might collapse.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s why I said we are in a risky situation. So… Umm… Never mind. I went too off-topic. Please pretend you didn’t hear any of this.”</p>
<p>Basman narrowed his eyes.“That makes me more curious. Tell me. We are on the same boat, so you shouldn’t hide anything from me.”</p>
<p>Einhell hesitated before finally saying, “...The supreme priest was interested in you, Mr. Basman.”</p>
<p>Basman guffawed. “Hahaha, I’m popular everywhere.”</p>
<p>Despite appearing to joke around, the two of them were actually serious. Basman cast another glance behind him, observing the priest as she stared intently at the visitor’s carriage. She extended her arm towards the old literature, indicating that she had remembered her responsibility.</p>
<p>Basman spoke as if he was reciting a poem while looking at the small body of the priest.</p>
<p>“Fire. Kindling. Blowing with the bellows. When the three beats are together, there will be love.”</p>
<p>Einhell blinked. “I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Basman smiled. “You don’t have to apologize. I was already into her before you mentioned it. We are meant to be, and the fire of passion between us will be kindled by Mother Nature's Mana. Our love was destined from the very start.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Mr. Basman,” Einhell apologized again.</p>
<p>“Stop it.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“The priest will never be able to leave me. You will see.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Three days had passed since the expedition party had left the city. Their campsite remained in the same spot as they were still tracing the old literature.</p>
<p>In the forest, located further outside than the visitor’s carriage, the priest was screaming in excitement under Basman. Although she covered her mouth with both hands, the priest’s heavy breathing and screams managed to escape through the narrow gaps between her bony fingers.</p>
<p>Basman removed her hands and blocked her lips with his bulky hands. Using only his hand and lips, he was adept at stimulating her peripheral nerves. Her waist repeatedly arched like a taut bowstring.</p>
<p>Basman and the priest remained silent until the end of their sexual encounter. The priest dressed carefully. The intensity of her excitement left no room for shame or fear of the judgemental gazes of her subordinates.</p>
<p>She left while hugging her trembling body as if she was running away. Only after he saw her join the camp without any trouble did Basman clench his fists as hard as he could. His fingernails pressed into his palm, and the pain radiated through his entire hands.</p>
<p>The joy of sadism, which he couldn’t reveal in front of the priest, screamed inside his fists. If he could either strangle her or even just deliver a stinging slap to her face, causing her to groan in pain, then it wouldn’t just be the Supreme Priest experiencing orgasmic pleasure.</p>
<p>Basman’s unresolved feelings only intensified his desire, making it difficult for him to collect his thoughts and return to the campsite. As a result, he often neglected to retrieve his clothes and was frequently seen with a look of frustration etched across his face.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>It took a long time before Basman finally calmed down. He came out of the bushes and approached the sentry. At that time, the sentry swallowed saliva nervously, and his expression conveyed the sense that he was aware of something he shouldn’t have seen or known.</p>
<p>“It is said that the secret between the two is known only by our Lord Lacryma, but if it’s being talked about among three, it can hardly be called a secret anymore. If rumors circulate, I’m sure they will eventually reach my ears,” Basman said.</p>
<p>The sentry was looking straight ahead without making eye contact with Basman.</p>
<p>“How long have you been a warrior?” he asked.</p>
<p>The man responded, “...It has been about three years.”</p>
<p>“Then, there is no need to say more, right?” asked Basman menacingly.</p>
<p>The sentry nodded quickly. “Yes.”</p>
<p>Basman relaxed. “I will look forward to seeing you on guard. You can return to your room now. I will take over and keep watch, so you can rest assured and get some rest.”</p>
<p>The sentry shook his head.“No, you don’t have to do this.”</p>
<p>Basman said quietly, “This is to make both of us feel at ease.”</p>
<p>“Then, I will take it.”</p>
<p>Basman sent the sentry back to his room and rummaged through the bonfire.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he shifted his gaze to the visitor’s carriage. The suppressed irritation began to cause pain in his temples again.</p>
<p>I’m doing this because of you, but you are just… ugh.</p>
<p>The visitor was still meditating in the carriage even while the rest of the camp slept. The silhouette of the man seated inside remained constant, except during meal times. Basman was impressed with his tireless passion… Well, no. It was more accurate to call it an obsession. At this point, Basman had concluded that the visitor was a wizard.</p>
<p>It’s better if he is a wizard.</p>
<p>Although Basman was unsure which magic tower the visitor belonged to, he knew that if the visitor were an outsider, then he would have been wanted by all of the towers by now. Then, if Basman had no choice but to split up the goose’s belly, he could get support from the magic towers along with assistance from his family.</p>
<p>Of course, it was unlikely that the situation would reach that far.</p>
<p>How would he be able to deal with kingdom-sized expedition forces, and how would he even confront me?</p>
<p>Basman was confident that the visitor would be weaker than him despite not knowing anything about how many subordinates he had.</p>
<p>Shortly after that, the returning expedition party arrived back at the camp, shaking their heads, Einhell and Basman managed to obtain a list. The wizard of the team stopped by the branch and brought back a list of the outsiders that were wanted by the Alaos Clique and Riuonie Clique.</p>
<p>The wizard asked, “But why do you need this list?”</p>
<p>“I inevitably have multiple enemies as I sell swords. Despite being employed instead of owning my own business, I am responsible for leading the team.”</p>
<p>Einhell added, “But I think you forgot the list wanted by Ronsius’s group, Cereville.”</p>
<p>While they referred to it as a ‘list,’ in reality, it was a sizable book consisting of two thick volumes.</p>
<p>Cereville sat in front of Einhell and Basman, and he replied, “The entire Ronsius Clique left to the central area.”</p>
<p>Before departing the city a few days ago, the Ronsius Clique branch had been in good standing.</p>
<p>Basman opened his mouth, recalling the same thing as Einhell.</p>
<p>“They seem to have decided to join the expedition team. There is Ronisus’s base in the small kingdom in the central region.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>While Basman and Einhell conversed, the wizard calmly interjected, “That is not true. By the way, it is a duchy, not a kingdom. It is said that Saint Cassian’s prophecy came to fruition in that tiny duchy for the first time. You wouldn’t have heard of the Franklin Dukedom, but you would have heard of the Wailing Mountains. The Ronsius Clique is rooted in the southern part of that mountain.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point. So?”</p>
<p>“The Demon Corps collapsed the Ronsius Clique,” responded the wizard.</p>
<p>Basman raised his voice, “What? How can such a thing happen? I feel bad for Ronsius’s people.”</p>
<p>The wizard continued, “That’s not all. I delved deeper into the matter out of disbelief, only to discover that even the Holy Knight King Onyx and Caldoran had met their demise in that very land, Basman.”</p>
<p>“When did this happen?” Basman asked, frowning.</p>
<p>Cereville replied, “This took place more than a month ago.”</p>
<p>At that time, Einhell was struck by an even more baffling realization. It was rumored that as a result of an agreement between a small country in the central area and the red-faced orcs, the orcs had occupied some parts of the Wailing Mountains.</p>
<p>Einhell mentioned that, and the wizard and Basman were already aware of the red-faced orcs’ bravery.</p>
<p>While it was indeed a small country in the central region where the incident had occurred, all of the deceased were renowned for their courage and greatness even in the far eastern lands.</p>
<p>“You are similar to us, Cereville.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” asked the wizard.</p>
<p>“If you were in Ronsius’s group, you would definitely be dragged to the central area.”</p>
<p>While the Ronsius Clique’s foundation was based in the central region, all of the wizards in the branch, except for the head, were from the eastern territories. Nevertheless, they needed to risk their lives to resolve the issue that happened in the central legion.</p>
<p>The wizard Cereville smiled as he remembered the empty Ronsius Clique’s branch.</p>
<p>“I will go back to my spot, then. If you have any questions, please let me know, Mr. Basman.”</p>
<p>After Cereville left, Einhell and Basman examined the list of outsiders. Upon careful analysis of the documented criminal activities, they were able to narrow down the list to approximately ten affluent individuals. After excluding female suspects, the number was reduced to seven and further decreased to four after eliminating physically smaller and less imposing individuals.</p>
<p>They tried taking into account the visitor’s poor pronunciation, which excluded the possibility of him being of aristocratic bloodline, but then there were zero left. Therefore, there were four suspects in the end.</p>
<p>Einhell wrote down the four names and sent the list to the city. He knew they wouldn’t be able to grasp the visitor’s identity, but there was a possibility that it could happen and it didn’t take that much of an effort. He only needed to use a small portion of the gold he had pocketed. Additionally, he could cover up the missing gold by slightly rearranging some of the books.</p>
<p>While the priests were engrossed in pursuing the old literature, the returning expedition team was taking a break, and cooks were busy preparing meals, Einhell noticed a hand gesture made by the visitor emerging from the carriage window.</p>
<p>“Did you call me?” he asked.</p>
<p>The visitor stated, “This area has been frequently explored in the past.”</p>
<p>Einhell responded, “But not on this scale.”</p>
<p>The visitor sharply asked, “Do you think I pay for you to play around in a safe area?”</p>
<p>“Play around? You are crossing the line. Look at all the exhausted guys who had just come back from work. They are trying their best to accomplish what you want day and night. Hey, many people are well-versed in exploration, and priests are hard-working. You should first ask the experts on why they specifically chose this location…”</p>
<p>The visitor interrupted, “You talk too much. There was no need to hire this many warriors and wizards if we were going to stay here being unproductive.”</p>
<p>The visitor had hit the mark, but Einhell pretended that the visitor was wrong.</p>
<p>“Of course, it’s because we care about your safety,” he said soothingly.</p>
<p>“It’s common sense that the remains of the safe area have already been excavated a long time ago, Einhell.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>The visitor commanded, “Enter the canyon as soon as the returnees take a rest.”</p>
<p>“I’m in a position to take responsibility for your safety as well. That is why I’m asking this, so don’t take it offensively. Have you ever seen a Graf in person?”</p>
<p>Einhell added, “I’d bet that you will shudder if you face them, Mr. Adventurer.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 390</p>
<p>The carriage that I was in stopped in front of the guard post. The access road to the canyon was obstructed by a stone wall, which had hardened Graf’s bodily fluids in its crevices. Additionally, artificial Mana had been directed to flow on the ground.</p>
<p>The flow was definitely made to prevent Grafs from digging under the barrier. The flow appeared to have been deliberately designed to mimic Odin’s Wrath Mana flow, possibly to electrocute any Grafs that attempted to enter the basement. It was wide and powerful.</p>
<p>The streams of mana were coming out of a gigantic tower-like water. The expansive network of barbed wire underground was established on this premise.</p>
<p>The giant tower, where the magic power was concentrated, wasn’t only used when confronting Grafs. Since I was aware that they could be used in wartime, I wasn’t really fond of them.</p>
<p>After some time, I found myself fully engrossed in the world of Mana once again. However, the sensation of my sweat-soaked robe clinging to my back was becoming more prominent than the vibrations that were being transmitted to my hip, causing me to lose focus. I started to hear some noise from outside as well.</p>
<p>“As far as I can remember, Mayer[1] Vivatus’s reign was the last suppression.”</p>
<p>“That’s what the chief of the office said. This is so weird. There is not even a single Graf. No one can describe this situation without the Blessing of Lord Lacryma…”</p>
<p>Despite my attempts to refocus, my concentration remained entirely disrupted. At the moment, I relaxed my Sense, and a stinging sensation began from my head and shook my entire body with severe pain. It was because I had maintained my Sense to its maximum for too long.</p>
<p>I opened the curtain that was covering the window, and sunlight came into the carriage. The red-toned wasteland unfolded. When I looked outside by peeking my head out through the window, not only the dried-up old riverside but also the cliffs that seemed to have been carved were gone. This was a moment that the tension felt by everyone as they passed through the canyon became meaningless.</p>
<p>However, the canyon was only the entrance to the full-fledged habitat of the Grafs, so the formation of the expedition team remained the same in case of unexpected battles.</p>
<p>Einhell, the Supreme Priest Manolia, Cereville, and Basman were people who required protection, so they were walking close to the carriage. Einhell stopped talking to Basman and looked at me. Basman was speaking to the priest as he was afraid that the priest would pick a quarrel with me.</p>
<p>Einhell asked, “Do you need anything?”</p>
<p>I simply responded, “I’m hungry.”</p>
<p>“It’s the first time you’ve asked for a meal. Please wait a little longer. We are almost there.”</p>
<p>Some of the explorers had experience in this area, but not Einhell.</p>
<p>The team had established their headquarters in an area that they had used before, but there were indications that it had been abandoned for several years. Finger bones and skulls protruded out of the old tombs, and many pits that seemed to have been dug out by the Grafs remained. Most of these pits were still blocked.</p>
<p>While everyone was helping to set up the main camp, I was ready to get out of the carriage. My presence had not left a favorable impression on others, as I seemed to only appear when I needed to use the washroom. Furthermore, the priest had taken an immediate dislike to me upon our first meeting.</p>
<p>There was no need to grab more attention by showing them the color of my hair and eyes. There was no one here who had the ability to take my hood off, so it was unnecessary to dye my hair or wear colored contacts. The hood had proved to be an effective form of camouflage, prompting me to pull it further down over my face.</p>
<p>A meal had been prepared on the outside. I was at the table even when the team members were scattered to different directions with the literature collections held by the priests in their hands.</p>
<p>Einhell and Basman were whispering shit about me, then Basman trudged along and sat down in front of me. He had drooping eyes and was easily liked by people. Those eyes, which appeared to carry a perpetual smile even when at rest, fixed upon me.</p>
<p>“Always keep an eye on me, and run to me as soon as you feel a vibration on the ground. I won’t be far from you either. And about Manolia…you already know that she doesn’t really trust you.”</p>
<p>Basman shifted his gaze toward the priest and watched her move. She was praying on the side, expressing her gratitude to Lord Lacryma for letting us go through the canyon without a single attack.</p>
<p>Considering that she had instantly felt an instinctual dislike toward me, it seemed that those who worshiped the Old One had something like an antenna that detected the Old One’s enemies. However, she apparently didn't know that her fate after the exploration was already determined. She would have no choice but to bring me to the Queen of Elsland.</p>
<p>“Your faith is not that deep, so it’s better not to converse with her as much as possible. I have high expectations for this exploration. If it ends successfully, then I will have a great reputation. I just wanted to let you know that I will do my best.”</p>
<p>A large portion of the ridiculously inflated bill was for this guy. He was in a higher status than the wizard, probably because he had been immersed in the flow of Mana.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, he was looking inside me. His mana was constantly moving, with four ellipsoids interlocked at one point. The large shape itself didn’t deviate from its resemblance to a four-leaf clover, but it showed great variability as if a large stone was thrown into the river.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I remembered that Onir’s movement was slow and quiet. This was the difference between a person who had been steadily practicing the traditional swordsmanship and another one who had been refining his own sword since he accidentally entered the path of Mana.</p>
<p>In other words, the more organized the mana flow was, the better skill the individual had. That was the world of warriors.</p>
<p>Hwak-!</p>
<p>I sensed a penetrating sensation within my intense headache. I came to the sudden realization that my ability to read the flow of Mana had improved significantly. All the effort I had invested in linking the rotational power of the skill to the insignia had not been in vain. The time that I had spent not drinking and eating for a few days was meaningful.</p>
<p>Progress was being made.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Neither Einhell nor Basman disturbed me that night.</p>
<p>[* Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider Egg]</p>
<p>[Time remaining until opening: 3 minutes]</p>
<p>[Warning: Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider Egg will be opening soon.]</p>
<p>The wiggling sensation was unique. When I opened my eyes, messages were on the window, waiting for me. The campsite outside the window had yet to be attacked by the Grafs, but it was still filled with palpable tension. After the expedition team departed, the number of guards had increased by more than double due to the vacant positions.</p>
<p>Also, the large shadows were shaken by the light of the torch as huge weapons that would be used to kill Grafs were set up in the wall.</p>
<p>I knew how big the Spider Egg would be, so I needed to move to a spacious vacant lot where there was no one.</p>
<p>After passing by Basman and Priest Manolia, who were engaged in sexual activity in the darkness, I wandered off to a distant area from the main camp. My purpose was to find a region where there was no deadlock with the scattered exploration team.</p>
<p>The moonlight was mostly covered by the clouds, so I couldn’t distinguish anything without Night Eye. The egg, which was about to reveal itself, came out of the air. I put it down on the ground and distanced myself from it.</p>
<p>Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider Egg…</p>
<p>The spider monster with sixteen red eyes woke up with a terrific roar. The rocks that used to fill up the space inside the egg turned into dust. The giant spinneret had already begun to shoot out sticky threads like streams of urine.</p>
<p>At that time, the red eyes of the spider shifted their focus in all directions, then fixed on me. When it stood straight with eight legs, I also had to raise my head to look at its eyes.</p>
<p>Since the clouds were covering the entire sky, the red eyes glaring down at me resembled crimson starlight. The massive legs that filled my vision appeared like pillars of a temple that bridged the gap between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>The Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider moved. It dug through the earth and stirred up dust, appearing as if it was intoxicated by the joy of waking up in this world.</p>
<p>If there was a cliff to climb nearby, then I would have tested the Common Power concentrated in me there, but the canyon was far away.</p>
<p>The spider dug a cave the size of its body under the ground and disappeared. The outside of the pit was being crushed by the soil sucked into the cave. The spider’s movements from one patch of ground to another were quite expansive.</p>
<p>Although I wasn’t sure what was occurring underground, when the spider reemerged and revealed itself, a red light could be observed emanating from its lower abdomen. Every time the spider breathed and inflated its belly, the red light became vivid like that of the skeletal dragon just before it vomited breath.</p>
<p>I stretched my hand to the spider at that point to make it calm down. Sixteen red eyes looked down at me silently for a while, then…</p>
<p>[Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider has recognized you as its master.]</p>
<p>[* Absolute Master: No time limit has been applied.]</p>
<p>At that moment, the spider’s raised legs, engorged abdomen, and menacingly bared venomous fangs all abruptly receded as if it was swearing obedience to me.</p>
<p>The skeletal dragon had a strict time limit. If I deviated beyond that limited time, then I lost control of it. However, if such restrictions were removed, I could use it independently, similar to how Yeon-Hee handled the Kciphos King.</p>
<p>The spider lowered its posture, and I grasped the meaning of its action when it put its head on the ground. Starting from the moment I climbed onto the spider, it began to dig underground as it was immersed with the joy it showed before.</p>
<p>The spider was as skilled at digging as the adult Grafs, and I had already known how talented it was at burrowing caves when the Eight Evil was its owner in the past.</p>
<p>It had already created several underground tunnels. It appeared to have wanted to show off its ability. Another message appeared in the huge space of the cave.</p>
<p>[* Absolute Master: You may instruct it to use a unique skill ‘Breeding.’]</p>
<p>The spider’s venomous fangs clattered before me, and it began to forcefully extrude thread from its anus. I realized now that the Eight Evil didn’t take full advantage of owning this spider in the past.</p>
<p>[* Absolute Master: The level of the item has significantly increased.]</p>
<p>This was an item that was capable of growing further.</p>
<p>1. not a typo, looks like a title ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 391</p>
<p>Reproduction!</p>
<p>After confirming its true ability, I realized that Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider would be more useful to Joshua than either Jonathan or me. After all, Joshua specialized in forming his own corps by using the skill Osiris’s Domain.</p>
<p>Moreover, he succeeded the old vampire corps. In other words, he had great potential to expand the corps as the former vampire monarch.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was impossible for the spider to acknowledge him as its ‘absolute master’ since even the Eighth Evil, who had previously fostered it to its fullest potential in the past, failed to do so.</p>
<p>The spider squirmed its anus and looked down at me while exposing its poisonous fangs. I said, “Let’s see how far you can go. Give birth to as many as you want.”</p>
<p>[You have ordered the Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider to reproduce.]</p>
<p>The last scene I saw was the spider pulling out a thick thread.</p>
<p>I left the spider in the cave and returned to the campsite. It was a real mess there. The tension had reached its peak since no Grafs had attacked yet, which was quite out of the norm. Of course, the expedition team had mistaken the movement of the spider for the Grafs.</p>
<p>The supreme priest Manolia and wizard Cereville were grouped together and were looking in all directions while being surrounded by warriors who were acting as walls of bodyguards. In addition, operators were on board the anti-Graf shooting weapon.</p>
<p>Einhell rushed toward me and screamed out of the blue, “I have been looking for you! You have always stayed in that carriage, but why now…”</p>
<p>His eyes were even filled with tears, and his face was overwhelmed with concern. If he had assumed that the Grafs had swallowed his golden goose, then his heart would definitely have sunk.</p>
<p>Cereville’s magical sphere emitted light as it floated in the air and the people were all holding lit torches, so the surroundings were quite bright.</p>
<p>“I told you it is dangerous to move alone, Mr. Adventurer,” said Basman as he approached us. His eyes had turned red.</p>
<p>Although he ran in front of me, he was busy staring beyond me.</p>
<p>“The Grafs are clever. We shouldn’t belittle them simply because they look hideous. It’s fortunate that we are large in size compared to them. If not, you would have been in Graf’s stomach by now.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>The man continued, “Do not overestimate our abilities. If you are strong enough, you wouldn’t have needed to hire us.”</p>
<p>Basman pointed to one side with his sword, and Einhell added, “This way, please.”</p>
<p>I shook off Einhell’s hand as it reached towards me. Then, I headed to the place where they had prepared for me. Yes, it was inside the wall of warriors, where wizards and supreme priests were protected.</p>
<p>“Where did you go?”</p>
<p>The supreme priest’s voice was high-pitched and exuded hostility toward me at the same time. From her neck, I could smell the bark of a tree. It was the bark that Basman always chewed, and I could smell the same scent not only on the back of her neck but also everywhere on her robe.</p>
<p>She couldn’t avoid my Sense. Basman had definitely licked every part of her body. The image of Basman burying his face into her breast and Manolia opening her lips with her head tilted back came up in my mind.</p>
<p>Although she had a stern face, she collapsed easily at the touch of a middle-aged man. Alternatively, Basman could also be skilled in captivating women and inducing them to experience orgasm.</p>
<p>Anyway, the more entangled their relationship became, the less likely she was to leave the team even though she couldn’t stop herself from showing blatant hostility to me. Basman was binding her down with his masculinity.</p>
<p>I stared at her without replying. The supreme priest clearly thought that I was ignoring her. As I was scanning the Mana in her, she seemed to be trying to identify the cause of the ominous intuition she had from me.</p>
<p>She asked first, “Do you have nothing to tell me?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t about my origins, as she had hoped. If Einhell and Basman stuck to their plan of not cutting open the goose’s belly, then I only intended to disclose my identity to the priest with Yeon-Hee while she was with me, despite the fact that the priest would be upset if she found out. Nonetheless, if the two decided to alter their plan, such as dissecting the goose, then my plan may be jeopardized.</p>
<p>Anyway, there had been some actions that the priest had displayed the past few days that caught my eye. Her eyes had often flashed in excitement. It was inaccurate to say that the reason was solely due to Basman’s charms because she sometimes rummaged through old books alone.</p>
<p>“I thought I would hear at least one name by now,” I said.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” she asked.</p>
<p>I continued, “I have provided all the support you said you needed. I hired people who knew a lot about Saint Cassian’s archives to read them, but you haven’t found a single name. I understand it takes a lot of time to excavate remains. Then, shouldn’t we have obtained at least some understanding of the type of ruins we are exploring? Manolia. Have you heard of how much gold I donated to the altar in the name of Einhell?”</p>
<p>The Supreme Priest frowned as if she had never been treated like this before. The moment I was about to say the specific number, Einhell scrambled in.</p>
<p>He blustered, “What an irreverent attitude…”</p>
<p>At the same time, the Supreme Priest angrily exclaimed, “Doom Entegasto!”</p>
<p>All eyes were on her.</p>
<p>“Is that enough?” she screamed.</p>
<p>The atmosphere became so still that time felt frozen. The only movement came from the blinking eyelids of the people around me. Everything else was completely still, and a single second seemed to stretch on for what felt like ten minutes.</p>
<p>The name was a surprise to me too. I had thought that it would be Doom Insectum as this was Grafs’ habitat, but Doom Entegasto?</p>
<p>Regret was spreading on the priest’s face, and the other priests who had been working on the same study with her widened their eyes.</p>
<p>“I was going to let you know soon.”</p>
<p>She spoke bitterly to us, but her words were directed specifically at Basman, not me.</p>
<p>Basman said while coming out of the crowd, “I think I heard it wrong, Ms. Manolia. I heard the name of the wicked evil.”</p>
<p>He was protesting. The Supreme Priest nodded with a remorseful expression. She knew she couldn’t reverse the time, so she seemed to be struggling.</p>
<p>The priests tried to stop her, but it was too late. Her eyes were already fixed on Basman. When Basman sighed as if he was disappointed in her, she continued to talk, ignoring Basman’s gesture telling her to follow him.</p>
<p>“This may be…the place where Saint Jayden fought against Doom Entegasto. Then, it means you are standing in the Holy Land. I hope Lord Lacryma’s blessing is on us.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Relics were grouped by class. They were considered S-class if they had a connection to Holy Knights such as Saint Cassian or Saint Jayden, while those linked to the second greatest Demon King Doom Entegasto would be classified as SS-class. Then, they would be as explosive as the Man Who Overcomes Adversity.</p>
<p>Of course, the expedition team was filled with excitement. However, the location where the most exhilaration took place was the remote region where Basman and the Supreme Priest were engaging in sexual activity.</p>
<p>The statement, “There is no religion and truth under the navel,” was an apt portrayal of the Supreme Priest. She was the one who secretly called Basman out even on the night when the team was in a chaotic state when they thought that the Grafs were making a fuss.</p>
<p>She had become sexually awakened.</p>
<p>“You should have told me.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Basman. I wasn’t sure until now. It hasn’t been long since I…”</p>
<p>“Since when did you have those suspicions?”</p>
<p>“Umm…not too long ago.”</p>
<p>I then heard a subtle groan before they resumed their conversation.</p>
<p>“But everyone heard you. You went too far by mentioning Saint Jayden.”</p>
<p>“I couldn’t help it as I mentioned the name of the Demon King at first. If I stopped there, then everyone would have been afraid of…”</p>
<p>“How did you find that out?”</p>
<p>Following that, I heard the obscene noise of tongues intermingling together. Although Basman wasn’t my subordinate, what he did was outstanding. He had prevented the priest from leaving the expedition team, and he drew out the secrets that had been hidden inside her mind.</p>
<p>Moreover, Einhell was also impressive. He added everything possible to the bill to increase the cost and take advantage of my finances. Apart from Saint Cassian’s archives in the altar, he had bought thousands of local ancient books that had spread throughout the city.</p>
<p>Also, he raised the total bill by employing cart loads and purchasing additional groceries for the handymen, resulting in yet another increase in cost. Einhell did all of this to embezzle money, but some of the trashy old books he bought ended up inspiring the Supreme Priest.</p>
<p>“Okay, Ms. Manolia.”</p>
<p>While the Supreme Priest listed the books that inspired her, Basman interrupted her as if they were not important.</p>
<p>“Anyway, the Mayers in the City Coalition will hear about this as soon as we arrive.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think that far… Ah… No… Don’t stop. Keep going!”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying this to blame or scold you. What I’m afraid of is that I might have to leave you. Do you think the Mayers will leave you alone?”</p>
<p>“They can’t afford to even care about me as they are busy watching Emperor Exile.”</p>
<p>“No, the most sacred and important action is to alter the circumstance. Otherwise, consider the possibility that this information may reach Emperor Exile. Although you only meant to tell the truth, you might have triggered a war.”</p>
<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>“If we finish the excavation in this exploration, everything will be fine. I will do my best for you, so you must do your best to help our team.”</p>
<p>“Ahhh…! Yes, yes. Of course.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Thanks to Basman’s sincerity, the Supreme Priest became a workaholic, toiling day and night. She displayed a large map showing the expanding reach of the exploration teams, while stacks of ancient books were piled up nearby.</p>
<p>I didn’t just stand back and watch. I used my Sense on the surroundings to check if anything was taking place while exploring Mana. However, I didn’t feel anything special. Contrary to what the team feared and anticipated, no Grafs had attacked the campsite yet.</p>
<p>It was a noteworthy day for me, as I had made enough progress to remember the rotational power of the skill even after leaving the world of Mana. Furthermore, the food cart, which was once filled to the brim with ingredients, was nearly empty, resulting in a significant reduction in the number of dishes on my table.</p>
<p>Einhell and Basman were also reducing the size of their own meals. They were more passionate about the exploration than I was. They might hand me a greedy bill in the name of a second expedition, but their goal had long been changed from gold to sacred subjects. Both were convinced that this place would soon be overtaken by the powers of the city union as soon as they returned to the city.</p>
<p>After all, this was a place where Saint Jayden fought against Demon King Doom Entegasto, where the Grafs had disappeared. Even in my uneducated opinion, people in power nearby would use all means to take over the territory.</p>
<p>Therefore, if this first exploration ended in failure, then I was planning to take appropriate actions to not let anyone access my territory.</p>
<p>However, one of the exploration teams returned with a shout of joy that day.</p>
<p>“Ms. Manolia was correct!”</p>
<p>Einhell and Basman were not the only ones who couldn’t control their excitement. The Supreme Priest didn’t even think about washing her hands, which were full of disgusting odors and stains. She raised her arms like a superstar who encouraged the audience’s cheers. It was a gesture to move the campsite there as soon as possible, and it was the first time that progress had been made in the team.</p>
<p>Right when everyone was excited to move the campsite, something happened.</p>
<p>Ddddd-</p>
<p>The fucking vibrations started again and disrupted me. A wave of anger washed over me as I had been so close to entering the world of Mana. The laborers were shaking and searching for pickaxes used by the exploration team.</p>
<p>Ddddd-</p>
<p>I was certain that the vibrations weren’t created by the spider as my faithful pet was breeding in its cave. As the underground moved, the dirt moved up and down, narrowing the distance into a large shape. I was confident that they were adult Grafs.</p>
<p>[Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider has entered the battle.]</p>
<p>Except for the direction in which the spider had built its house, a flock of Grafs, including adult Grafs, rushed in from the rest of the directions. The entire ground was turning upside down in the direction they were coming in.</p>
<p>Basman shouted when he could clearly see the wobbles of the ground, “Adult Graf! They are Adult Grafs-!”</p>
<p>Upon hearing the shriek, I concluded that the Grafs were insane.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 392</p>
<p>It was more accurate to say that they “exploded.” Only a small number of individuals observed the emergence of adult Grafs from beneath the ground, as soil erupted in all directions and cascaded down. Despite only a portion of their bodies being visible, these adult Grafs had already begun to obscure the sky, casting vast shadows that darkened the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The size of each joint was so large that I could barely see the head of the Grafs as I bent my head back to look up. The size of one Graf alone was mind-blowing, but seeing over thirty of them popping up like that was overwhelming. I had never seen something like this before.</p>
<p>It appeared that those Grafs who had been avoiding me earlier decided to show up at once. In addition to the giant ones, there were also mid-sized and baby Grafs as well. Therefore, when they rose in three directions, it looked like a scene from Jurassic Park in a jungle.</p>
<p>An adult Graf stood upright in the center of the campsite. Meanwhile, the expedition team members fell from the sky and screamed.</p>
<p>“Aaaargh-!”</p>
<p>There were so many Grafs swarming in that the expedition team was completely overwhelmed and couldn't handle the situation. Even the emergency system they had in place proved to be useless. Basman, who was the strongest member of the team, was too preoccupied with keeping himself alive to help anyone else.</p>
<p>He was also holding the Supreme Priest in one arm as if she had told him the way to escape. Although he was shouting, telling everyone to retreat, it appeared that he had no intention of actually leading a retreat for Einhell and the other explorers. In the blink of an eye, the team fell apart, leaving everyone to fend for themselves and focus on their own survival.</p>
<p>The adult Grafs began to spew out green venom in such large quantities that it was akin to a fire hydrant bursting open rather than a mere shower. They were on the verge of turning around and dousing everything in the area with their poisonous spray. This was especially alarming considering how small the entire camp was compared to the vast surrounding area they had already occupied!</p>
<p>Right then, the carriage that I was in also melted.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Dark Robe of Eos[1] has been added.]</p>
<p>I took out the robe that was useful for disguising me.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Ethereal Animal.]</p>
<p>I spread my wings and raised my tails. The one who was aiming at me was an absolute idiot. Despite seeing its fellow being trampled under my feet as it attempted to swoop down and attack me, and despite realizing that its poison was ineffective against my blazing flame wings, the idiot didn’t hesitate to continue to charge toward me.</p>
<p>When I smacked the ground with my Alpha, Beta, and Gamma tails, the embers sparked up. The fire penetrated the poison and soared up. I could have pierced its head, but that would be unnecessary. As soon as I removed the wings that were blocking my line of sight, its wide open jaw was right in front of me.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Zeus’s Thunder Spear has been removed.]</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Wrath.]</p>
<p>[Subject: Zeus’s Thunder Spear]</p>
<p>In just a split second, I seized the spear and watched as lightning surged up its length. After the bolt pierced through Graf's skull, I jolted its writhing jaw and then shot upwards once more.</p>
<p>Looking down at the ground from above, it brought to mind my memories of the past. It resembled a scaled-down version of the apocalypse, where the Graf Clan, under the leadership of the Adult Graf, had annihilated humans and cities with their poisonous attacks.</p>
<p>I thrust the spear into one spot in the air. Regardless of how big they were, lightning bolts poured into the Graf’s heads.</p>
<p>As the blue light flashed before me, I sensed multiple presences that dared to leap forward and challenge me.</p>
<p>[You have used Devi’s Sword.]</p>
<p>I threw a sickle that would cut the remaining Graf’s throats, then turned to the ones that challenged me.</p>
<p>The shoreline came into view as I traversed the barren wasteland. Across the sea lay the home of the Seven Demon Kings, known as the ‘Continents of Death.’ Not all of the Demon Corps had a stronghold there. Only the Barba, Graf, Baclan, and Maruka were established there, having occupied those territories since their birth.</p>
<p>In fact, the Greenwood Continent and other species were barely surviving under my watch. Monsters were just targets of subjugation here, but we couldn’t even dream of exploring the Continents of Death.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the coast and found the origin of the Graf Clan, I could feel at once that it had passed the sea far from the Continent of Death. It had definitely gone through the War of New Devil. Also, it was the one who had occupied the Continent of Death and made it into the Land of the Graf Clan.</p>
<p>If I were to compare it to any of the Declans, then I would say that it was more akin to the leader of the mainland Declans rather than just a priest who had crawled on fours before me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, it didn’t shiver when it saw me. Instead, it unfolded its wings, which only the original species had, and flew at the same altitude as me. It acted as if it expected me to come by wriggling its jaw, which was often used to partake in cannibalism, and glaring its three eyes. I could understand that it was acting like a human.</p>
<p>Slap-!</p>
<p>I wrapped Alpha around its neck, wrapped around its upper body with Beta including its arms, and wrapped its legs with Gamma. Then, the fire that had been scattered intensified into flames and began to burn its body. Its agony was evident in the way it struggled.</p>
<p>However, it unexpectedly overcame the power of my tails. Just as it was on the verge of freeing itself from the bindings, I thrust my spear into it. However, its chitin proved be quite hard. A shower of fiery and electric debris erupted before I finally sensed the feeling of my spear piercing it. When the tip of the spear came out from the opposite side of its body, I twisted the spear downward and threw it on the ground as hard as I could.</p>
<p>BANG!</p>
<p>Despite the pain that had been inflicted by the lightning rods piercing its body, the Graf refused to release the spear. I leapt to the ground and stomped down with all my might on the end of the spear. It plunged deep into its body, burying its long shaft underground before erupting once more with lightning bolts.</p>
<p>I quickly retrieved the spear, rolling it back into my grasp. I then focused my lightning power with the intention of shattering its face.</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>Its entire form was being pulled toward the sea by a powerful suction force, making it difficult for me to keep my balance.</p>
<p>The ocean was swirling. The object that had ensnared the Graf, which was being pulled down by the current, turned out to be one of the tentacles of a Maruka.</p>
<p>Doom Insectum?</p>
<p>The Graf Clan worshiped Doom Insectum, but the Maruka Clan also considered it as their god.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sea calmed down, and I could discern Doom Insectum’s face as it emerged halfway above sea level. It wasn’t as huge as Doom Caso and the Adult Graf, but I could feel that there was something even greater that was inside it as it glared at me with two eyes.</p>
<p>The cold force exuded a sense of serenity, but also a hint of unease. Doom Insectum seemed restricted, unable to unleash its full potential from its current position, similar to Doom Caso!</p>
<p>“What Doom Kaos is most wary of is the internal conflicts between monarchs!”</p>
<p>It said the same thing as Doom Caso had.</p>
<p>I responded, “Then you would know that I’m the leader now.”</p>
<p>I didn’t like the way it peeked out only half of its face. When I swung my spear and cut down the water, the seawater that was covering its body was swept in that direction and returned to its original state.</p>
<p>I was able to see its whole body in a flash. It was roughly the same size as me and possessed massive rakes, yet there was nothing particularly remarkable about its appearance save for its wings, which was reminiscent of the original Graf species. Oh, and it also had the tentacles of the Maruka Clan wriggling on its chin.</p>
<p>Instead, the true difference lay in the string that bound it. It was made of strong energy and was tied to the area below its neck. Furthemore, the string appeared to extend to the endless deep sea.</p>
<p>The ancient Holy Knight Saint Jayden was probably very powerful as he was capable of sealing both Doom Insectum and Doom Caso, and then was able to confront Doom Entegasto.</p>
<p>I said, “I will tell you again. I’m the leader here. You have no right to tell me what to do.”</p>
<p>Anyway, I felt like Doom Insectum was aiming for the ruins that Doom Caso had pointed at. Otherwise, it couldn’t have shown up at this time. Maybe it had already acquired the relics even though it couldn’t use them.</p>
<p>“Remove the seal first if you want to say something. Doom Kaos must want that too.”</p>
<p>Although I was provoking it, it didn’t answer me. It was a taciturn monarch. Doom Insectum’s two eyes were positioned below the sea level with half its face submerged, and they scrutinized me in a discreet manner.</p>
<p>It replied to me a few minutes later, “Any warnings will likely be ignored by you.”</p>
<p>Following that, it disappeared inside the ocean, leaving with a deep grudge against me. It was definitely up to something, so I had to hurry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Dark Robe of Eos has been removed.]</p>
<p>When I came back to the campsite, spiders that were as big as a house were skulking about. They were preoccupied with hauling the dead bodies of Grafs underground. While a single spider could manage to drag a small corpse with ease, it took multiple spiders to transport the medium to larger-sized Grafs. They cut the bodies and wrapped each part with the thread they produced from their anuses.</p>
<p>The Graf corpses were vanishing beneath the surface, while on the other side, the surviving team members had congregated in the ‘Healing Zone,’ which appeared to be a creation of the Supreme Priest. The area was similar to the insignia I had which was called ‘The Land of Sacred Healing.’ Although a considerable difference between their power existed, the basic mechanism was the same.</p>
<p>I didn’t step into the area that the priest created because I had a feeling that it wouldn’t be beneficial to me even if I didn’t test it.</p>
<p>Ddddd-</p>
<p>Meanwhile, even though the battle was over, the ground was still shaking. This continued as the giant jaw spewed out soil like a fountain while my loyal spider sunk its fangs into the head of the Adult Graf and dragged it down to the ground.</p>
<p>At that time, I made eye contact with Basman and Einhell, who were looking around in bewilderment. They were in the middle of a few survivors.</p>
<p>Basman walked out of the Healing Zone. He pulled up Mana by leaping over the puddles filled with acidic poison and displaying warrior-like movement. The first thing he said as he saw me wasn't related to whether I was still alive or not.</p>
<p>“Did you see that, too? Saint Jayden…did save us…”</p>
<p>His voice trembled with emotion. I soon realized why the survivors had made a mistake, as the “Flaming Wings” often appeared in the legend about Saint Jayden, and the revered Holy Knight had similarly been portrayed with wings ablaze. Therefore, they were only startled by the vibrations that were caused by the spider for a brief moment. Before long, they regained the look of awe and worship in their eyes. In fact, Basman was one of them.</p>
<p>The reason why the expedition had to be stopped, even for the sake of the Supreme Priest’s wishes, was also for that reason. They said they couldn’t let the holy land, which was directly affected by the divine power of Saint Jayden, be defiled.</p>
<p>Are we stopping the expedition? Right before reaching the ruins?</p>
<p>Given the circumstances, I had no choice but to advance the plan. The expedition had to continue. I needed to quickly confirm what was inside the ruins and what was happening as long as Doom Insectum was nearby.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Dark Robe of Eos has been added.]</p>
<p>I put the robe inside the storage box and ignited the fire that I had extinguished.</p>
<p>The wings spread wide enough to obstruct my peripheral vision. Basman wasn’t surprised by my hair or eye color. His eyes were glued onto the burning wings. Loud voices burst out from where the Supreme Priest and the survivors were gathered.</p>
<p>“Saint… Saint Jayden…”</p>
<p>I ignored Basman, who was on his knees, and headed towards the Supreme Priest. I had already found the entrance to the ruins. As soon as I struck the ground with my Alpha tail, cracks formed on the ground that had been imbued with healing power. Then, clusters of white light scattered into pieces like a glass window shattering.</p>
<p>Even then, the survivors couldn’t wake from their ecstasy. The only one who freaked out was the Supreme Priest.</p>
<p>I said as I looked down at her, “Priest, tell me now. Do I look like Jayden?”</p>
<p>She began shivering and couldn’t answer. I didn’t care and continued, “I gave you gold and saved your life. You owe me a lot. Bring this to an end.”</p>
<p>Then, she squeezed out her voice in a scream, “You…you are not…a saint-!”</p>
<p>I said to her, “I heard you guys calling me the Demon King who Brings the Night.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Priest stopped shaking. Her stiff eyes didn’t even blink.</p>
<p>“Doom…”</p>
<p>I smiled slightly. “Doom Man. Yes, I am also called by that name.”</p>
<p>[You have used common power 'Gate Formation.’]</p>
<p>I set the destination of the gate as the star fortress of the association’s headquarters. Tentacles writhed as they emerged from the torn black space.</p>
<p>1. Sister to the God of the Sun. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 393</p>
<p>The atmosphere had become considerably more dreary. This was not only because I had gathered my wings and tails back, but also because Orca had appeared and extended its tentacles immediately. To be exact, they were aimed precisely at the survivors’ foreheads. The hissing sound of the air being pierced was sharp and swift.</p>
<p>“Do not kill them.”</p>
<p>I said that and glanced toward the back of Orca. Basman was in a panic, running away. One of the tentacles that had flown as if to pierce the survivors changed direction towards Basman’s back.</p>
<p>“But, a warning is necessary for the fugitives.”</p>
<p>I said to Orca, but I was looking at the Supreme Priest.</p>
<p>At that moment, Basman’s scream echoed from behind.</p>
<p>“Argh-!”</p>
<p>Basman’s face flashed into my view and disappeared.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>His body fell from the sky. I could tell a tentacle had pierced one of his shoulders, and in that brief moment, small tentacles were created on his body. The Maruka Contamination had begun.</p>
<p>Basman was frightened, but he couldn’t even think of tearing the tentacles off him. The Supreme Priest, who was a high-ranked wizard, and other survivors, including Einhell, couldn’t afford to pay attention to Basman as they were all in the same situation.</p>
<p>Right in front of their eyes, Orca’s tentacles shot towards them in warning. Then, they came to a stop right in the middle of the survivors’ foreheads, causing their eyes to fixate on the tips of the tentacles in a cross-eyed manner. Their breathless nostrils flared.</p>
<p>I announced, “Everyone’s lives are in your hands, Priest. Aside from that, you owe me a great debt.”</p>
<p>Orca made eye contact with me, then removed the tentacle that had been targeted at the Supreme Priest.</p>
<p>The Supreme Priest started fumbling her lips, but not a sound came out. She only looked around at the survivors with a heavy breath and slow movements. Her distorted face resembled that of a child about to cry, straining with anger.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for tears to flow from there. She began to nod.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The exploration team originally had over five hundred people, but now had been reduced to fewer than twenty. Most of the victims had been submerged in highly acidic poison. The stench was horrendous and the leftover gruesome scene was quite shocking, so the survivors occasionally stopped walking due to those two issues.</p>
<p>“Ralph!”</p>
<p>When one person started vomiting, the symptoms spread to the person next to them. I thought that the disgusting noise would stop once we left the area where the Grafs had appeared, but that wasn’t the case. I continued to hear people retching, and they seemed to have difficulty dealing with the tension.</p>
<p>A long time passed and the landscape changed before the sounds of vomiting finally stopped. The sun continued to hang in the sky, while the moon displayed its shape, and the immense presence of the blue planet filled the emptiness of the sky.</p>
<p>The remnants of the exploration party now reassembled slaves who were marching in unison, even though they were not physically restrained. Their slumped footsteps were heavy.</p>
<p>Soon, we arrived at a highland where we could see far into the distance. Small rocky hills sprouted up like mushrooms, spreading out below the highland. Each rocky hill resembled a tomb of a giant. It was obvious that there was an entrance to the ruins somewhere among those countless hills.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t feel anything special until then. The Supreme Priest, who was leading the group ahead, stopped as it was painful for her to guide me to the relics of the saint. The entire group naturally halted as well.</p>
<p>Orca struck the ground right beside her with its tentacles.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>The procession started again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A narrow crevice appeared between rocks. If this was the actual entrance to the ruins, then I had a hunch that it would be impossible to find without the intuition of skilled explorers.</p>
<p>One ordinary team member approached it. I pushed him to the side and looked closely into it. Even with Night Eyes activated, I couldn't see anything. I could only confirm that the rocks were making contact with each other in the distance.</p>
<p>At that moment, I felt a weird sensation for the first time. Only after I focused on the maximum Sensation that I realized the flow of Mana was not normal, even if it was very subtle.</p>
<p>This was a cover… Someone had artificially created this area to prevent something from being discovered. The object was only discernible with the naked eye at a close distance, which was why I couldn’t find it no matter how many times I tried!</p>
<p>A tingling sensation traveled up my spine. This was a presence that was much more powerful than me. Other than beings like Jayden or Doom Entegasto, who else could pull off such a camouflage? This was definitely the entrance to the ruins, and the scene visible through the gap was a captivating illusion.</p>
<p>When I put my arm in, the illusion remained the same, and the sensation of my skin burning intensified. I had felt this phenomenon before, and the Mana of outer space was highly concentrated beyond the gap between rocks.</p>
<p>The descendants of Saint Dragorin would feel immediate tranquility, but this did not apply to me. It was nothing but poison to me, with the hostility of the Old One rampant within it. That was why it felt like my skin was burning to the extent that it would directly impact my whole body…</p>
<p>I pulled my arm out and tore the rocks apart. I cleared away the rocks above that were supported by them and others that fell. After that, there was nothing left in front of me. Although the boundary wasn’t in a form that could be visibly confirmed, it was definitely right there. I decided to let the survivors who had come this far to go in first.</p>
<p>I ordered tersely, “Get in, Priest.”</p>
<p>The Supreme Priest and others didn’t understand me as they had never seen such a highly disguised form of relics before. They were confused because, despite clearing what they believed to be the entrance to the ruins, there was nothing left.</p>
<p>I pulled the priest’s arm and hurled her through the veil of disguise. Once her stumbling body passed through the veil, she vanished completely. I nodded towards Orca, and it proceeded to grab each person and toss them through the veil one by one, understanding my intent.</p>
<p>When everyone had vanished into the ruins, the spider revealed itself above the ground. Although it had only peeked its head out, as Doom Insectum had done in the ocean, it was so big that the surrounding red soil flowed down due to its movement. Also, I could feel the large spider hordes swarming beneath the ground that Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider had brought along. Orca and these were enough for our sentries.</p>
<p>I commanded Orca, “Watch carefully.”</p>
<p>I took my first step toward the relics.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>The sensation was similar to how it felt to cross the gate. A vast hall spread out before me. The expedition team members, who had been thrown by Orca, were on the cracked ground, lying down. Those who were sensitive to Mana were taken aback as they could sense that the area was saturated with it, while those who lacked such sensitivity widened their eyes in astonishment at the sudden transformation of their surroundings.</p>
<p>The first thing that caught my attention was the ancient writing that was inscribed everywhere. Even the floor I was standing on had it, and the letters were easily found on the massive pillars that were collapsed all around. They were only seen in Saint Cassian’s archives and no longer used in this alien world now.</p>
<p>Goosebumps arose on my arm as I stroked it and observed the surroundings. The ceiling was high, and there were no weapons like spears. Although there was no source of light, the inside was bright through a certain supernatural phenomenon. The walls, floors, and even the fallen pillars were so white that they reminded me of a psychiatric ward.</p>
<p>Out of nowhere, a powerful intuition swept over me, prompting me to apply pressure on the ground with my foot. The floor, which should have broken and sunk in, remained intact. No matter how much I increased my Strength, only my legs wobbled.</p>
<p>The floor looked to be made of stone, but now I knew it wasn’t. The realization struck me like a blow to the head.</p>
<p>A space that is made with materials that wouldn’t break even with the strength of an Awakened in the Ender section?</p>
<p>However, there were traces of battle as many pillars had collapsed and the floors were cracked. The fight between Doom Entegasto and Saint Jayden likely caused this. Then, I heard a groan similar to how the Supreme Priest moaned whenever she had sex with Basman.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>She was wandering around the area, and the fear that had filled her eyes had vanished already, along with her guilty conscience. She moved with a sluggish gait as if she was being dragged by an instinct, and her eyes appeared hazy, as if in pursuit of a mirage.</p>
<p>I shifted over to look toward the direction of where she was looking and noticed a huge inscription in the language of the priest association that worshiped Lacryma. The inscription was riddled with countless cracks, much like the ones on the floor, and as she looked at it, she quivered with intense emotions. Her half-open lips and unfocused gaze were the same expressions she had when she was lying in the bush with Basman.</p>
<p>The others were no different as they all seemed to have forgotten about me, filled with joy as if they had encountered a divine presence. Even Basman, who had been infected with tentacles due to Maruka Contamination, was staring blankly in happiness.</p>
<p>Only Einhell glanced at me, then approached the priest.</p>
<p>“Ms. Manolia. Ms. Manolia…”</p>
<p>After he whispered multiple times, the Supreme Priest finally made eye contact with me. Her trembling from the illusion stopped as if she remembered the reality she had momentarily forgotten.</p>
<p>However, that was it. None of them noticed what was greeting them. There was an arch-shaped tunnel that connected the hall to the corridor. As soon as I threw my body in that direction, I grabbed something and twisted it. It didn’t have a protective barrier.</p>
<p>Crack.</p>
<p>I heard the sound of bones breaking and felt warm blood flowing down my hand to my elbow. The dead body slowly revealed its true form from its hidden state.</p>
<p>As expected, it was a Graf. Despite being a bipedal creature, the monster belonged to the low-class category and wasn’t a particularly formidable original species. The corridor was swarming with these monsters. When I heightened my Sense, I could vaguely make out their shapes cluttered together.</p>
<p>All of them were in disguise. As anticipated, the relics were in possession of the Graf Clan.</p>
<p>[Devi’s Sword has been transformed into Shiva’s Sword.]</p>
<p>[You have used Devi’s Sword.]</p>
<p>A fist-sized fireball exploded in the midst of the Grafs, and their limbs flew around uncontrollably as they died and their disguises wore off. They exploded the moment Shiva’s Sword was unleashed, but the hallway remained untouched, without a single scratch. The only cracks present were those that had been there for a long time. Shiva’s Sword did not leave any damage to the surroundings.</p>
<p>I frowned and sped up. My stinging sensation was gradually turning into severe pain, so I was becoming more sensitive.</p>
<p>I personally took care of each one that had managed to evade the explosion by chance and destroyed them. The blood splattered on my face was disgusting, and it was annoying how low-class monsters were jumping into me without knowing their position.</p>
<p>I returned to the hall after removing everything in the corridor, then I saw the backs of Einhell and the others who had joined in on his escape plan.</p>
<p>You are trying to run away?</p>
<p>As soon as I sprinted to them, I grabbed the back of their heads, one in each hand. Then, I slammed them onto the floor.</p>
<p>Thump!</p>
<p>As I stood over the twitching faces of the dead, I couldn’t discern what kind of expression I had on my face. However, one thing was clear: the gazes that were directed at me were now filled with dread, with pale faces all around. Blood flowed profusely, creating pools on the floor. The sight of it caused my heart rate to accelerate, beating faster and faster.</p>
<p>Right then, I came to the realization that something was wrong as I was getting more agitated.</p>
<p>[*Storage box]</p>

<p>[Negative effect ‘Unknown’ has been removed.]</p>
<p>I knew it was effective as the pain sensation I had my skin was significantly diminished after activating that. Now only a slight itchiness bothered me. I was certain that the Old One’s Mana had greatly influenced me to an extent. I straightened my posture while scratching the back of my neck.</p>
<p>I stated coldly, “Are you actually going to run away? You have witnessed what awaits you outside.”</p>
<p>After I gave the Supreme Priest a questioning glance to clarify our location, she mentioned the term ‘altar.’ According to her, this place happened to be one of the three locations within the ‘Hall of Lacryma’ that could only be learned from Saint Cassian’s archive. She added that there was no information about the other two places.</p>
<p>“Don’t forget the…deal…” she said, but I ignored her and shifted my attention to the wizard Cereville.</p>
<p>An explosion had occurred in the corridor, and two people from the team died in the hall. Despite the commotion, he was still sitting comfortably with his eyes closed. He had three rings engraved on his heart, and now, the process of forming the fourth ring was underway as if he was weaving small chains.</p>
<p>Moreover, Basman was in a trance with a sword in his hand rather than grieving the death of his blood relative. Only the few who couldn’t handle Mana were looking at me.</p>
<p>This place was strange. The commotion caused by the battle between Doom Entegasto and Saint Jayden had created chaos, yet the Mana of the Old One was overflowing. Furthermore, the Old One’s Mana was interfering with my sensory network, making it difficult to determine the exact number and placement of the Grafs in the area.</p>
<p>Suddenly, my attention was drawn to a lifeless corpse that had been propelled in front of my foot by an explosion. The torso had been ripped apart, revealing a mana stone nestled among the cracked ribs. Typically, the mana stone would be concentrated in a black hue, but this one looked cloudy.</p>
<p>Although I had never witnessed a mana stone that had a grayish color, I could make an assumption as to why it was like this. Given the tremendous excitement that the Old One’s Mana had stirred within me, it would have undoubtedly affected the innards of any monsters present as well.</p>
<p>I observed the Supreme Priest, thinking that she might have some kind of reaction similar to those who dealt with Mana, who were all lost in their own minds right now.</p>
<p>The letters embedded on the walls, fallen debris, and pillars started to emit a radiant glow. The flow of Mana in the area began to swirl vigorously around the Supreme Priest, who had been gazing at the wall while briefing me earlier. Soon, a halo of light appeared behind her, and she began to shake uncontrollably.</p>
<p>However, that only lasted for a moment. Her arms soon stretched out straight, and her head tilted back as far as it could. Her eyes rolled up as saliva and mucus dripped down from her nose, and her tongue hung out below her mouth. Her face now had a hideous expression that didn’t match the bright sacred light behind her. Moreover, the blood vessels on her forehead were visible as they were repeatedly swelled and subsided multiple times.</p>
<p>In fact, I debated whether or not to kill her because there was clearly something powerful happening inside her. If I wasn’t going to cut her throat, then I should at least take some minimal measures…</p>
<p>Hiss-!</p>
<p>My Alpha and Gamma tails abruptly darted out, winding around each of the priest’s outstretched arms, while the remaining Beta tail coiled around her legs. I formed a wall of fire with my wings, grabbed her neck with one hand, and pushed her against the wall.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Zeus’s Thunder Spear has been removed.]</p>
<p>Odin’s Wrath was still activated. I aimed the tip of the spear, which sparked with lightning, toward her side so that I could pierce her heart.</p>
<p>I whispered in her ears while keeping the posture, “Lacryma is not here, Priest.”</p>
<p>My words triggered her, and she started resisting me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The altar was undoubtedly affecting everyone present. Basman had leapt into the Sword Expert section, while Cereville had created four rings. Nevertheless, if this was converted into the Awakened system, then they had barely progressed out of the Bsilgol section.</p>
<p>The Supreme Priest, however, was unlike the others. She resisted my tails with gritted teeth, which was reminiscent of the original Graf species that had traversed the Continent of Death. In an attempt to subdue her, I forcefully slammed her face against the wall several times, causing bright flashes of light with each impact.</p>
<p>The ground where the altar was located shook, but the priest’s face showed no signs of injury despite the repeated strikes against the wall. When I pushed her with all my strength, her face contorted against the surface. Her tongue was still lolling out of her mouth, and her eyes were blank. However, she was smiling as if she enjoyed the pain.</p>
<p>The altar and the priest made a well-matched pair. I had been keeping her alive because it was possible that there were more secrets associated with the altar, and my thoughts hadn’t changed yet. Instead, I decided to rip her smile off her face and bring her back to reality from whatever had possessed her.</p>
<p>I grabbed her face, pulled it backward, and slammed it against the wall once more. Then, I twisted the tail’s direction and hurled her to the ground. I climbed on top of her.</p>
<p>I had already thrown the spear in the air, so both of my fists were free. I maximized my Strength along with Agility.</p>
<p>Slam! Slam! Slaaaaam-!</p>
<p>With each blow, the force traveled through my fists like a spring, up toward my hips. She desperately attempted to break free with a mocking smile while exhibiting grotesque expressions. She continued to drool disgustingly, which contrasted sharply with her sacred aura. All these contradictions were coming to an end.</p>
<p>Suddenly, her face stiffened, and the swirling flow of Mana around her returned to its original state. The protective light that surrounded her vanished without a trace, and my fist stopped right in front of her face.</p>
<p>A scream finally burst out of her mouth. The resulting wind pressure had caused her skin to tear apart, causing blood to seep out from her tightly closed eyes. Her nose, which had been dripping with mucus, was already crushed.</p>
<p>She had returned to an insignificant priest, but…</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>I detected the wild flow of Mana, which I had believed had ceased, now emanating from a different source. It was from Basman. His eyes had turned blank, and his tongue was lolling out, exactly similar to how the priest had looked.</p>
<p>I gripped the spear by gathering all the lightning streaks.</p>
<p>I announced, “This is tiring.”</p>
<p>After successfully subduing both Basman and Cereville, I realized that something within the Mana had attempted to escape through their bodies. However, I didn’t give them enough time to do so before they all collapsed.</p>
<p>I moved over toward the priest while scratching the back of my neck. Her face had become distorted due to the wind pressure of my fist, and she was reciting a prayer slowly and quietly. Once she had finished praying, she pleaded for her life. I wanted to hear what had happened directly from them.</p>
<p>I stepped back and allowed her time to recover. As her prayer concluded, the overflowing Mana on the altar merged with her. Then, the light not only healed her but also Basman and Cereville. However, when the light touched me slightly, I experienced extreme discomfort, so I kept my distance.</p>
<p>After having her face completely healed, the priest stood up. I was about to ask what had happened, but she seemed to fixate on something beyond the corridor momentarily. I realized that it was the entity that had tried to escape through the exploration team members, including the priest.</p>
<p>There was only one thing for me to say to her.</p>
<p>“Lead the way, Priest.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A number of Grafs appeared, and they all possessed grayish, mutated mana stones. They were reckless in attacking me, without hesitation. However, their minds weren’t controlled by the Old One as they even tried to attack the priest. They didn’t seem to move with reasoning, except for distinguishing their kin. They were uncontrollable to the point of attacking everything in sight.</p>
<p>It dawned on me that the reason why I had not encountered the winged original Graf species was that they likely had lost their sanity upon entering this area. I found it amusing to think of Doom Insectum, who was bound to the sea, longing to enter this place.</p>
<p>Anyway, the priest had apparently discerned the path when she had been swept up by the Mana. Her footsteps illuminated the ancient letters, and new passages appeared in her direction.</p>
<p>We eventually arrived at the site where Doom Entegasto and Saint Jayden had engaged in combat. The destruction was not limited to mere cracks and collapsed pillars. The entire area had been decimated, leaving behind massive impact craters reminiscent of a meteorite strike.</p>
<p>The priest pointed ahead with an arm that shook tremendously. I sensed her feelings of guilt for committing a cardinal sin and entrusting their fate to me. As I patted her shoulder and passed by, she collapsed, covering her face with her hands.</p>
<p>“You had no choice, but to do this, Ms. Manolia.”</p>
<p>Basman’s comforting voice provided solace to her.</p>
<p>This time, my pounding heart wasn’t due to the Old One’s Mana. Excitement coursed through me as I spotted an abandoned sword in the center of the crater.</p>
<p>Approaching the sword, it suddenly emitted a red flame that appeared threatening, but it only felt like a welcoming gesture to me. There was no sign that the sword held a dangerous energy, but the sword itself hadn’t been completed. Its blade had been cut in half, and the tip of the blade was missing.</p>
<p>I grabbed the handle with my tail Alpha.</p>
<p>[Saint Jayden’s Broken Sword]</p>
<p>However, the notification message began to shake before giving me all the information.</p>
<p>[Saint Jayden’s Broken Sword]</p>
<p>As soon as a line crossed through the message…</p>
<p>[Half of the Great Red’s Heart]</p>
<p>A new message replaced the previous one.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 395</p>
<p>The fact that Saint Jayden, who had left an indelible mark on the War of New Devil, was one of the Ancient Dragons did not elicit any particular excitement from me. I waited for additional information to appear.</p>
<p>[Half of the Great Red’s Heart (Item)</p>
<p>This is half of the Great Red’s entire being, but the power and will at the time of its division are strongly embedded in the item. In this state, it is meaningless and needs purification.</p>
<p>Item Class: ?</p>
<p>Item Level: ?]</p>
<p>[* Your Power level is too low to purify this item into your own.]</p>
<p>…Wait! What is that feeling?</p>
<p>As the information window surfaced, there was a great resonance emanating from the skill and trait shell. In retrospect, there had been a similar sensation when the item name had been modified.</p>
<p>However, it had gone quiet as if nothing had happened. I tried to recollect the sensation, but it had already dissipated. I had no choice but to wait for the next time it happened.</p>
<p>I shifted my focus to the broken sword. I was not disappointed that I couldn’t utilize the half of the heart immediately. The materials that constituted the altar were destroyed and piled up in the crater. Amidst the pile of fragments, only half of the heart remained on the surface, but there would have been more inside.</p>
<p>When I touched the heart, I sensed a potent energy stirring below. I struck the ground in a swift motion using my wings, tails, and Thunder Spear after concentrating the lighting power on it.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>The altar fragments varied in size, ranging from fist-sized to house-sized. They absorbed the impact from the ground and ascended into the air in unison.</p>
<p>At that moment, massive dark objects came into view, rapidly hurtling from below to above. The energy they radiated was unique, but that wasn’t the only reason why it was easy to distinguish them from the white fragments. They were also all black.</p>
<p>I pulled out each fragment one by one with lightning streaks. As they were gathered, fragments that were in the air fell at once, but I pushed them away with a single gesture. Then, the black objects became distinct from the white background.</p>
<p>However, the object that I was looking for was nowhere to be seen. The names assigned to each black object were undoubtedly conspicuous. In addition to the Great Red, the name of Doom Entegasto directly appeared.</p>
<p>[The Third of Doom Entegasto’s Twenty-Four Ribs (Item)]</p>
<p>[The Twenty-First of Doom Entegasto’s Twenty-Four Ribs (Item)]</p>
<p>[The Seventh of Doom Entegasto’s Twenty-Four Ribs (Item)]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[The Eighteenth of Doom Entegasto’s Twenty-Four Ribs (Item)]</p>
<p>The black objects resembled giant ribs, so I didn't even need their names to identify them. Suddenly, they began to move, and all twenty-four ribs spontaneously connected, emanating a blood-red aura like a mist. Then, half of the heart that was held by my tail had a strong reaction. It seemed that the hostility from the moment they were broken or torn apart had remained within these objects.</p>
<p>Half of the heart unleashed its power, breaking free from the tail’s grip. The red flame, which had greeted me initially, rose once more, beginning to take on the form of a human figure. Doom Entegasto’s ribs also began to go through the same phenomenon, creating a human figure with crimson flame and a blood-red aura.</p>
<p>The speed at which they created shadow-like silhouettes was indeed astonishing. I had no intention of waiting for them to fully form. If they had been the real Doom Entegasto and the Great Red confronting each other, I would have left them alone, hoping they would destroy each other.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was merely a battle between parts that had been separated from their primary bodies just before they came under my control. Was I going to let them break apart on their own? No.</p>
<p>Swoosh- Zing!</p>
<p>I stabbed the spear’s tip into the hem of the blood-red aura.</p>
<p>Crackle- Whoosh!</p>
<p>Then, I repeatedly folded and unfolded my wings, striking the red flame.</p>
<p>My vision flashed, and I couldn’t see clearly. The two human figures were thrown away by the impact, but I was also bounced back. The power appeared to have invaded my wrists, wings, and even penetrated my brain. I barely managed to halt just before colliding with the wall.</p>
<p>My vision was now completely blurry, and large objects were flying toward me. I deflected the first object with the Alpha tail, and the second one with the Gamma tail. However, there were so many more pouring in that I wrapped myself in my wings. They had also been blown away previously by the unknown tremendous force, and size didn’t matter.</p>
<p>That was right. These were the countless fragments of the altar piled up on the ground. They started flying around as Doom Entegasto and the Great Red clashed. Every time they hit my wings, the impact shook my body. That was why my vision kept becoming blurry again right when it was about to be restored.</p>
<p>I couldn’t deal with the situation with Strongman. The fragments hitting me were just a side effect of the collision between the two figures.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor (God of War) has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Ra’s Sun Cape has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor (God of War) has been transformed into Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Battle).]</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Battle).]</p>
<p>[Valkyries have been summoned.]</p>
<p>It only took a moment, and I saw the back of the Valkyries. They formed a shield wall in front and on the sides, bouncing the altar fragments away as they collided with their shields.</p>
<p>Each Valkyrie was a summoned object, but it was difficult to distinguish them from humans by using their appearance alone. As they absorbed the physical impact, their back muscles moved intricately, and their short golden hair swayed along.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Far beyond the shield wall, the battle between the two figures at the edge of the giant pit was intense. It was a ferocious scene, resembling two beasts who seemed frustrated at not being able to devour each other. I could understand why everything on this altar had been destroyed.</p>
<p>The scattered debris hadn’t been formed all at once. After the fight between Doom Entegasto and the Great Red had ended, the remnants of their will from that moment kept the figures moving.</p>
<p>Battle, battle, battle! A strong desire to take the head of the remaining enemy! The Great Red had lost half of its heart, and Doom Entegasto had its ribs torn out. Both were damaged without any one side making a gain. This fight might have been…</p>
<p>A sudden thought passed through my mind that this could have been an event that wasn’t affected by the time reversal.</p>
<p>Was Doom Entegasto’s Life Vessel destroyed here?</p>
<p>If that were true, then many things would change. First of all, Saint Dragorin hadn’t been formed after the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>Saint Dragorin is the last stand for the Old One, where there is no place left for it to retreat because it is a battlefield that was created by concentrating its own power. It is thus a place where the Old One has intensely fought.</p>
<p>This was from Doom Kaos’s perspective, but from the Old One’s point of view, it could be described like this.</p>
<p>Star Dragorin must be protected at all costs. It is a primordial world with great power concentrated within, uniquely defending against Doom Kaos’s attack.</p>
<p>This also explained why Doom Kaos only revealed itself at the end of the past era. It could have been freed from the seal only after so much time had passed.</p>
<p>The same applied to the species on Saint Dragorin. They had not been created in imitation of the creations of our mainland, but like Plato’s Theory of Forms, they already existed here and cast their shadows on the earth. As my thoughts intertwined and branched out in various directions, a surprised voice caught my attention from afar.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>The Supreme Priest’s had screamed. She was far from the clash of forces. She was on one side of the corridor we had passed through, and only three survivors remained.</p>
<p>I tried to ignore her, but the feeling that followed was eerie. The sound of bubbles popping and scraping on the floor became more pronounced. There was something crawling toward the Supreme Priest, Basman, and Cereville from the opposite side.</p>
<p>The altar was huge, and the corridor ceiling was high. Nevertheless, the thing that filled the entire space, shoving its head in, had an appearance that was more than enough to freeze the three in fear. It was a monster created from the melted and merged corpses of the Grafs. Apparently, all the monsters we had killed along the way were clumped together.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t just the Graf corpses. Einhell, who died with a burst face, and another team member, who had died, were forming the monster’s head. Einhell’s body lay there horizontally, forming a gruesome upper lip, while the other dead team member's corpse was its lower lip. On both sides, the Grafs’ melted masses were attached like cheek muscles.</p>
<p>From there, a voice was squeezed out in chopped syllables.</p>
<p>“Leave. Right. Now.”</p>
<p>I was confident that I had already witnessed the most disgusting thing in the world, but even I became nauseous when facing the monster.</p>
<p>“Doom Entegasto.”</p>
<p>I pushed away the frozen Supreme Priest to the side and stepped ahead.</p>
<p>“I. Said. Leave. Right. Now.”</p>
<p>The monster didn’t take any action other than telling us to leave.</p>
<p>I didn’t end up dismantling the monster. Instead, the flow of Mana suddenly intensified, and the bodies began to fall off. As they were just masses of decayed flesh, only bubbles burst and dark fluid oozed out. It only took seconds for the entire corridor to turn into a disgusting sewer that had been abandoned for decades.</p>
<p>The liquid that flowed out from the corpses filled up to the level of my chest. I wasn’t swept away by it, but the other three drifted away while floundering.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the area where the two forces had collided was now quiet. As I moved there, a scene awaited me with the fragments of the altar piled up on the slope of a huge pit and a broken sword laid on top of them.</p>
<p>It was strikingly similar to the previous scene, as if time had been reversed. However, time hadn’t actually been reversed. The broken sword looked like it had defeated the rib bones, and it probably had always been that way.</p>
<p>[Half of the Great Red’s Heart (Item)]</p>
<p>If I touched this, then the dormant Doom Entegasto’s bones buried in the fragments of the altar would react again. Their will at the time they were shattered was too intense.</p>
<p>But what if I isolate them from each other spatially?</p>
<p>I was thinking of suppressing them with force, even if I had to activate the Man Who Overcomes Adversity.</p>
<p>As soon as I grasped the sword, it tried to challenge me by raising flames of red fire. However, it didn't shoot up with an enormous flame as if that power was meant to react only toward Doom Entegasto.</p>
<p>I felt a wriggling sensation underneath my legs from the direction where the fragments of Doom Entegasto were hidden, then I moved the sword into my storage box. The heavy weight that had been in my grip was suddenly gone.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Half of the Great Red’s Heart has been added.]</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>Now, all that remained were Doom Entegasto’s rib bones. The Absolute Battlefield crumbled, and the energy beneath my feet had become still again. The collection process was the same as before. I stroked my wings on the ground.</p>
<p>As I retrieved them, the item information window that I hadn’t seen before flashed. Similar to Half of the Great Red’s Heart, their names had been modified as well.</p>
<p>[The Fifth of Doom Entegasto’s Twenty-Four Ribs (Item)]</p>
<p>[The Fifth of Doom Entegasto’s Twenty-Four Ribs (Material)</p>
<p>This is one of the ribs that Doom Entegasto has lost. It contains the power and will at the time of its division, but it has been significantly weakened by repeated shocks. If the user combines the remaining ribs, they can form a figure of a weapon.]</p>
<p>I felt the internal movement I had felt before once again. I held my breath. Doom Entegasto’s ribs were not my immediate priority. I couldn’t miss the opportunity, so I focused and figured it out.</p>
<p>The movement that occurred when the item’s name and information changed! The movements were taking place precisely in the domain of trait Explorer and Night Eye. Moreover, even the naturally locked energy of power interfered with and dissipated.</p>
<p>Is this… supposed to be like this?</p>
<p>My previous assumptions about the origin of Saint Dragorin and the involvement of Doom Kaos in all incoming messages and windows were completely shattered. It became clear that Doom Kaos was merely using the residual system structure within me as a window.</p>
<p>While the messages contained commands from Doom Kaos, the modifications of item names and information were the result of the synergy between the trait Explorer, Night Eye, and the dormant yet latent power of their abilities.</p>
<p>Although Old One had left, the system it left behind was still operating consistently within me, with the energy of the Power acting as a lubricant…</p>
<p>As the next message appeared, I once again focused on the movement within the shell. Indeed, Explorer, Night Eye, and the energy of Power were moving together.</p>
<p>[You have collected all the materials. (Doom Entegasto’s Ribs)]</p>
<p>This message hadn’t been sent by Doom Kaos. Instead, it was something that the System structure inside me was creating on its own.</p>
<p>[Which category would you like to create?]</p>
<p>[1. Weapon 2. Armor 3. Accessory]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 396</p>
<p>A total of twelve pairs of rib bones of varying lengths were paired up, and there were two missing parts that needed to be present to connect the bones. They were the back side of the spine, known as the front sternum and spine, and the void was filled with Doom Entegasto’s red hue.</p>
<p>They were floating in the air before me, waiting for my decision.</p>
<p>Weapon? Armor? No.</p>
<p>[You have selected Accessory.]</p>
<p>[Which category would you like to create?]</p>
<p>Throughout this I had been focusing on the movement inside me after realizing that the system that Old One left behind was now optimized specifically for me.</p>
<p>[1. Ring 2. Earring 3. Necklace 4. Bracelet]</p>
<p>The system structure was similar to artificial intelligence. It was designed based on the blueprints and data that was integrated with the traits Explorer and Night Eye, and it was combined with my mental world and the energy of the Power inside me. It seemed to recognize given events and follow the overall patterns.</p>
<p>After finding the most optimized algorithm, it sent messages based on my currently available abilities. This was something that I didn’t know even when the System had undergone modification by the effect of trait Challenger.</p>
<p>Research of Mana. The work of exploring the interior and rummaging through the blueprints left by the Old One unexpectedly had resulted in a huge success. I had hit the jackpot.</p>
<p>Items could be destroyed. Even transcendent beings like Doom Entegasto and The Great Red had lost their precious belongings, but the realization that struck my mind would last forever!</p>
<p>Thump. Thump. Thump thump thump-</p>
<p>My heart pounded with strong excitement.</p>
<p>Instead of making a choice immediately, I began to imagine the options. Anklets, watches, tie pins, hand mirrors, and pendants…</p>
<p>Then, I focused.</p>
<p>[1. Ring 2. Earring 3. Necklace 4. Bracelet]</p>
<p>Finally!</p>
<p>[1. Ring 2. Earring 3. Necklace 4. Bracelet 5. Anklet 6. Watch 7. Tie Pin 8. Hand Mirror 9. Pendant 10. Epaulet]</p>
<p>The moment the number of choices increased, saliva pooled in my mouth to the point that I had to consciously swallow it.</p>
<p>[You have selected 1. Ring.]</p>
<p>My Power’s color was golden, and the hue spread before my eyes, then shot forward like an arrow. The rib bones of Doom Entegasto quickly began to shrink from the size of an adult man, and various images flashed through my mind. They were images of accessories that I had held once before, including the God of Wind’s Protective Ring, Ruler's Ring, Ring of Shadows, Attis’ Ring, The Blind's Ring, and Ring of Flames.</p>
<p>Some had two rings intersecting, while others had simple images without any decoration. No message appeared immediately, but I knew that it was demanding that I make a choice.</p>
<p>I made up my mind while imagining the twenty-four rib bones becoming links of a chain. The mental picture suddenly began to materialize before my eyes. To my surprise, the rib bones were being ripped out one by one right in front of me.</p>
<p>Cha cha chak-</p>
<p>Each rib bone formed a ring, and a total of twenty-four small rings were connected.</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere (Item)</p>
<p>It is an object of horror formed by the compression of twenty-four rib bones of Doom Entegasto. The power of Doom Entegasto is imbued within it as is the intent of the time when the ribs were broken apart. The defensive system that once protected the Life Vessel is also retained within it. It appears that purification is needed.</p>

<p>Magical Defense: 70000 / 70000]</p>
<p>[* Your Power level is too low to purify this item into your own.]</p>
<p>Level 666?</p>
<p>However, the System had noticed that the actual owner possessing the system structure was me. As soon as I questioned why all items exceeding level 481 were marked with S-class, the message disappeared.</p>
<p>[Item Class : S</p>
<p>Item Level: 666 ]</p>
<p>[Item Class: SSS</p>

<p>The item information was instantly edited, and it wasn’t just the bone ring. It applied to all my items that exceeded level 560.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>After I dismissed the modified status window, the hidden notification messages appeared.</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere (Item)]</p>
<p>[* Your Power level is too low to purify this item on your own. (Consumed Power: 500)]</p>
<p>Nevertheless, this was better than Half of the Great Red’s Heart as the power needed to purify it couldn’t even be measured.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had secured sixty Common Power when I caught Dragorin Red, and if I captured two more Dragorins, then I could fill the figure up to five hundred. Just two more…</p>
<p>Emperor Exile was the most powerful force in the vicinity, so I was planning to find out if he was one of the Dragorins.</p>
<p>I picked up the ring, and the bloody power of Doom Entegasto immediately climbed up my hand. As my golden power was completely opposite to that of the ring, I could only feel a sense of discomfort overwhelming me as we were completely incompatible. Thus, the ring had a mix of gold and blood colors intertwined haphazardly.</p>
<p>I put the ring on my finger and got out of the pit. I detected the movement of people running away, but unfortunately, they were heading in the same direction as me - the entrance of the altar.</p>
<p>I soon saw their backs, and they slowly turned their heads to me. The three people’s faces were covered in the filth of the corpse monster and were already worn out from the fatigue of the day. Therefore, they didn’t seem surprised to see me at all.</p>
<p>Not only was the monster’s disgusting fluid dripping from their faces, but their skin had also melted away, leaving their muscle and fat to drip from their faces and mix with the filth. The only intact part were their two exhausted eyes, although the decay would begin soon.</p>
<p>As I approached them, the Supreme Priest mentioned the word ‘deal.’ She wasn’t the only priest who was appointed by the Queen of Elsland, so I passed by them without responding.</p>
<p>When the exit came into my sight, I could no longer hear the footsteps of the three. Instead, I only heard the noise of bubbles bursting and boiling.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Whoosh-!</p>
<p>When crossing the boundary, I had to punch the front as the rocks were blocking the way. After the dust settled, I saw a group of dead spiders and the severed tentacles of Orca.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was the only one who could face Orca among the Awakened. In fact, when the headquarters was attacked, five people of different ethnicities had to work to inflict a single scratch on Orca, but this had been done by one being. The traces of being torn by the saw-like claws were the same in all directions.</p>
<p>It was definitely done by a Gar original species. I could envision it swinging its clawed arms. Also, I spotted its wings not too far away.</p>
<p>An unusual sensation arose from the ground, so I stamped my feet. There were supposed to be tunnels created by the spider underground, but as soon as the ground collapsed, water gushed out of the hole. It was salty, probably because it was seawater. The water pressure was so strong that it even lifted Xi Wangmu’s Spider, which had been standing underground, and then slammed it into the ground.</p>
<p>Is it because its babies are all dead?</p>
<p>Its miserable eyes followed me before it straightened its upturned body.</p>
<p>The direction in which the spider’s poisonous fangs wriggled was also the direction where a large flame had previously passed, leaving behind a trace of the spider’s fire-breathing ability. Similarly, the direction where Orca and the original species of Graf were heading was the same.</p>
<p>As the duration of my wings expired, I jumped onto the back of the spider.</p>
<p>When the coastline came into view, I saw the Orca’s back. It was kneeling toward the sea, and its head was tilted as if it was ready to be beheaded at any moment. Also, the original species of Graf appeared to be waiting for instructions while looking down at Orca.</p>
<p>First of all, the Graf was in worse shape than Orca. Not only were its wings torn, but its body was also burnt. Furthermore, the claws on both hands were drooping as if they were about to fall off immediately.</p>
<p>My gaze shifted to the tentacles that had bound Orca. The spot where it was connected to the deep sea was the center of the whirlpool, where Doom Insectum awaited me. It was peeking with only half of its face above the shoreline, just like the first time we met.</p>
<p>However, it appeared that Orca was no longer useful after my arrival. A deafening roar emanated from the surface of the sea, causing massive waves to surge and create a tsunami! The tsunami instantly crossed the coast, engulfing not only Orca but also the original Graf species.</p>
<p>Then, the second tsunami occurred. Along with the massive wave, the face of Doom Insectum approached me as it watched me from the top of the wave. All of this happened instantly after I arrived there.</p>
<p>Odin’s Wrath, which I had imbued into the spear, had subsided, and the wings and tails of flame had disappeared. However, there was still some time left for the Valkyries. In a split second, they emerged from the void and took their positions in front of the Xi Wangmu’s Spider.</p>
<p>I straightened up and was ready to throw myself at the creature.</p>
<p>However, the tsunami stopped just before it reached me! Despite the raging waves everywhere, the ones that had been coming toward me had halted.</p>
<p>Damn it. I hoped it would come at me first.</p>
<p>I taunted, “Are you afraid of me? What are you hesitating for?”</p>
<p>Doom Insectum’s eyes flickered with greed as it gazed at the bone ring on my finger. However, its eyes soon narrowed like a snake’s and shook. It wasn’t because it was thinking that it couldn’t confront and fight me. Instead, it was scared about the punishment Doom Kaos would inflict afterwards.</p>
<p>Its pupils dilated again. The waves that had been moving intensely in an up-and-down motion were finally pouring towards me. Doom Insectum must have decided that the risk was worth taking.</p>
<p>Yes, this is what I have been waiting for!</p>
<p>Upon sensing my Sixth Sense, Xi Wangmu’s spider dug into the ground and collapsed into the center before descending. There was a separate way to utilize the spider in a fight against powerful beings. While the spider went down underground, I landed on the surface.</p>
<p>Clang, clang, clang!</p>
<p>The sound of the Valkyries forming a shield wall vibrated the ground. It was then…</p>
<p>[The Almighty Doom Kaos, your owner, has gathered the monarchs for a meeting.]</p>
<p>This time, the message that appeared was pushed into my window by Doom Kaos, unrelated to the System. I could tell this because my traits, Explorer and Night Eye, weren’t the ones that were responsible for this message popping up.</p>
<p>Creek-</p>
<p>I felt the space behind me twisting. The space above the waves, where Doom Insectum’s face was, began to twist as well. Doom Insectum suddenly fell silent as if it had been enveloped in the same feeling as I was. There was no time to waste.</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>I threw the bone ring into Lee Tae-Han’s office.</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>Then, I threw Half of the Great Red’s Heart I had taken from the storage box into the guest room where Yeon-Hee was staying. When the items disappeared beyond the gate, I could feel a creepy gaze watching me from my back. It felt like the eyes would pierce not only my body but also my soul.</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>[You lack Power Resistance.]</p>
<p>The last thing I saw was Doom Insectum, bound by chains, being pulled in. The pitch-black darkness that engulfed everything unfolded before me.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 397</p>
<p>Once I activated Night Eye, the outlines of my surroundings became clear. I was on a massive staircase. The Old One’s altar was filled with white, but this place was the complete opposite, filled with a pitch-black color.</p>
<p>The space was imbued with an irresistible divine power. The tingling sensation I felt in the Old One’s altar had transformed into a pressure weighing down on my entire body.</p>
<p>Doom Caso was sitting on the lowest stair, at the very bottom, with its buttocks on the ground. As I looked down at it, I could only see its arms resting on its knees and the thick line connecting the back of its head and neck</p>
<p>When I glanced up, I saw a face staring down at me. It wasn’t very large and its face was covered in fur. Its eyes were hidden, and I could sense a hint of cold energy concentrated there. It was Doom Mount. Its ankles were bound in chains that climbed up its body, eventually vanishing into its fur.</p>
<p>As it changed its posture, the chains collided, making a noise. The fur covering its eyes swayed as well. Then, I saw its eyes clearly. They were full of hostility and wariness toward me.</p>
<p>On the stairs above, Doom Insectum was bowing its head with both its legs wrapped in golden chains. Thus, both Doom Mount and Doom Insectum were currently focused on me.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see anyone else. Each stair was distinctly separated by a hill-like height, but the top third stair, where Doom Entegasto was supposed to be standing, was covered by a curtain of darkness. All I could sense beyond it were the eyes looking down the stairs. The suffocating, creepy feelings all came from up there.</p>
<p>At that moment, a huge foot emerged through the curtain. The anklet on its ankle was similar to the bone ring I had made as it was made of entwined bones. A dragon skull was attached to the knee pad, and the entire space rang when it sat on a chair.</p>
<p>Doom Entegasto’s appearance was quite gigantic. My previous assumption of how large it was based on the rib bone that had been left in the Old One’s altar was being thrown out the window.</p>
<p>When its foot, which was large enough to crush Doom Insectum, landed beside me, I saw the fear etched on Insectum’s face and I knew I would never forget it. Doom Mount also gazed up at the massive foot. A gasp of surprise rose from the lower stairs where Doom Caso sat.</p>
<p>“P…please wait…”</p>
<p>Doom Insectum’s voice echoed, but its words were muffled by the deafening resonance of Doom Entegasto’s colossal foot descending towards the lower stairs. The right foot emerged from the curtain of darkness and stepped on the stair where Doom Mount was standing. It was going down one stair at a time.</p>
<p>This was the first time Doom Entegasto had revealed itself to the lower monarchs. As I recalled Doom Caso’s story about Doom Entegasto, I began to tremble like the other Demon Kings.</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>When its foot came down in front of me, my spine stiffened and I became breathless. However, the System was still operating regardless of how tense I felt.</p>
<p>[The Great Blue’s Skull (Material)]</p>
<p>[The Great Silver’s Skull (Material)]</p>
<p>There was no doubt that the skulls on Doom Entegasto’s knee pads were skulls of ancient dragons. I couldn’t help myself from staring at those skulls. They were quite different from the skeletal dragon I used to have. The only similarity they had was their size. Compared to the energy that was contained in the eye sockets of the two skulls, the energy inside ‘Skeletal Dragon that even the Living Worship’ was nothing.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Doom Entegasto’s gigantic form loomed over the stairs, stretching from where Caso sat to Insectum. Its feet rested before Caso, its knee before me, its abdomen before Mount, and its chest before Insectum. Also, its face was covered in helmets that were looking down at the lower-level monarchs.</p>
<p>Thud! Thud-!</p>
<p>The sound continued even though it had stopped moving, and it was coming from its heart. Its internal organs were exposed as its rib bones had been torn out. The heart, liver, and the many branching blood vessels were protected by an aura of bloody divine power.</p>
<p>Yes, I could see Doom Entegasto’s injuries through the gaps in its black armor. There were red muscles visible without any skin present, and some areas even had no muscle, revealing the skeleton.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, what caught my attention the most were the dark eye sockets of its helmet. The power emanating from it was colored a deep blood-red, making it look as if blood was spilling out from it. The energy dispersed into the surrounding area rather than being collected inside it.</p>
<p>Srrr-</p>
<p>Suddenly, it made a large motion with its arms while tilting its body. As its hand tried to grab me, my heightened Sense screamed a warning to dodge. However, avoiding its grip wasn’t the problem, the real issue was what would happen after that. This was a place where I was forced to be obedient.</p>
<p>Anyway, Doom Entegasto wouldn’t have the power to decide my life and death. I gritted my teeth, preparing for the imminent pain as Insectum’s scream echoed from the upper stairs. Doom Entegasto had prepared an opening for this meeting by punishing Insectum and me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even before Doom Entegasto grabbed me, I knew this wouldn’t be easy for me to endure. The horrifying pressure weighed down on my body.</p>
<p>Shit. Shit! Fuuuuuuck!</p>
<p>[Warning: Leave Doom Entegasto’s domain immediately.]</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell how I tolerated it. I couldn’t keep track of time as both of my eyes had burst. I lost my vision when I felt something snap in my eyeballs.</p>
<p>[You have entered a combat-disabled state.]</p>
<p>I could no longer hear the sound of my bones shattering, nor the screams of Insectum from the other side.</p>
<p>[You lack Power Resistance.]</p>
<p>[The trait the Man Who Overcame Adversity has been blocked by Doom Entegasto’s unique power ‘?’]</p>
<p>[The trait Passion has been blocked by Doom Entegasto’s unique power ‘?’]</p>
<p>[The trait Strongman has been blocked by Doom Entegasto’s unique power ‘?’]</p>
<p>The messages were distorted, resembling the flickering of an old, black-and-white television screen. My senses were numbed. Other than the overwhelming pain that coursed through me, I couldn’t feel anything. The blood that refluxed constricted my throat, making it difficult for me to breathe. I unconsciously swallowed the blood that was mixed with my fallen out teeth, and they scraped my esophagus as they went down.</p>
<p>All that remained was pain, driving me to the brink of losing my mind. Doom Entegasto was trying to kill me. My mind trembled violently as if every neuron was pulsing with a crimson light. This was the same phenomenon I had experienced when Doom Dejire and I attempted to strangle each other.</p>
<p>In the far recesses of my mind, I heard someone shrieking.</p>
<p>Aaaaaargh-!</p>
<p>It was my voice, crying out and panting in pain. The scream exploded in my head like a gun firing in my brain.</p>
<p>Just kill me. I will come back to life! Thanks to your Life Vessel-</p>
<p>I collided with something and bounced up high. Then, I was slammed down again. The force that tried to crush me suddenly disappeared, but then a burning sensation overwhelmed my entire body. It was hard for me to tell if my body was actually on fire, but the pain was horrid and it was engulfing me from my eyeballs, mouth, ears, abdomen, and limbs.</p>
<p>[The Man who Overcomes Adversity has been activated.]</p>
<p>At that moment, the message flickered and interrupted. As I blinked, a series of messages appeared immediately.</p>
<p>[Your level section has been changed. Change: Ender (Lv. 600) → Overlord (Lv. 680)]</p>
<p>[The level of your skills and proficiency level of your traits have been elevated to the next level.]</p>
<p>[All your injuries have been healed.]</p>
<p>[Gifted has been activated.]</p>
<p>[The proficiency level of all your traits has been changed. Change: → (Lv. Max)]</p>
<p>[Passion has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Due to the trait Passion Level 1 (Lv. Max), injury recovery speed has been significantly increased.]</p>
<p>What I witnessed as my wounds were healing was truly terrifying. My abdomen had ruptured, causing crushed organs to spill out, while my limbs looked like contorted branches with muscles, fat, and blood seeping from them. Also, bones jutted through the torn skin.</p>
<p>I furrowed my brow and wiped away the blood trickling from the corners of my eyes. The pain had dissipated, but the screams that had echoed the entire space still rang in my head, compelling me to surrender to Doom Entegasto.</p>
<p>I knew it would be difficult to overcome this kind of pain, but I had survived even the pain of passing through the birth canal when my mother gave birth to me. Doom Entegasto needed to show me something beyond this if it wanted to subdue me! Only if it had more to show me!</p>
<p>I took deep breaths, and as my mind calmed down, I raised my head. Fucking Doom Entegasto’s figure reappeared before me. The fist that had tried to crush me was now open, but the fist that restrained Insectum on the opposite side still possessed strength.</p>
<p>When I looked further up, I could see it looking up at the curtain of darkness. Soon after, I could also see it was still seething under its black helmet as it looked down at me. Although it was staring at me, its remaining wrath was focused on the fist that was squeezing Insectum.</p>
<p>Viscous fluid oozed between its fingers while it continued staring at me. A bloody aura burst from its fist, and my intuition struck me.</p>
<p>...Is it actually going to…?</p>
<p>It threw a mass of blood in front of me. Then…</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>[Doom Insectum has died.]</p>
<p>[Doom Mount has succeeded Doom Insectum’s position.]</p>
<p>[Doom Man has succeeded Doom Mount’s position.]</p>
<p>[Doom Caso has succeeded Doom Man’s position.]</p>
<p>Did it really just kill Insectum?</p>
<p>[Doom Lunea has succeeded Doom Caso’s position.]</p>
<p>[Your Almighty Master, Doom Kaos, has granted Doom Lunea the additional role of messenger.]</p>
<p>[Doom Lunea sends you a greeting.]</p>
<p>[Nice to meet you again~ (｡&gt;﹏&lt;｡) / ]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 398</p>
<p>Doom Entegasto’s eyes were filled with the same fury it had when it killed Insectum as it looked down at me. I could feel it glowering furiously at the back of my head for a while. Allowing it to stare at me as I lowered my head in front of it wouldn’t be enough to quell its anger. Even if it had killed Doom Insectum and given me severe pain, it was just an event in the past that was wiped away once the Man Who Overcomes Adversity had activated.</p>
<p>The opening ceremony was over. If it tried to intimidate me again, then I was planning to fight it back. I believed that since the Man Who Overcomes Adversity had been activated outside of its domain, it was an opportunity for me to assess the extent of the gap between us that had widened over time.</p>
<p>After all, I was now in the realm of immortality, not Doom Entegasto. If I got a chance later, I needed to test its true power.</p>
<p>Another message appeared.</p>
<p>[Please don’t take this the wrong way. I, Lunea, am just delivering what Doom Kaos says. Do you get it? Do you understand?]</p>
<p>However, only Caso and Mount were on the stairs below and above me. The two had just witnessed Insectum’s punishment, so they seemed to be holding their breath, trying their best not to provoke Entegasto.</p>
<p>[If you understand, then kneel down right now. Although Insectum and you both made a mistake, you have reaped all the benefits. Hurry up before Doom Entegasto’s generous heart starts wavering~ Before our master changes his mind~ Hurry up!]</p>
<p>This bastard…</p>
<p>Lunea kept sending messages as it knew it also had Doom Entegasto’s support. In addition, I couldn’t spot it anywhere.</p>
<p>Apparently, Doom Kaos wanted to wrap up the situation at this point, so I kneeled down first. In fact, I would not hesitate to kneel down repeatedly, as long as it meant that I was able to keep my recent spoils.</p>
<p>As the opportunity for me to assess Doom Entegasto’s true ability was slipping away, I silently reminded myself that this was not the appropriate place to provoke it, so I waited patiently in silence.</p>
<p>A moment later, Doom Entegasto’s agitated heartbeat began to roar louder as it climbed up the stairs. The vibrations and oppressive atmosphere it created when it came down had doubled as it went up.</p>
<p>The black armor that encased it and the decorations attached with ancient dragon bones vanished into the darkness behind the curtain…</p>
<p>Sheeeek-</p>
<p>Lunea appeared in the conference room as if it was being sucked in.</p>
<p>[Oh, gracious Doom Entegasto! I, Lunea, am so honored that I don’t know what to say. T.T Doom Man should never forget this moment.]</p>
<p>In the past, it had referred to the Guide Lumah-le as an “outdated guide who had fled its clan,” but claimed that it, Lunea, was more loyal and serious. However, that was nothing but a lie it had said that out of fear. As soon as it was appointed as ‘Doom Kaos’s messenger,’ it revealed its true nature.</p>
<p>Even Yeon-Hee couldn’t distinguish them upon first impressions. They all looked alike, and they all shared the same frivolous attitude that annoyed us.</p>
<p>[Alright, I will go up the stairs on step at a time~! ( ノ◔ω◔)ノPlease make room for me, Doom Caso!]</p>
<p>Joy was evident not only through its messages but also on its face. Mount struggled to move up a step, as its chains were holding it down. Caso looked up at me with eyes full of fear. Compared to Caso’s size, Lunea was no more than a tiny firefly. I watched as Lunea flew in front of Caso and idly wished that Caso would strike it down, but that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>As I went up to the step where Mount had previously stood, I experienced a sense of relief. If I had kept the bone ring with me, then I would not have allowed Entegasto to treat me that way.</p>
<p>I had been checking the upstairs cautiously and then quickly averted my gaze in order to not provoke Entegasto any further. Then, I lowered my head and waited quietly.</p>
<p>Despite being aware of the enlarged area inside my shell, I couldn’t concentrate on the ultimate sensation it brought. All eyes, especially Doom Entegasto’s, were fixed on me. His anger-filled gaze continued to penetrate the curtain and reach me.</p>
<p>The signs of the meeting commencing didn’t appear until a little later.</p>
<p>[First, let’s look at the battlefields first. You guys all know that our master is almighty, right? I, Lunea, swear my eternal loyalty to my master here~ ✧.ﾟ٩(๑&gt;◡&lt;๑)۶:｡♡ ]</p>
<p>I was furious that I had to read such a message even after the Stage of Advent. I should have removed it when it broke the promise, fuck…</p>
<p>Doom Kaos’s energy poured out from beyond the curtain. What came out wasn’t an image like a photograph, nor was it a physical form of Kaos’s energy. Instead, a video clip unfolded in front of me and showed dozens of battle scenes all at once-!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>#1 - Central and West of the Greenwood Continent (Land of Whirlpool)</p>
<p>Knight Lanceran widened his eyes. It was a late night on the third day of the battle against the vampire corps. A blob of blood was traversing the battlefield swiftly, and it was indistinguishable from the blood that was splattered all over the ground and scattered in puddles. Only a few people knew about its existence.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when it was revealed that the ancient vampire corps was active… In other words, when Knight Lanceran had intended to dispatch troops to the city previously controlled by Caldoran, where the vampire corps was expanding its territory… It was at this time that the altar had provided him with archives of Saint Cassian, which discussed the vampire corps.</p>
<p>In those records, there was a description of a blob of blood that moved by itself as well. It indicated the appearance of the Vampire Lord.</p>
<p>After resolving himself to face death, Knight Lanceran charged toward the blood mass. However, even if the pale vampires clinging to him weren’t there, the speed of the moving blood mass was still incredibly fast. The blood mass was heading towards the main camp, where a large number of reinforcements had joined.</p>
<p>He realized he wouldn’t be able to chase after it with his abilities, so he looked around after beheading a vampire.</p>
<p>I should join the main force.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the things that captured his immediate attention left him questioning how many soldiers would be able to retreat even if he ordered them to do so.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lanceran made eye contact with a female vampire. She was soaked in blood, but she was wearing a dress that could be seen at a social party. Apart from chasing the Vampire Lord’s blood mass, Lanceran couldn’t even stop her from smirking and jumping into him.</p>
<p>She purred, “You must have already fallen in love with my beauty, darling.”</p>
<p>That was the last voice Lanceran heard before losing consciousness.</p>
<p>#2 - Central and East of the Greenwood Continent (Barien Empire)</p>
<p>Apollo[1], William Spencer, was filled with anxiety as the progress on his side was significantly slower in comparison to Deborah Bellucci’s forces. His heart pounded with concern. The spoils of war Deborah gained by destroying the old Ronsius magic towers were considerable, and she was also leading the coalition forces closest to the imperial capital. Naturally, the one who planted the flag first became the owner.</p>
<p>The association didn’t care how the land was governed. When William heard that Deborah had immediately conscripted all adult men in the first conquered territories of the empire, he was filled with regret and self-blame.</p>
<p>Deborah was ranked the sixth strongest in the group, and he was ranked seventh. The gap between them wasn’t huge, but it was evident that Deborah was gradually widening it. What if she ended up occupying not only the high-class items from this alien land, but also from the imperial capital?</p>
<p>“I have confirmed it.”</p>
<p>It was about what kind of agreement the corps of Hera, Deborah Belluci, had made with the coalition groups.</p>
<p>“Hera had only one request for the coalition groups. She would clear the way and share everything left on that land…”</p>
<p>William understood the situation even without hearing the rest of that sentence.</p>
<p>He interrupted, “She claimed ownership of the residents in the capital of Dragorin, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Deborah Bellucci’s corps wasn’t aiming to occupy the capital. Instead, their goal was to destroy the city, plunder items and gold, then gather slave soldiers. Pillaging was the right term to use to describe what she was doing.</p>
<p>He ordered grimly, “There will be nothing left if we are late. Summon all group leaders, without exception. Right now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>#3 - Central and East of the Greenwood Continent (Barien Empire)</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat. Rat-tat-tat.</p>
<p>The sound of guns firing at the target was loud, and the mercenary Jimmy was dizzy with the smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>It was just yesterday when his group joined other groups. There seemed to be an agreement among the group’s leaders that a joint operation was necessary to capture the fortress in front of them instead of relying on individual attacks.</p>
<p>The two hundred groups had no choice but to be allied together as the Barien Empire’s firepower was on another level compared to other dukedoms. They used towers with supernatural power to form defensive lines and knew how to use flying beasts as their tactical helicopters.</p>
<p>Thus, more than two hundred groups were working together now, which meant over three thousand people had united into one corps. Jimmy was one of those mercenaries, and he was responsible for eliminating deserters coming from the frontlines.</p>
<p>It was quiet after a round of fire. Jimmy thought it was fortunate that it was night. Although the area was brightened by star shells and magic performed by the enemy's wizards, most of the gruesome scenes were quite hidden in darkness compared to the cruel starkness of daytime.</p>
<p>It was unbearably humid probably because of the blood that had been sprayed around for days. Jimmy and his fellow mercenaries took advantage of the lull to spread wood chips on the trenching ground. The corps had been formed all of a sudden, and they never imagined they would end up fighting in the trenches.</p>
<p>Jimmy unfolded a garbage box on the ground as his resting spot.</p>
<p>The biggest problem wasn’t the deserters fleeing from the frontlines of the enemy side. Instead, there were the magical spheres. They were objects that made Jimmy and the mercenaries unconsciously check the sky every now and then. They were coming from the imperial fortress, where the Awakened were attacking. When they exploded, they caused an enormous force to impact the surroundings.</p>
<p>There were rumors that people would bring in mortars later, but it wasn’t confirmed unless they were set up right in front of them.</p>
<p>Jimmy rubbed his eyes as he was quite sleepy, and talked to the mercenary beside him, “Isn’t this quite different from what we were told?”</p>
<p>“Have you not heard that the Declans were spotted?” responded the other guy.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, I mean, how can this be considered a small-scale operation?”</p>
<p>The mercenary smirked, “The Awakened must be furious that Hera’s team hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>He frowned slightly. “Deborah Bellucci.”</p>
<p>“Yes, her.”</p>
<p>The conversation stopped there as the mercenary pointed at the commotion behind their back. Jimmy turned his head back, and a small-sized team had joined the coalition. They were Asians.</p>
<p>Jimmy couldn’t make his eyes turn red like the Awakened, so he frowned and narrowed his eyes to focus his vision on them. Then, he realized why their appearance had caused such a commotion.</p>
<p>Those joining were neither Japanese nor Chinese. Instead, they were from Odin’s home country. The group’s leader had given two hundred million dollars to his ex-girlfriend’s family as she had passed away in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>“Caliber.”</p>
<p>Jimmy deliberately lowered his voice.</p>
<p>“Wow, Caliber is showing up too? Our frontline will be organized much better now.”</p>
<p>Caliber shouted in Korean as soon as he stepped in. The application on the device had more issues translating Korean than the Dragorin’s language, so the guy in front of Caliber was struggling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jimmy didn’t believe in the image that the media created of Caliber. Even though his son had portrayed him humorously in his clips and Caliber had demonstrated his faithfulness, he still held the title of the world’s sixth most powerful Awakened. The world of Awakened was not a place where anyone could climb up to that position easily.</p>
<p>Even then, Caliber’s voice was ringing loudly.</p>
<p>“Ah jik gga ji han gook mal mo r― myun uh jji ja gooo― yu gi dae jang, noo goo yu. leader. leader. leader mal lee yu.”</p>
<p>Jimmy muttered, lowering his posture into the trench, concerned that he would make eye contact with Caliber.</p>
<p>“Well, the mortar is here.”</p>
<p>He whispered as much as he could.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Indeed, Caliber quickly advanced to the front line with the speed and force of a projectile that was being launched from a mortar.</p>
<p>1. The author uses Apollon, which is the less well-known version of Apollo’s name, at least, internationally. ☜</p>

<p>Chapter 399</p>
<p>#32 ― All-source Situation Room, the World Awakened Association (Mainland)</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han was sitting in the situation room.</p>
<p>「Entrants: 33,914」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「Entrants: 33,921」</p>
<p>The speed of entering Dragorin had noticeably slowed down, which was a natural phenomenon as all the open dungeons were exhausted. He called the Director of the Office and ordered them to advance to the second opening immediately.</p>
<p>The first opening was limited only to the emperor’s direct territories, while the second opening was applied throughout the seven imperial territories. The association’s plan involved assembling teams of strong Awakened in the challenger and master sections and using them to create battlegrounds in the imperial capital. Once the enemy’s defenses were weakened, they would then launch attacks and deploy more Awakened to their territory.</p>
<p>「Entrants: 34,217」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「Entrants: 41,593」</p>
<p>The rate at which the scoreboard numbers were changing started to increase rapidly.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Not only outer space but also the real-time situation of the association’s headquarters was included. I thought that that piece of footage would be the last one, but…</p>
<p>Does Doom Kaos have thousands of eyeballs on its body?</p>
<p>Each video clip showcased a different offensive force invading various parts of the Barien Empire, like thousands of puzzle pieces. However, once combined, the full picture of the Barien Empire being consumed by the flames of war would become clear. One of the two most formidable nations was screaming and dying just like the central area of the Greenwood Continent had.</p>
<p>The last scene was an Awakened fighting the Grand Master of the empire, and the video zoomed into the Awakened’s furious red eyes.</p>
<p>[Wow~ Doom Man’s human forces are strong and burning with fighting spirit. The master is satisfied.]</p>
<p>The Man Who Overcomes Adversity had deactivated. Time had passed while I was watching all sorts of videos, so I was now fatigued.</p>
<p>[By the way, the human force has gone into override to serve their master, but what are the other corps doing? Since the human corps is leading the way, shouldn’t they be assisting and moving in response to them? I, Lunea, am honestly disappointed. Oh, not me. Doom Kaos is disappointed in you guys. Ah. Ha. Ha. Ha.]</p>
<p>Lunea kept talking incessantly, and I couldn’t tell if it was relaying Doom Kaos’s messages or simply being carried away by the thrill of becoming a Doom and was unable to stop talking.</p>
<p>However, I could understand why Doom Kaos had given such a high position to it. It was a hint that Doom Kaos would be more directly involved with us in the future. What it would have truly wanted to say was to prevent internal conflicts in advance and focus on the war that had just begun.</p>
<p>[Okay, then. Let’s chant for the last time. Eternal Loyalty to our almighty master, Doom Kaos― ٩(๑˃ꇴ˂๑)و]</p>
<p>The meeting was finally over, and I heard voices following Lunea’s words from stairs below and above me. I joined them as I didn’t mind acting like this as long as this would end the conference.</p>
<p>“Eternal Loyalty to our almighty master, Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>[Are you not going to lower your head, Doom Man?]</p>
<p>This asshole…</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I returned to the mainland as soon as I got back from the coast. The object that I sent to Yeon-Hee didn’t contain harmful energy, but the one I sent to Lee Tae-Han’s office did.</p>
<p>As I pushed open the gate and stepped into the office, I was met with a surreal sight. Lee Tae-Han’s workspace was awash in deep red energy, and all the neighboring offices on the same floor appeared to be deserted.</p>
<p>The Awakened from the association was restricting access at both ends of the corridor, then they hurriedly lowered their heads as soon as they glanced alternately between the gate that was still open and me. The bloody crimson energy had already withered up to Lee Tae-Han’s office door.</p>
<p>“Odin has returned. He is right in front of us now.”</p>
<p>As I had seen from Doom Kaos’s video, Lee Tae-Han was in the situation room, overseeing the entrance into the empire.</p>
<p>I collected the bone ring and waited for Lee Tae-Han to come over in order to briefly explain the situation to him.</p>
<p>However, Yeon-Hee arrived first. She was fully armed, ready to jump into the frontlines of the battlefield at any moment. Her anxious eyes looked at me.</p>
<p>She babbled, “I thought you were in danger.”</p>
<p>Then, she pulled out half of the ancient dragon’s heart, but the shape of it, which was originally a hilt of the broken sword, had been altered into a mundane form resembling cooled lava.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Half of the Great Red’s Heart has been added.]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere has been removed.]</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>When I was about to tell her about it, she spoke first.</p>
<p>“I was going to enter the gate if I still didn’t hear anything from you by the end of today. With Jonathan and Lee Tae-Han.”</p>
<p>I explained briefly, “There was a meeting, and all Dooms were gathered in one place.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee nodded her head while focusing on the surroundings. She appeared to be conscious of the energy of Doom Entegasto that had spread when the bone ring was left alone in the office.</p>
<p>Her gaze slowly moved to my fingers, then she frowned after noticing how my golden energy and Doom Entegasto’s bloody red energy were intertwined.</p>
<p>“It was the energy coming from that, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. “They would have taken it away if I brought that to the meeting. Doom Entegasto would have ground his teeth, waiting for the right time to kill me.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t laugh at Yeon-Hee’s serious face.</p>
<p>“Is that his stuff again?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>A knowing look appeared in her eyes. “I know what is going on. I guess you were experienced in hiding cigarettes when you were in middle school, right?”</p>
<p>She let out a laugh as if she had now relaxed.</p>
<p>The conversation then turned to the bone ring. After explaining that I needed to raise my Common Power to use this, I told her about the ‘Expansion of Life Vessel Usage Ability.’</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee showed more interest than when she learned that the bone was made from the bones of Doom Entegasto. With her eyes wide open like a surprised bunny, she was deeply immersed in the bone ring, unable to take her eyes off it.</p>
<p>I knew what she wanted. The reason why she couldn’t enter outer space immediately even though I was potentially in a dangerous situation was that she possessed my immortal vessel.</p>
<p>“Expansion of Life Vessel Usage Ability is…”</p>
<p>As expected, her voice was full of anticipation.</p>
<p>I cautioned, “Nothing has been confirmed.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were bright. “But there is a possibility that we can move the vessel. So, if we can, then…”</p>
<p>I replied instantly, “Right. If we can move the vessel, then I will consider other options.”</p>
<p>Outer space was an incredibly dangerous terrain, so I made the excuse of needing the Life Vessel to keep her tied to the mainland and prevent her from venturing into it. If she encountered the transcendents, then there was no way for someone as powerful as her to survive.</p>
<p>However, upon Yeon-Hee’s most recent visit to the auction, I realized that her demeanor was not simply one of boredom. Her calm expression seemed to indicate that the motivation driving her life was waning.</p>
<p>Besides being my lover, she was the top Awakened in the world. I knew that she was extremely proud of that, so she wouldn’t even hesitate in moving the vessel to another person. If the constraint called the Life Vessel were gone, then she would be free. Moreover, the world was noisy with the large-scale expansion of outer space entries through the Barien Empire.</p>
<p>She would have heard many things.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Just wait a bit. We will know once we catch two more Dragorins. It won’t take long.”</p>
<p>I was also hoping that the bone ring had the ability to move the vessel as much as she did. Finding a safe vault like Yeon-Hee was the next problem.</p>
<p>When Yeon-Hee regained brightness in her face, a strong presence approached the room. At first, I thought it was Lee Tae-Han, but I felt a presence from the opposite direction of the situation room, outside the building. Furthermore, based on the disappearing traces of the distorted space, I was able to confirm his identity.</p>
<p>There were only a few Awakened with returning stones. It seemed that the news of my return to the headquarters had reached Jonathan through several people’s mouths. As expected, I heard him call my name from afar. His voice echoed from outside the building and traveled through the walls.</p>
<p>- Sun!</p>
<p>It was Jonathan. He entered, dressed in a suit. All traces of his past reign on the skull throne like Doom Entegasto had been erased, and he reminded me of his previous life as a financier. He had only joined us five days ago after wandering, but I could tell that he had completely adapted to the environment.</p>
<p>It appeared that he was on his way back from meeting the club members. It would have been an event to announce his return and solidify his position as the head of the shadow government.</p>
<p>He briefly exchanged glances with Yeon-Hee, then stood in front of me.</p>
<p>“Everything is fine?”</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han came in just in time. Judging by the way their eyes flickered at each other, it was obvious that they had resolved to enter outer space starting tomorrow, as Yeon-Hee had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I finished explaining what I had already done to Yeon-Hee. Lee Tae-Han and Jonathan seemed relieved that what they had worried about hadn’t happened, but at the same time, they appeared to have gotten a better understanding of the transcendent beings.</p>
<p>Right when I was about to return to outer space, Jonathan called me. Unlike Yeon-Hee and Lee Tae-Han, his face was filled with tension. When he checked the text message on his phone, there was a creepy gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>He stated, “I think you should know about this.”</p>
<p>Jonathan showed me his screen. The headlines of the news that would be published tomorrow were written in large letters on the screen.</p>
