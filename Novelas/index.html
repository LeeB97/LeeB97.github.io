<p>Instead of hostility, his expression was now filled with questions.</p>
<p>However, this was very brief.</p>
<p>Just like the calm before a storm.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s hard to believe, but I need you. To be exact, I need you to become the Duke rather than Leo.”</p>
<p>The moment the name ‘Leo’ was said, his tension rose insurmountably once more.</p>
<p>His face, which was already ashen, turned even more white—to the point that he was almost blue.</p>
<p>His lips were trembling.</p>
<p>Only by the mention of Leo’s name.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you Duke Carter. So, walk down this path with me.”</p>
<p>Rosetta stopped speaking and let the silence stretch between them.</p>
<p>His eyes, which quivered as though there was an earthquake within him, shifted sharply to the floor.</p>
<p>“That… doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>Rather than an answer to Rosetta, it sounded like he was talking to himself. Even with bitterness filling his voice, there was a sense of helplessness.</p>
<p>Soon, his white teeth bit into his lower lip.</p>
<p>And with his lips being dry and chapped, blood was drawn.</p>
<p>A line of red blood trickled down the side of his lips.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there didn’t seem to be any sign that those white teeth would let go of his lips.</p>
<p>The gaze that fell to the ground did not look up to meet her golden irises again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the other side of this conversation, Cassion felt as though he was about to burst because his head was swirling with complicated thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Just who the hell is this woman.’</p>
<p>He felt like sh*t, but he momentarily forgot all the pain in his body because of the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>Chaos. Confusion.</p>
<p>Perhaps everything could be summed up like that.</p>
<p>Rosetta Valentine. Why was the illegitimate ducal princess of the Valentine Duchy here, doing all this for him?</p>
<p>‘Be the Duke instead of Leo?’</p>
<p>He almost laughed in vain.</p>
<p>Or, fear.</p>
<p>He had never stopped to look back just because of something like that, so he never dared to imagine it.</p>
<p>All he knew and all he wanted was survival.</p>
<p>He needed to survive. He was a man who lived only to endure.</p>
<p>But after enduring…</p>
<p>After that…</p>
<p>‘Have I ever thought of what happens after that?’</p>
<p>It felt as though there was lead weighing his chest down.</p>
<p>For him, survival was his revenge.</p>
<p>He thought it was the only thing he could do—to show them that he continued to survive despite their attempts at his life.</p>
<p>But, until when?</p>
<p>Would he end up dying after only enduring all this time?</p>
<p>‘Ah, why did this thought even come up.’</p>
<p>Amidst the confusion and misery that filled his mind, Cassion raised his head.</p>
<p>And as saw Rosetta, he almost shuddered.</p>
<p>She was so calm.</p>
<p>Even so, there was a confident look behind her eyes.</p>
<p>As a result, he couldn’t understand what it meant.</p>
<p>‘She’ll make me the Duke, she says.’</p>
<p>It was a future that he had never dared to consider, and all it took for him to think about it were her calm words.</p>
<p>It would be a future where his purpose for living was not only to ‘survive’, but a future where he could know peace and safety.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>That wasn’t possible for him.</p>
<p>‘This is definitely a trap.’</p>
<p>Cassion tried to think of it as rationally as he could.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s words were surely false. Obviously, there must be another reason.</p>
<p>‘Is she a person that Stepmother sent?’</p>
<p>Usually, other families interfered with the succession race of other families the moment the possible heirs were of the right age.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Cassion had just become an adult, and the reason for the carriage accident must be that.</p>
<p>What if Rosetta was sent here after the carriage accident just so he would be gone for good?</p>
<p>The moment he opened his mind and truly considered the position of Duke, then…</p>
<p>‘It would be enough reason to get rid of me once and for all.’</p>
<p>However, this conclusion had nothing to prove it.</p>
<p>What did the Princess of Valentine have to do with Duchess Carter? Why would she need to play this role to trap him?</p>
<p>If it was only to tempt him, it would have been better to send a member of the Carter family.</p>
<p>Not a person from a family who constantly kept the Carter Duchy in check.</p>
<p>If it was from his own family members, their sweet whispers would be all the more attractive.</p>
<p>‘Then what the hell could it be?’</p>
<p>While Cassion struggled and contemplated alone, Rosetta was still relaxed.</p>
<p>She was sitting calmly, combing through her hair as though to say ‘Take your time’.</p>
<p>Cassion continued to sort through his chaotic thoughts, uneasy with the unknown variables thrown at his face.</p>
<p>‘What the hell is her angle? Why was she trying to appease me with a ‘transaction’ that doesn’t even make sense?’</p>
<p>In fact, no matter how confident she looked, the promise of him being the head of the family could never be true.</p>
<p>Because a person who had no ability to wield magic could never be the head of the Carter Duchy.</p>
<p>The Carter family, and even the branch family.</p>
<p>They had a high-nosed pride with ‘magic’.</p>
<p>No matter how distinguished one’s background was, this family was one that recognized an individual’s capabilities first and foremost.</p>
<p>From generation to generation, the Carter Duchy’s veins had been brimming with mana, with bright talents in mana application and affinity. That’s why the successor who would become the head of the family was indisputable to all.</p>
<p>If someone as incapable as him would become Duke…</p>
<p>‘There would be a coup d’état.’</p>
<p>It would be a significant disgrace if Cassion was the one who’d succeed the Duchy.</p>
<p>There would surely be a lot of opposition.</p>
<p>Oh. Was she aiming for this?</p>
<p>The woman in front of him was the Princess of Valentine.</p>
<p>It would make sense if the Valentine Duchy would want to support him in the succession race to cause disorder within the Carter Duchy.</p>
<p>In fact, even if this wasn’t a perfect hypothesis, this was the likeliest one he could come up with.</p>
<p>After gulping once, Cassion opened his lips—resolutely.</p>
<p>“Do you plan to use me? You’ll make me Duke just so the Carter family would be a mess?”</p>
<p>Unyielding red eyes met her golden irises.</p>
<p>As their eyes met, Rosetta blinked.</p>
<p>‘What did he just say?’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 21</p>
<p>What Cassion said was quite a plausible deduction.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the best assumption he could come up with.</p>
<p>Just one problem though. It’s all wrong.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when Cassion said his family name with such a solemn tone, Rosetta felt a bit embarrassed for him.</p>
<p>It felt like she was watching someone shouting the wrong answer with a confident expression.</p>
<p>After thinking about what to say, Rosetta slowly opened her lips.</p>
<p>“It’s good to have a lot of imagination, but no—you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“Lies.”</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>As his grim tone deepened, Rosetta’s urge to roll her eyes grew.</p>
<p>However, instead of doing this, Rosetta answered once more with endless patience.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you misunderstand. Since I already said everything I needed to say, just remember that I need you. My goal is to make you the Duke of Carter. It’s up to you whether or not you take my hand—but.”</p>
<p>When her long declaration was cut off at once, the pressure that she exuded was considerable.</p>
<p>To the point where the face of the woman who had been relaxed all this time looked terribly cold.</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>Cassion was anxious as he stared at her closed red lips. When Rosetta had closed her lips, Cassion blinked vacantly. Still, he could feel tension on his back as he continued to be cautious.</p>
<p>‘Should I stop here for today?’</p>
<p>As she stared at Cassion, she thought it would be better if she wouldn’t speak more.</p>
<p>If she talked more without thinking much, this would only raise his defenses more.</p>
<p>She didn’t have to do everything in a day.</p>
<p>It’s not that she had a lot of time, but it also didn’t mean that she had no time at all for this.</p>
<p>As she concluded like this, Rosetta kept her lips closed.</p>
<p>And a curve dawned upon her lips.</p>
<p>“You’ll hear the answer tomorrow, so just rest for tonight. Come to think of it, you’re a patient, but I pushed you too hard.”</p>
<p>“What are you even…”</p>
<p>“I’ll come back when it’s bright out tomorrow. Until then, rest well and think about what I had proposed. Oh, and if you need anything, feel free to call an attendant.”</p>
<p>“Wait…”</p>
<p>“But be careful not to show your eye color when you call any employees, understand?”</p>
<p>Despite Cassion’s bewilderment, Rosetta continued to barrage him with these words.</p>
<p>At her last question, he didn’t even realize that he had nodded.</p>
<p>Satisfied with Cassion’s apparent obedience, Rosetta looked around the room one last time, then waved her hand warmly at him.</p>
<p>It was an elegant gesture, like a flower tree swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>It was very natural, the way she said it. Cassion couldn’t even protest, even until Rosetta had turned her back and went towards the door.</p>
<p>It was only after he saw her slender fingers hold the doorknob that he snapped out of it and felt that he had to hold onto her.</p>
<p>“No, just wait a second, Princess Val—ugh.”</p>
<p>He called out to her hurriedly, but his words were drowned out by a groan.</p>
<p>His body was still in a bad condition, and he suddenly felt burdened by his injuries as he groaned painfully.</p>
<p>Creeeak.</p>
<p>At the merciless sound of the door creaking open, Cassion clutched his side and raised his head.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was her fluttering hair.</p>
<p>And her face as she passed by.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked back at Cassion for a moment, not saying anything.</p>
<p>‘What a cold expression.’</p>
<p>This was his only thought.</p>
<p>“Good night.”</p>
<p>But the voice that flowed through her lips was sweet. Then soon, the door closed.</p>
<p>Rosetta had already left the room, but Cassion’s eyes were still locked on the spot where she had just been.</p>
<p>“Don’t… go.”</p>
<p>The words that he couldn’t utter earlier leaked out as though they had burst from his lips.</p>
<p>Cassion’s eyes trembled as he called out belatedly.</p>
<p>‘What am I doing right now.’</p>
<p>After being left alone, the pain seemed to come to him again.</p>
<p>And his mouth was dry.</p>
<p>He slumped and held his head with both hands for a moment, but something caught his eye.</p>
<p>‘That’s…’</p>
<p>It was the cloak that Rosetta had taken off.</p>
<p>It was a black cloak that blended perfectly with the darkness.</p>
<p>His red eyes shone sharply.</p>
<p>And they continued to glimmer as he looked out the window.</p>
<p>“Urk…”</p>
<p>Cassion clutched his side and stood up.</p>
<p>Every time he moved, his body screamed in protest, but this was bearable.</p>
<p>Because his entire life had been filled with wounds and pain that he needed to endure.</p>
<p>He limped towards the chair.</p>
<p>To be exact, it was towards the pitch-black cloak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With Rosetta’s back to the door, she heard the sound of him limping.</p>
<p>As she did, she smiled wryly.</p>
<p>‘You sure are trying hard.’</p>
<p>Without even needing to look at him, she knew that Cassion was struggling to walk.</p>
<p>She left the cloak inside the room on purpose.</p>
<p>From the moment she delayed the answer to tomorrow, she knew that Cassion was going to try and escape.</p>
<p>Rosetta was a suspicious person to him, so he would definitely try to leave the place where he was brought.</p>
<p>So if he was going to escape, Rosetta left the cloak there so he could at least hide his face.</p>
<p>‘When should I go out?’</p>
<p>Rosetta tilted her head to the side and estimated the time that had passed, and by the time the man’s footsteps had stopped, she stopped leaning on the door.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to take an evening stroll tonight.</p>
<p>‘I don’t really like playing tag.’</p>
<p>But it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>They weren’t on the same page yet, so she had to march to his beat for now.</p>
<p>Flick. With a light smile, Rosetta headed to her own room.</p>
<p>She needed to pick up another cloak since the one she had just now was with Cassion.</p>
<p>The sound of her footsteps along the hallway was quiet.</p>
<p>No, it was more than just quiet. There was no sound. Only the shadows flickered as she walked.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Although it was early summer, the night’s air was chilly.</p>
<p>The blue light of the hotel’s signboard touched the well-paved road as well.</p>
<p><strong>[ Larrington Hotel ]</strong></p>
<p>As Cassion read the sign, he grabbed the hood over his head.</p>
<p>He left the room Rosetta had given him.</p>
<p>Despite him being heavily injured, Cassion wore the cloak and escaped.</p>
<p>No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t trust the woman who told him such a ridiculous reason for saving him.</p>
<p>It’s right to think that she saved him from death…</p>
<p>But he didn’t know if he should call him his ‘savior’.</p>
<p>A maid he once trusted had poisoned his tea.</p>
<p>An attendant who was polite to him had pushed him off the stairs.</p>
<p>His own father… abandoned him.</p>
<p>He was someone who was easily swayed by kindness, but it was hard for him to accept any of it because he had to pay the price for his blind faith.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>‘Yes. It’s hard to believe, but I need you. To be exact, I need you to become the Duke rather than Leo.’</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>He went around in circles and thought about it many times, but the only conclusion he drew was that she was going to use him to bring chaos to the Carter family.</p>
<p>In the end, whatever she was planning, all he could think was that she would only use him and throw him away.</p>
<p>‘I’m sick and tired of it all.’</p>
<p>Just his stepmother and Leo were enough to send him over the edge.</p>
<p>He didn’t need to add another person in his life who’d only pin him down.</p>
<p>He was thankful that she saved him, but that was it. Since he was fine, all he had to do was go back safely and…</p>
<p>‘Go back?’</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>He laughed in vain.</p>
<p>It was miserable enough that he was on the brink of death but was resurrected back to life—but now, there was only one place where he could return to.</p>
<p>He felt lost.</p>
<p>The only place he could return to was the very place that threatened his life the most, and it was the very place that he should run away from at all costs.</p>
<p>It was like he was running endlessly on a mobius strip, going round and round without an end in sight.</p>
<p>Even as the familiar desolation greeted him, Cassion quickly pushed aside his emotions and moved his limp legs.</p>
<p>‘For now, I just need to leave.’</p>
<p>Seeing that this was a large hotel, there would be security nearby.</p>
<p>He would have to walk along the main road until he could find his way towards the shopping district.</p>
<p>Ironically, clouds began to cover the already dark night sky.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘I took the wrong turn.’</p>
<p>The man slumped down at a corner of an alley was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>Cassion took in a rough breath as he clutched his side.</p>
<p>The breaths that left his throat were hot.</p>
<p>“Search harder. He couldn’t have gotten far.”</p>
<p>“He looks like a naïve young master… Once we catch him, we’ll have to teach him a lesson.”</p>
<p>The chortling voices weren’t far away.</p>
<p>And their footsteps were coming closer.</p>
<p>They were looking for Cassion.</p>
<p>‘Sh*t.’</p>
<p>Cassion had to resist the urge to curse out loud.</p>
<p>He could only lean against a wall.</p>
<p>And crouch low on the humid floor.</p>
<p>It even felt like blood was dripping down his side even as he pressed down tightly.</p>
<p>If he encountered those people in this state, he’d be crippled for sure.</p>
<p>‘Where did it all start to go wrong?’</p>
<p>He regretted his actions, but he didn’t know where it began.</p>
<p>People suddenly started chasing after him only a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>After the blue light of the hotel sign was left behind him, Cassion walked along the main road just as he had planned.</p>
<p>He continued to limp and struggle to move, but his body quickly adapted to the pain he felt.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 22</p>
<p>Cassion’s footsteps stopped.</p>
<p>This was already the third time.</p>
<p>No matter who it was that walked near him within the span of ten steps, his heart seemed to drop to the ground, so he would naturally stop walking.</p>
<p>His anxiety stopped him from taking any more steps.</p>
<p>The planned carriage accident…</p>
<p>He was a victim who survived.</p>
<p>It was the first time that he clearly felt death, so everyone passing by him looked suspicious in his eyes.</p>
<p>He was afraid that there would be people on his trail because he disappeared from the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>Pushing the carriage he was riding off a cliff was incomparable to just pushing him off the stairs like back then.</p>
<p>That’s why he was feeling incredibly anxious that someone was chasing after him to finish the deed.</p>
<p>If he returned home safely, he might be able to save himself for a while.</p>
<p>Once Leo and his mother had done something, they usually took some time to execute their next plan.</p>
<p>Knowing that they had received help from the Valentine Duchy’s Princess this time, they would feel more complacent for the time being.</p>
<p>However, if he would meet the person who would finish him off before he arrived home…</p>
<p>‘I’ll be dead on the spot.’</p>
<p>Cassion, who had thought until this point, weighed this on his mind.</p>
<p>It felt like his heart was going to stop because it kept pounding out of his chest.</p>
<p>Fear, anger—feelings that filled him that seemed to strangle him.</p>
<p>Just hiding underneath the hood of his cloak had its limits.</p>
<p>Huu. With a deep sigh, Cassion turned to the alley without any hesitation.</p>
<p>‘Let’s give up walking by the main road.’</p>
<p>The alley that was shrouded with the ‘darkness’ that he wished for.</p>
<p>He already knew which direction he must go, so he thought that it would be better if he went down the alley where there weren’t any people.</p>
<p>If anyone looked towards that place, they would naturally think that the quiet alley without any light was leagues more dangerous.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his pounding heart was truly affected by the planned accident.</p>
<p>He was afraid of running into people, so he decided to avoid them.</p>
<p>What would be so different from playing hide-and-seek with your eyes covered?</p>
<p>And yet… Cassion belatedly realized that he had misjudged the situation.</p>
<p>He realized this when people popped out of the dark as he walked along the alleyway.</p>
<p>There were two people on the winding road.</p>
<p>They were both men, and their faces were red, seeming as though they were very drunk.</p>
<p>As he suddenly saw people on the path he needed to take, Cassion reflexively fixed the hood over his head.</p>
<p>He tried to hold his breath and blend into the shadows.</p>
<p>But just because he tried didn’t mean that he was successful.</p>
<p>The drunken men noticed Cassion.</p>
<p>He didn’t make eye contact with the men, but Cassion felt that one of them was looking at him.</p>
<p>Hiccup. The sound of the man’s hiccups echoed along the narrow alley.</p>
<p>“Huh? I’ve never seen your face before. No, wait, I can’t even see your face.”</p>
<p>Even though he was a few steps away, the stench of alcohol wafted through the man’s open mouth.</p>
<p>Cassion pretended not to hear anything and continued walking.</p>
<p>“Hey! Where are you going? You’re ignoring me?”</p>
<p>He heard the indignant voice behind him, but he continued his strides as though there was no one there.</p>
<p>And yet because he was only limping, he couldn’t move as fast as he wanted.</p>
<p>That’s why even as the drunkards were stumbling over their own feet, they were able to catch up to him in no time.</p>
<p>Tak.</p>
<p>A thick hand weighed heavily over the black cloak.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you really ignoring me? Do you know who I am, huh?!”</p>
<p>The indignant voice shouted even louder, echoing several times in that narrow alley.</p>
<p>The man, who yelled and expressed his anger, gripped Cassion’s shoulder and turned him around roughly.</p>
<p>The legs that barely kept him up faltered at once.</p>
<p>Cassion had barely managed to get this far, so he tucked face even deeper under the hood and bowed his head so that he wouldn’t be recognized.</p>
<p>‘Judging by the scent of alcohol, I don’t think they’ve been sent by Leo.’</p>
<p>Leo was a cool-headed schemer.</p>
<p>He was cruel and thorough.</p>
<p>Even if it was his own person who made a mistake, he would kick them out without hesitation. Either that, or he would severely punish them.</p>
<p>In short, it was impossible that a person who moved under his orders would drink alcohol during a mission.</p>
<p>As soon as Cassion realized that these men weren’t sent by Leo, he felt relieved.</p>
<p>Immediately after that relief, misery soon followed as he reflected on these thoughts.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the time to do that.</p>
<p>‘These men were just looking for someone to pick a fight with.’</p>
<p>There were people of this kind in any alleyway.</p>
<p>Fools who thought that the dark alleys were their territory.</p>
<p>While Cassion was lost in thought, one of the drunk men continued to talk to him.</p>
<p>“Hey. If a person has a question, ya have to answer. Right now, I’m askin’ ya if you ignored me just now.”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey. Take it easy. This kid will get scared.”</p>
<p>The man who turned Cassion around was the one who kept yelling at him, and the man next to him kept giggling.</p>
<p>“No, this punk—hiccup—he’s ignoring me—hiccup.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Cassion thought of what he could say to get out of this situation, then he opened his lips and spoke with a polite tone.</p>
<p>“I’m not ignoring you. I’m just in a bit of a hurry because there’s somewhere I have to be, so I’d appreciate it if you could let me off.”</p>
<p>If anyone saw him like this now, they would point their fingers at him while asking him where his pride as a noble went, but Cassion was a realistic rather than prideful man.</p>
<p>There was no need to get swept into a fight when his body was already so injured.</p>
<p>Since it was a matter of getting out of this situation unscathed, it was simple for him to just bow his head. His pride wouldn’t be wounded.</p>
<p>However, the two men just wouldn’t let him go easily.</p>
<p>Rather, they seemed to have gotten more incensed because of his polite tone.</p>
<p>“Haha, what’s up with that? With the way you speak, it sounds to me like you’re a noble. Why did our oh so noble blue-blooded fella come to the back alleys alone?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I know I know. Did’ja come to a place like this to find somethin’ fun? Because yer fancy banquet got a bit boring? But what should we do? If ya wanna have fun over here, it’s kinda a rule that ya gotta give money to poor people like us fellows.”</p>
<p>With a cheerful tone, his threatening hands jutted out to Cassion as if to peel off the hood over his head and reach into the pockets of a naïve, weak nobleman.</p>
<p>In a situation where he was suddenly threatened, Cassion bit his lower lip.</p>
<p>Huu.</p>
<p>The breath that came through his lips expressed his frustration.</p>
<p>‘About two people is still fine.’</p>
<p>His condition wasn’t the best, but that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t stand a chance against them. Especially since they were drunk.</p>
<p>They were right in assessing that Cassion was a mentally, physically weak nobleman.</p>
<p>As far as even his family, he was weak not just against other people.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to live on the edge of his seat every single second.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just a coincidence that he survived thus far after learning how to sense the threats that reached him.</p>
<p>“Get your hand off me.”</p>
<p>Cassion warned the man whose hand was still on his cloak.</p>
<p>“What the…”</p>
<p>The man’s words stopped there.</p>
<p>Because Cassion grabbed the man’s arm and twisted it.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>As soon as his arm was twisted, the man screamed.</p>
<p>At the unexpected turn of events, the other man looked at them blankly, flustered.</p>
<p>But tension and anger quickly tinted their drunken eyes.</p>
<p>“Hey, let go of his arm!”</p>
<p>The previously stunned man rushed in with his fist heading towards Cassion, who let go of the arm he held and evaded the fist.</p>
<p>The bear-like man couldn’t beat his speed and instead rushed into the wall.</p>
<p>With a huge bang as he collided, the man lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The man who had his arm twisted was also rolling on the floor.</p>
<p>After looking at the two men, Cassion tried to leave this place in a hurry. But.</p>
<p>“What’s that.”</p>
<p>Surprised by the loud noise, the alley was blocked by other men.</p>
<p>As if they were on the same side as the first two men, they alternately looked at the faces of the drunkards lying on the floor, then at Cassion. Then, they shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“That punk!”</p>
<p>“Catch him!”</p>
<p>People began to chase after him one after another.</p>
<p>Two were easy enough, but it was impossible for Cassion to deal with more people in his current state.</p>
<p>Cassion was forced to turn around and run.</p>
<p>It felt as though his back was going to split in half, and it felt like his legs were being twisted, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>And so, back in the present.</p>
<p>He somehow escaped them and managed to hide himself, but that was all.</p>
<p>As he sat on the cold stone floor, he stared blankly at the night sky.</p>
<p>“He ain’t here.”</p>
<p>“Look harder. He was limping, so he couldn’t have gotten far. Once he’s caught, make it so that it’s impossible for him to walk at all.”</p>
<p>He continued to hear the voices of the persistent men who searched every corner.</p>
<p>He had to hold back even his breath.</p>
<p>How long had it been? He couldn’t hear their voices anymore.</p>
<p>‘They might have given up.’</p>
<p>Thanks to the clouds covering the moon, he couldn’t guess just how long had passed.</p>
<p>Cassion silently struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>His body was stiff, so he had to hold onto the wall next to him for support.</p>
<p>However, the old walls wouldn’t withstand the weight of Cassion.</p>
<p>Rubble that fell from the wall bounced to the ground. The sound echoed.</p>
<p>‘Damn it.’</p>
<p>At the unexpected noise, Cassion forced himself even more to his feet faster, to leave this place somehow.</p>
<p>The sound of numb legs dragging across the floor could be heard.</p>
<p>And at the same time—</p>
<p>“Found ‘im.”</p>
<p>The man’s voice was louder than the sound of Cassion’s limping footsteps.</p>
<p>“Ah, sh*t.”</p>
<p>Seriously. All he could do now was laugh.</p>
<p>The threatening group of men slowly approached him. Cassion limped and took a few steps back.</p>
<p>Now, on his fifth step, Cassion’s back touched the wall behind him.</p>
<p>“Now let’s take a look at that face. How precious could that face be, huh?”</p>
<p>The man who fainted after hitting his own face against a wall smiled threateningly and prowled across the narrow alley.</p>
<p>There was no chance for Cassion to escape anymore, so he closed his eyes tightly.</p>
<p>Even if his body would become mangled, they wouldn’t be able to see the color of his eyes at all.</p>
<p>However, his resolve didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“What? After you ran away like that, you’re being harassed by these guys here?”</p>
<p>Because the familiar voice of that woman resonated in his ears.</p>
<p>His eyes widened and followed the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>Forward…</p>
<p>And, upward.</p>
<p>Underneath the hood over her head, her cascading silver hair could be seen fluttering against the wind.</p>
<p>Even in the dark, her golden eyes flashed clearly amidst her porcelain face.</p>
<p>His red lips were curled up as if amused.</p>
<p>Rosetta Valentine.</p>
<p>Sitting atop of an old building, she was strangely relaxed, an atmosphere that was out of place here.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>A beautiful voice and mesmerizing face that would captivate people and take their hearts away…</p>
<p>“This time as well, will you ask me to save you?”</p>
<p>‘Monster…’</p>
<p>Just like the one from the legends.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded and waited for Cassion’s answer.</p>
<p>She observed his stunned face after she spoke.</p>
<p>While silence stretched between the two, the men chasing after Cassion, one by one, turned their attention to Rosetta.</p>
<p>“And who the hell are ya?!”</p>
<p>“Hey, lady, you know this fella? You’re wearing a cloak, too, huh? Did you two get a matching pair? Huh? What kind of cloak is that even?”</p>
<p>The men joked amongst themselves below her.</p>
<p>“Why are you so far away? Come play with us, huh, lady?”</p>
<p>And it was unfortunate that they only spoke words that weren’t truly funny, yet they giggled even more.</p>
<p>Her golden irises coldly looked at the men, then she shifted her gaze back to Cassion.</p>
<p>It seemed like she cared about only Cassion.</p>
<p>“Answer me. I’m asking you if you want me to help you.”</p>
<p>This question proved that supposition. The men, who realized that they’d been ignored, turned red in the face.</p>
<p>“You there—you didn’t hear me?!”</p>
<p>“Come down here. Huh? You’re not coming down?!”</p>
<p>Their rough words now flooded the air.</p>
<p>Yet Rosetta’s gaze stayed on Cassion as their eyes met.</p>
<p>The man who huffed at Rosetta changed targets and turned back to Cassion.</p>
<p>“So you two know each other. What a pair you are for riling people up, huh? Okay, I got it. She’ll come down once you’re all bloody, right?”</p>
<p>As he cracked his knuckles, the large man approached Cassion.</p>
<p>When one person’s target changed, the rest followed suit and turned their attention to Cassion once more.</p>
<p>The sound of them cracking their joints filled the air.</p>
<p>Rosetta watched the situation from above, fiddling with a folding fan she brought with her.</p>
<p>Cassion hadn’t said anything yet.</p>
<p>He just looked at Rosetta without a word, then turned towards the men.</p>
<p>His eyes, covered beneath the shadow of the hood, were closed.</p>
<p>Like a prisoner waiting for his death penalty.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what the hell you’re thinking.’</p>
<p>The largest man there snatched Cassion by the collar, the man’s hand almost the size of a pot lid. He lifted his other hand.</p>
<p>It was clear that if he were to be hit by that hand, he would instantly be covered with bruises.</p>
<p>But then Rosetta herself, with her hand on the fan, gradually slowed to a flutter.</p>
<p>Then, it stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>A quiet, dry scoff rang out.</p>
<p>That’s right. She lost. What was on her lips was a smile of defeat.</p>
<p>As if it couldn’t be helped, Rosetta smiled sardonically when she stood on the rooftop.</p>
<p>“Alright. I lost.”</p>
<p>And as she rose to her feet, several pairs of eyes turned towards her.</p>
<p>Among them, Cassion’s gaze was also on her.</p>
<p>He stared at Rosetta, his closed eyes opening wide as he looked at her.</p>
<p>He looked flustered.</p>
<p>Or perhaps vexed.</p>
<p>But who cares?</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand what went on behind Cassion’s gaze.</p>
<p>Rosetta shrugged once and jumped off the roof, towards the ground.</p>
<p>Despite jumping from quite a high place, she landed lightly, just like a cat.</p>
<p>The men were speechless. And so, an inevitable silence stretched before them.</p>
<p>No one expected for her to come down from the roof in that way.</p>
<p>“From now on, I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>Rosetta’s hushed whisper resounded throughout the quiet space beneath the night sky.</p>
<p>“So don’t forget about it this time.”</p>
<p>The smile on her face was incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>Rosetta waved the fan lightly, hanging precariously by her fingertips.</p>
<p>Then, the fan opened wide with the sound of air being cut.</p>
<p>It was a sound that brought them all back to the present.</p>
<p>“What are ya… How could’ja jump off from there unscathed?”</p>
<p>“She’s human, right? Or… Is she a mage…?”</p>
<p>With the men murmuring amongst themselves, they discussed Rosetta’s identity.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to remember what golden eyes meant.</p>
<p>This was a good thing for Rosetta.</p>
<p>No, it would be better if it could stay like this forever.</p>
<p>She flapped her fan as though it was a butterfly’s wing, then approached the men.</p>
<p>She walked so gracefully, yet there was no following sound of her footsteps.</p>
<p>In no time, she appeared right under the chin of one man, who didn’t notice it.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The man who belatedly discovered Rosetta made a dumbfounded sound.</p>
<p>And when Rosetta smiled brightly, the man smiled along like a fool.</p>
<p>At that moment—</p>
<p>The man was definitely looking at Rosetta. But when he blinked, he was suddenly staring at a wall.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until he had blinked several times that he realized… the intense pain underneath his chin.</p>
<p>“Aaargh!”</p>
<p>The man rolled to the ground, holding his jaw.</p>
<p>Rosetta had taken a swing at the man’s chin.</p>
<p>‘I knew it. It hurts a little when fighting with a human’s body.’</p>
<p>When she was using this strength in the second round, she was a mix between a transcendent being who had obtained enlightenment and a normal human.</p>
<p>As she expected, there was a huge difference in using this power between a noble young lady’s body and a body that was far more superior than that of a normal human’s.</p>
<p>While Rosetta was immersed with these thoughts, the group of men who saw one man roll on the ground started rushing one by one.</p>
<p>“You think I’ll let this slide?!”</p>
<p>After she folded her fan, Rosetta hit the neck of the person standing in front of her with the same fan.</p>
<p>The man who was properly hit at his vital point collapsed without even screaming.</p>
<p>“…You, what are you?”</p>
<p>“What the… Crazy…”</p>
<p>One time could just be a coincidence, but if the number of times an incident happened reached more than two, it wouldn’t be a coincidence anymore.</p>
<p>Didn’t those two men just go down at a single blow to them each?</p>
<p>The atmosphere quickly got heavy with tension.</p>
<p>Except for Rosetta.</p>
<p>“If I were you, you should have gotten a head start instead of swearing at me.”</p>
<p>Rosetta, who gently closed her eyes, slowly faded from their sight.</p>
<p>This time, the two men who rushed from her front and back suddenly couldn’t see her.</p>
<p>Rosetta waited for the right time, then—swooped down and hit her opponent’s waist in front.</p>
<p>After the man staggered while clutching his side, Rosetta grabbed his neck of that man and pulled him towards the man behind her.</p>
<p>Tak!</p>
<p>‘Huh, so your heads are solid.’</p>
<p>One of them fell to the ground, while the other stumbled.</p>
<p>Rosetta approached the one who stumbled and slammed him into the wall.</p>
<p>Then, she turned to the man who fell to the ground and kicked his head. It wasn’t long until he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Four of them left.</p>
<p>After that, the succession of events went on similarly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Uuugh…”</p>
<p>Rosetta stood along amidst the middle of groaning men who had collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>She was a little out of breath, but that was all.</p>
<p>As she fanned her face to alleviate the heat rising in her body, she was elegant and picturesque as usual.</p>
<p>“You… Really, what are you.”</p>
<p>The same moment that the violent commotion had settled down, Cassion—the forgotten instigator of the said commotion—leaned back against a wall and spoke.</p>
<p>As he leaned back, it was clear that he was unstable on his feet.</p>
<p>Looking at his shaky legs, it seemed difficult for him just to stand.</p>
<p>‘People would think that you’re the one who fought.’</p>
<p>Rosetta thought this offhandedly, then answered with the same tone.</p>
<p>“I am Rosetta Valentine. Just how many times are you going to make me introduce myself?”</p>
<p>Cassion looked at her as though she had grown two extra heads, but he slipped to the ground with a soft groan.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>The sound of his rough breaths proved that he was at his limit.</p>
<p>His head was going around in circles, and his whole body was so hot that it felt like he was being burned alive.</p>
<p>It was getting difficult for him to ascertain whether the liquid flowing out of his waist was blood or lava.</p>
<p>And it felt like his sight was gradually blurring.</p>
<p>Rosetta observed Cassion for one moment, then approached him with a relaxed stride.</p>
<p>Cassion looked up as he sensed someone above him.</p>
<p>And he saw the sky, where clouds were beginning to subside.</p>
<p>Up until he could see a few weakly glimmering stars above.</p>
<p>His gaze on the sky gradually shifted to Rosetta, who was now right in front of him.</p>
<p>The woman’s shadow swallowed him.</p>
<p>Her cascading hair glistened in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Cassion stared quietly at Rosetta, then laughed heartily.</p>
<p>He could still see how she gracefully moved and beat up all those men.</p>
<p>“If I knew you’d be this strong, haa… I would have asked for your help right away.”</p>
<p>Rosetta narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you saying?”</p>
<p>“I mean it literally.”</p>
<p>“Then… Is that why you didn’t answer me earlier? You’re afraid I’d be weak—that I’ll get hit by these guys?”</p>
<p>“If only one person gets hurt until they’re satisfied, there’s no need to increase the number of victims for no reason.”</p>
<p>It sounded like he was stating the obvious.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s lips, which had risen faintly, gradually drew back into a straight line.</p>
<p>‘He’s this kind of person originally then. Then how did he turn into a villain?’</p>
<p>He ran away because he was suspicious of his surroundings.</p>
<p>He gasped and continued to struggle in a body that was in critical condition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he didn’t ask for help because the other person would be in danger.</p>
<p>It was laughable, this kindness.</p>
<p>Really. How could such a person be considered a villain?</p>
<p>Rosetta could remember him from the original novel.</p>
<p>An unfortunate villain who tried to use Alicia as revenge against Leo, but he eventually sympathized with Alicia.</p>
<p>A poor man whose life was threatened twice by his family after only attempting—and failing—to strangle Leo’s neck once.</p>
<p>“Is it that? The place with the biggest wound?”</p>
<p>With her fan, Rosetta pointed to Cassion’s side.</p>
<p>His eyelids, which fluttered with difficulty, opened laboriously.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She stared at Cassion silently, then reached down to pick something up without saying anything in return.</p>
<p>It was a piece of lumber with its end broken off sharply.</p>
<p>Cassion stopped breathing for a moment as he watched the woman’s movements with a blurred gaze.</p>
<p>“Right now… what are you doing.”</p>
<p>With a scratchy voice that seemed to have struggled to get out of his throat, his words trembled.</p>
<p>His hazy vision gradually became clearer.</p>
<p>Inside his head, it felt as though he had been hit with a typhoon.</p>
<p>To the point that even the boiling heat within his body subsided coldly.</p>
<p>“Now—I’m asking you what you’re doing right now.”</p>
<p>Betrayal.</p>
<p>Despite it being irrational, he felt a strange sense of betrayal rising within him.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the night air felt so cold.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the languid woman’s expression right now.</p>
<p>Or perhaps…</p>
<p>“Is this the place that hurts the most?”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the broken end of the jagged wooden plank faced him without him knowing why.</p>
<p>It was a sense of betrayal that he himself couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 24</p>
<p>Their eyes met. Hot and cold.</p>
<p>Red and gold.</p>
<p>Neither of them turned away.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared at him and moved her hand slightly sideways.</p>
<p>As though she was aiming more accurately.</p>
<p>“I gave you time to think, but you ran away. I can’t let you do that again. So choose now—will you follow me, or…”</p>
<p>Her lips stopped.</p>
<p>Inside that room a few hours ago, she had paused like this as well.</p>
<p>She would stop her words from leaving her lips and delay what was to follow.</p>
<p>That’s why he was left imagining what it could possibly be.</p>
<p>What would she say now.</p>
<p>The lips that had been closed tightly opened right then.</p>
<p>Carefully, as though a red flower was secretly blooming from a bud.</p>
<p>“Or will you just die.”</p>
<p>The flower that bloomed was poisonous.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew between them.</p>
<p>Was it because the weather had been unpredictable for a while, or was it because the alley was cold no matter how deep into the summer they were?</p>
<p>“Will you kill me?”</p>
<p>At the straightforward question, Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“I can’t let the person who heard about my plans stay alive. I’m a detail-oriented person. And I’m very careful.”</p>
<p>As she recited this, her gaze never deviated from Cassion’s eyes.</p>
<p>With tension in the air, Rosetta continued speaking as her eyelashes fluttered.</p>
<p>“But I won’t kill you with my own hands.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“If I just return you to the state you were in before and take you back to the cliffside, the person who caused that accident would come and take care of you for me.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was truly plausible considering his family.</p>
<p>If Leo or the Duchess would find out that he was still alive after the scene of the accident had been checked, they would definitely have him be finished off.</p>
<p>This carriage accident was such a good opportunity for them, far superior to when he was pushed down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>It was clear that the only result of this kind of accident would be ‘death’, unless there was someone who luckily witnessed the accident and gave him a helping hand, or if he returned home on his own.</p>
<p>After thinking this far, Cassion suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>“…But how did you know it wasn’t just an accident?”</p>
<p>The woman claimed to have nothing to do with the Duchess or Leo.</p>
<p>But wasn’t she talking too casually about this, as if she truly knew that there was a ‘criminal’ behind the ‘accident’?</p>
<p>‘How the hell does she know?’</p>
<p>One of Rosetta’s eyebrows visibly rose.</p>
<p>Against her normally calm features, this reaction was quite different.</p>
<p>“Is that important now?”</p>
<p>“It’s very important.”</p>
<p>“Will my answer help you make your decision?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’ll help.”</p>
<p>Rosetta looked into his eyes, seeing his determination, then she looked away.</p>
<p>She sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>‘Sure. I knew this would happen.’</p>
<p>Rosetta murmured to herself in resignation.</p>
<p>She had already guessed that she could be asked this question at least once.</p>
<p>In the first place, if Cassion hadn’t asked her here, she had the intention to talk about it someday in the future.</p>
<p>A seed of doubt would one day bloom into a bigger, lingering suspicion.</p>
<p>Seeds buried in one’s heart would make things go awry.</p>
<p>It would rot and fester, and everything would eventually become suspicious in his eyes.</p>
<p>But when she knew for sure that Cassion was on her side, she would have explained everything then.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s gaze headed back to Cassion.</p>
<p>Even when her gaze wasn’t on him, he continued to stare at her relentlessly.</p>
<p>Seeing his constant doubts on her, she smiled and wondered what she should answer.</p>
<p>Of course, she already had some excuses prepared in advance.</p>
<p>That she heard the carriage’s crash by chance, and when she went to investigate the loud noise, she saw that the horseman was running away.</p>
<p>That, after seeing the guilt on the horseman’s face, she guessed that it wasn’t an accident. And sure enough, she saw his body lying unconscious at the base of the cliff.</p>
<p>That, in fact, as soon as she recognized him, she thought that she should just turn a blind eye. He was another noble and he was part of one of the other three major families of the country. She supposed that it would be troublesome if she got involved in all this.</p>
<p>But she just couldn’t leave him there.</p>
<p>Because he was Cassion.</p>
<p>Because he was the eldest son of the Carter Duchy, the one who couldn’t wield magic.</p>
<p>As an illegitimate child herself, she felt a sense of solidarity with him, knowing the struggle of having other people whispering her back secretly as well.</p>
<p>And… she was lonely.</p>
<p>So she wanted him to live.</p>
<p>Perhaps because she thought he would understand how she felt.</p>
<p>However, she thought that she needed something in return since this was a huge risk for her as well.</p>
<p>That’s why she asked him to grant her ‘wish’, and he replied that he would.</p>
<p>—This was the excuse that Rosetta had prepared in advance, to explain why she noticed that it was not just a simple accident, and to explain why she asked him to grant her wish.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>‘I wonder if I should do that.’</p>
<p>As she faced Cassion now, she didn’t like the idea of giving him these excuses.</p>
<p>In the end, these were all false.</p>
<p>Would she rather make excuses?</p>
<p>Truly?</p>
<p>Did she really need to lie now?</p>
<p>If Cassion would reject her proposition, she was going to abandon him anyway.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t do anything annoying like returning him to his original state, but she’d still throw him back over the cliff.</p>
<p>Dead or alive.</p>
<p>She knew that already.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if this was the obvious choice.</p>
<p>However, it was the best choice for Rosetta.</p>
<p>Cassion was a ‘villain’.</p>
<p>It meant he had a significant role here.</p>
<p>There were no other supporting roles.</p>
<p>Wasn’t he that kind of character?</p>
<p>It was a huge risk for her to change the fate of a character who had a significant role, and for what? She wouldn’t be able to gain what she wanted.</p>
<p>And a butterfly’s wings would eventually cause a storm.</p>
<p>No one would know when that would happen.</p>
<p>If he still refused to be on her side, she had to return things to the original again, or at least to something that resembles the original.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the novel, she couldn’t lose the merit of ‘knowing the future in advance’.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s purpose now was clear: to make Alicia happy.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, even if her methods were cruel, she would do anything in her power.</p>
<p>Rather, the lack of humanity or morality at this point would only help keep her plans going.</p>
<p>If Cassion was abandoned near the scene of the accident now, it would be impossible for him to return home in his current physical condition.</p>
<p>Then, there would be two options left for him to choose.</p>
<p>Die after being discovered by Leo. Or, luckily survive just like in the novel and plot his revenge.</p>
<p>There was also the option to live somewhere else peacefully without exacting revenge, but this was unlikely.</p>
<p>The evidence was when he entered the alleyways.</p>
<p>He stopped every few steps because he was afraid of running into the people that passed by, and he was too overly conscious of his surroundings.</p>
<p>In the end, he even willingly jumped into a dark, dangerous alley on his own because he thought it was deserted.</p>
<p>Foolishly.</p>
<p>How long would he survive like this?</p>
<p>He would jump into a dark path to avoid, to hide, to escape from any visible danger.</p>
<p>He couldn’t live like that for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>And his emotions would build up every time this happened.</p>
<p>Misery. Helplessness.</p>
<p>And these would be amplified by his recent close call with death.</p>
<p>Even if it would be later than the original, Cassion would eventually turn out as the same.</p>
<p>For Cassion in the novel, ‘revenge’ was not just revenge, but it was also him struggling to live like a human being—to survive until the bitter end.</p>
<p>From now on, his mode of survival wouldn’t just be to endure.</p>
<p>Either he dies, or they die. He would have to choose.</p>
<p>And if it would end like the original, unfortunately…</p>
<p>‘He would die sooner or later.’</p>
<p>What reason did she have to hide the truth from a man who would eventually die because he wouldn’t side with her?</p>
<p>Her conflicting thoughts concluded like that.</p>
<p>In a way, this was an impulsive and dangerous choice, but Rosetta wanted to win over this man, even if it meant that she would have to take a risk.</p>
<p>Rather than forcibly pulling a leash to keep him controlled, it might be better to guide him by holding his hand and letting him walk on his own.</p>
<p>“Before…”</p>
<p>Her previously tightly shut lips opened slowly. Cassion’s clouded eyes shone sharply amid the tension.</p>
<p>“Before I tell you, you must keep a promise.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Believe everything I say. Even if it’s unbelievable.”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer right away. His persistent gaze still faced her, but that was all.</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>It was a provocation towards him for him to answer quicker.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cassion agonized over his choice.</p>
<p>Because he wouldn’t be able to take back what was already said.</p>
<p>If he answered that he wouldn’t believe her, then her lips would close forever. But if he said he would believe her, then he really would have to.</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt a sharp pain at his side. He blocked it with his hands, but his vision blurred as his head spun.</p>
<p>“Limit…”</p>
<p>He was at his limit.</p>
<p>He didn’t have time to think anymore. His eyes would close at this rate.</p>
<p>And once he woke up…</p>
<p>No. He might not even wake up anymore.</p>
<p>The woman, who showed not an ounce of mercy, did not move.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was the kind of person who could turn her back on him without hesitation even now.</p>
<p>Cassion gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>And at that, he gripped the wooden plank that Rosetta was holding.</p>
<p>Haa. With a groan as though his own soul would seep out of his lips, Cassion nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll believe you.”</p>
<p>He knew that his only real option left was to follow Rosetta, so he replied as such.</p>
<p>Even at this moment when he was on the brink of death once again, he still didn’t want to die by another person’s hand.</p>
<p>Yet if he was going to be by her side, then he would willingly hold her hand.</p>
<p>Rosetta calmly looked at the dying man, then she opened her lips.</p>
<p>“My nanny had abused me and my sister, Alicia, for a long time. One day while she was ‘lecturing’ us, I fainted… And suddenly, I learned something.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The truth is…”</p>
<p>He could barely hear her staggering words as he blinked his eyes.</p>
<p>Shhwaaa.</p>
<p>Instead of the woman’s voice, what he heard more clearly were the trees that swayed in the wind.</p>
<p>The hand that the woman used to hold the lumber was now in the air, and in turn, the man who held the jagged plank fell helplessly to his side.</p>
<p>Looking at his fingertips, Rosetta continued to talk.</p>
<p>“In the near future, my lovely sister Alicia… I found out that your lunatic younger brother Leo will make her suffer. And…”</p>
<p>The tone she spoke with was cold.</p>
<p>Actually, she spoke faster than usual as though she was in a hurry, but her tone was as dry as before.</p>
<p>This created an eerie feeling.</p>
<p>The nonsense she was spouting almost sounded true.</p>
<p>Even she knew that it was ridiculous, so it couldn’t easily be considered the truth.</p>
<p>“Both you and I. I learned the fact that we will both eventually die. That’s everything I found out.”</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>A smile dawned over someone’s lips.</p>
<p>The two of them.</p>
<p>The speaker and the listener.</p>
<p>Rosetta and Cassion.</p>
<p>Neither knew who it belonged to, this powerless smile.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 25</p>
<p>“Sorry but, I find what you’re saying hard to believe right now. It’s such an absurd story…”</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded after hearing his honest thoughts.</p>
<p>In fact, she also knew that people wouldn’t easily believe this.</p>
<p>It was better that he honestly said that he couldn’t wrap his head around it.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>‘It’s much better than going with the flow now and hitting me on the back of my head later.’</p>
<p>While Rosetta positively assessed Cassion’s distrust, the man exhaled with a shaky breath.</p>
<p>He covered his lips, but he felt his own scorching breath.</p>
<p>He looked down at his bloody side, then looked up once more to match his gaze with Rosetta.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the time to smile, but he did.</p>
<p>And as he smiled silently, his red eyes suddenly felt heavy.</p>
<p>A hot sensation pressed over his eyes. The heat weighed down his eyes, and eventually became tears that trickled down.</p>
<p>Yet the tears themselves were as cold as ice.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared blankly at Cassion.</p>
<p>One second he said that he couldn’t believe her words, then the next he was suddenly crying.</p>
<p>And he cried coldly, as though he was the winter night himself.</p>
<p>“Hu… ugh…”</p>
<p>What seeped out of his lips were sounds that couldn’t be identified, whether they were sobs or laughter.</p>
<p>Despite that, his lips that were curved up looked sorrowful.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying.”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s not-so-delicate question, Cassion opened his eyes.</p>
<p>More tears streamed down his cheeks as he slowly opened his eyelids.</p>
<p>“Because I’m sad.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s an absurd story, because eventually, it’s making me want to just die.”</p>
<p>An unbelievable explanation. An explanation without any evidence presented.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the connotation of a dog’s death, a meaningless death, hung in the air.</p>
<p>‘Dog’s death.’</p>
<p>Was it because this pitiful, miserable description suited him so well?</p>
<p>Was it because he had always thought that when he was going to die someday, it would be a meaningless death?</p>
<p>“You knew in advance that I would be in an accident, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I saw it in advance, that’s why I was there to save you while you were on the verge of dying. I planned to save you and ask you to join hands with me so that we could escape that fate together.”</p>
<p>But what she didn’t plan was that he would forget about her rescuing him.</p>
<p>Listening to Rosetta’s added explanation, Cassion nodded.</p>
<p>If all those absurd words were true, then the absurd probability could be understood.</p>
<p>He knew now how Rosetta knew about the carriage ‘accident’.</p>
<p>So when she saved him…</p>
<p>And when she suddenly told him to become the next duke instead of Leo…</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do now?”</p>
<p>Rosetta asked Cassion with a hushed voice. He was lost in thought.</p>
<p>“I said everything I could say. But if you’re still thinking about it…”</p>
<p>She stopped talking for a while, then she raised her hand and uncurled her fingers one by one.</p>
<p>Index finger, middle finger, and ring finger.</p>
<p>As she held up three fingers, a solemn voice came out from Rosetta’s lips.</p>
<p>“One, I will do my best to help you, Cassion Carter, while you’re on my side, and I will never abandon you. Two, I will make sure that you can survive and become happy at the end of it all. And three, if I ever break this oath, I vow that I shall die the cruelest, most miserable death in the world, and that I will remove myself from everyone’s memories.”</p>
<p>This vicious oath resounded throughout the dark alley.</p>
<p>And as she stopped speaking, she slowly turned her eyes towards the man.</p>
<p>“What a brutal vow.”</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be like that if you want it to be upheld. Even if it’s uncomfortable to hear.”</p>
<p>At the man’s words which were tinted with amusement, Rosetta also replied with a similar tone of voice.</p>
<p>The fingers she had folded as she counted were held up again.</p>
<p>“Now, it’s your turn to choose.”</p>
<p>She had already laid everything she could in front of him. All that was left was Cassion’s choice.</p>
<p>“Will you die as fate decrees, or…”</p>
<p>Survive. With her.</p>
<p>Rosetta reached out to the man. It was the same hand that had been wounded by glass shards, still bandaged now—the same hand that held up three fingers to signify her vow.</p>
<p>The white bandage was stained with both blood and rubble.</p>
<p>The blood of the man she saved, the rubble that she grazed to save him.</p>
<p>Cassion stared at Rosetta’s hand. Then, his gasping voice rang clearly.</p>
<p>“I trust you…”</p>
<p>Soon after, he stopped leaning back on the wall.</p>
<p>But his head, as it lost the place where it leaned on, faltered dangerously forward.</p>
<p>Like a flower swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>“Since I said I’ll trust you… Even if it’s unbelievable, I’ll trust you. So after all this, if what you say is true…”</p>
<p>Rosetta stared wordlessly as his black hair fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>“Heuk…”</p>
<p>With a groan, his shoulders shook and sank down.</p>
<p>But even before he crouched down, a series of biting coughs came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>And red blood flowed down the corner of his lips and wet his chin.</p>
<p>He steeled his gaze.</p>
<p>He was already losing consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, he couldn’t even feel the pain anymore.</p>
<p>Cassion squeezed out his last remaining strength and lifted his head slightly.</p>
<p>But his gaze lost its grip as his staggering body barely reached Roseta.</p>
<p>“I accept your proposition.”</p>
<p>His quivering red eyes flashed with madness.</p>
<p>“Rosetta Valentine. I don’t know how you’re going to make me the next Duke, but… Alright… Save me. Make me the next Duke.”</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>The face that was wet with both blood and tears smiled broadly.</p>
<p>And he leaned down towards the hand that reached out towards him, his cheek on her palm.</p>
<p>He couldn’t move his hands because he was using them to prop himself up, holding onto the wall behind him.</p>
<p>That’s right. This was his best option.</p>
<p>Her palm was wet.</p>
<p>Not knowing whether it was blood or tears, Rosetta continued to stay silent.</p>
<p>Soon, however, she could feel the face in her palm move slowly.</p>
<p>Even this stiff expression trembled.</p>
<p>“Even so, if I still die no matter what… I just want to continue enduring.”</p>
<p>Anger. Sadness. Misery. Despair.</p>
<p>And hope.</p>
<p>His voice was tinged with several different emotions.</p>
<p>“Save me.”</p>
<p>Where desperate words and confessions were laid bare, the air was now filled with silence.</p>
<p>Devoid of either his breath or the beating of his heart.</p>
<p>“…Cassion?”</p>
<p>Rosetta called out to him, a heavy foreboding weighing on her shoulders.</p>
<p>She couldn’t feel any movement on her palm.</p>
<p>She couldn’t feel even his staggered breaths.</p>
<p>As her hand grew cold over his skin, the novel’s contents flashed through mind.</p>
<p>「 He collapsed to the ground underneath the red, burning sunset, but when he hurriedly opened his eyes, the cold evening air hit his body.</p>
<p>He could see the night sky, where clouds peacefully floated by. The moon, which was covered by the clouds, slowly revealed itself.</p>
<p>His body temperature rapidly dropped as his clothes were soaked with his own blood.</p>
<p>The darkness that quickly followed the dangerous night made his throat clench.</p>
<p>“Urgh…”</p>
<p>With a pained groan, his bright red eyes finally lost their light. His breath stopped and no longer passed through his throat.</p>
<p>Like a blank sheet, his cold body lay motionless.</p>
<p>And thus, Cassion’s heart stopped. 」</p>
<p>‘No way.’</p>
<p>As Rosetta recalled the original scene, she urgently collapsed in front of him.</p>
<p>The cold body slid down as she moved.</p>
<p>“Cassion! Cassion!”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes wouldn’t open even as she called him desperately.</p>
<p>His face grew paler and paler.</p>
<p>‘No. This is fine.’</p>
<p>It turned out great.</p>
<p>Yes. His heart simply stopped here.</p>
<p>Although the time and location changed a little, it was still the same day of the accident.</p>
<p>Around this time, the heart of Cassion in the novel had also stopped beating, so in a little while, his heart should also start back up again.</p>
<p>Just like the original.</p>
<p>From the start, a mage’s source of mana was their heart.</p>
<p>They used the mana that flowed through their heart to conjure magic, and a mage’s ability was determined by their mana affinity and prowess with mana application.</p>
<p>Therefore, a mage needed both effort and natural talent.</p>
<p>Since the condition was to have both mana that flowed through one’s body and the ability to control this through mana application, if one or the other couldn’t be achieved, then the result would arrive at zero. If one wasn’t born with mana affinity, then they wouldn’t be able to become a mage.</p>
<p>But here, Cassion couldn’t comply with the requirement of ‘mana application’.</p>
<p>There was mana in his body, but he couldn’t use it because it didn’t flow well through him.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t born with the natural talent to control this, he couldn’t become a mage.</p>
<p>But this was half right and half wrong.</p>
<p>It was true that Cassion’s mana was trapped in his heart.</p>
<p>It was also true that his mana couldn’t flow through his bloodstream because there was something blocking the pathways.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t true that he lacked the ability to control his mana.</p>
<p>‘The fact is that his mana has just been blocked.’</p>
<p>That’s the only thing.</p>
<p>With regard to mana application and mana affinity, he was the purest sense of ‘natural talent’.</p>
<p>He was a genius that was born only once in a thousand years.</p>
<p>With his mana blocked, no one noticed his talents.</p>
<p>No matter how much of a genius he was, if he was never given a chance to explore his talents, then he wouldn’t be able to live up to his potential.</p>
<p>Just as when one wouldn’t know if they could kick well until they actually kicked a ball.</p>
<p>Cassion had never been given a ball, let alone a chance to kick one.</p>
<p>And in the original work, when his heart stopped, this served as a trigger for him to be able to receive that ‘ball’.</p>
<p>What gave him the power to become a villain was this revival.</p>
<p>His heart had now cooled and stopped moving.</p>
<p>Rosetta once again recalled the original text.</p>
<p>「 It hadn’t been long since Cassion’s heart stopped.</p>
<p>Mana began to flow through it instead of blood, trickling in endlessly.</p>
<p>It was something of a ‘defense mechanism’.</p>
<p>In order to save the dying body, the heart began to supply the mana trapped within it instead of blood.</p>
<p>It was a miracle.</p>
<p>A marvelous phenomenon that his mana was flowing.</p>
<p>Truthfully, this alone was not enough to save his dying body.</p>
<p>The amount of mana that began to seep was like only a thin stream of water.</p>
<p>However, as a result, Cassion’s heart began to beat once more.</p>
<p>His ‘mana application’—that he or anyone else never knew about—was on the level of a genius.</p>
<p>As the shallow mana began to trickle, his overwhelming talent began to flood.</p>
<p>His body became warm again. And he could breathe once more.</p>
<p>His stiffened fingers were spread out, and his leaking blood slowly stopped.</p>
<p>And finally.</p>
<p>His heart, which had stopped beating, began to pound loudly.</p>
<p>Boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>“Heuuk.”</p>
<p>The breath he took in was ragged and pained, just like the one he breathed out as he died just moments ago.</p>
<p>Cassion opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The world was still dark, yet the stars blanketing the night sky glimmered fiercely.</p>
<p>He could tell without ascertaining it.</p>
<p>This strange sensation that now flowed through his body.</p>
<p>After being abandoned by everyone—after being abandoned by the world—he finally became a Carter who could wield magic. 」</p>
<p>That’s right. According to the novel, he should soon open his eyes and realize his own abilities.</p>
<p>Although the mana flowing through his streams was unstable, he would become a formidable mage because of his remarkable mana application…</p>
<p>She was confident that this would be solved.</p>
<p>So, Cassion just needed to open his eyes…</p>
<p>“You can open your eyes now.”</p>
<p>Rosetta bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 26</p>
<p>Because of how hard she bit down on her lower lip, blood profusely seeped out of the wound.</p>
<p>Feeling nervous like this wasn’t like her, but it was because of this ‘uncertainty.’</p>
<p>It was ironic, but she wasn’t sure if Cassion would open his eyes.</p>
<p>Since the time she brought him in, Cassion’s part in the novel had already been altered.</p>
<p>Because of this, all the parts related to ‘Cassion’ in the novel would be nothing short of uncertain prophecy.</p>
<p>When it came to simple plotlines, even if it was an uncertain prophecy, she thought that it would be fine even if she helped him, but…</p>
<p>This… this was a matter of life.</p>
<p>What if he wouldn’t open his eyes just like in the novel and instead he would take his last breath here?</p>
<p>Save me.’</p>
<p>The hushed voice that fell short as tears fell over a brilliant smile. The desperate voice seemed to overlap with the face of the man even as his eyes were closed.</p>
<p>It was a short-lived hallucination to appease her worries.</p>
<p>Rosetta carefully laid Cassion’s body on the floor.</p>
<p>‘Alright. Even if your mana doesn’t flow this time… Let’s just try to save you and think about that again later.’</p>
<p>Once he came back to life, there would be a way.</p>
<p>The fact that mana was trapped in his heart and the fact that Cassion had enormous mana application—these remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were many ways to make him a ‘mage’ even if there were a couple of setbacks.</p>
<p>She pressed over the smooth, pale bridge of his nose and lifted the man’s chin.</p>
<p>The slightly open lips had already lost their color, but the teeth inside the mouth were white and the tongue was too red.</p>
<p>“Haa.”</p>
<p>‘I can’t believe I’ll be using the CPR lessons I had back in middle school in this kind of place.’</p>
<p>Rosetta, who breathed in, slowly leaned over the man’s face.</p>
<p>The distance between them grew closer. The cold temperature of a body with a halted heart could be felt near her face.</p>
<p>Rosetta paused for a while, but continued leaning down once more.</p>
<p>Finally, their open lips locked.</p>
<p>It was her first time to breathe life into someone, so I felt strange.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rosetta did not know. Right after her lips touched.</p>
<p>The fact that the man’s heart has already begun to beat again.</p>
<p>And at that moment, his eyelashes that had been tightly closed, fluttered open for a moment. At which, the red eyes briefly showed awareness, but then faded into unconsciousness once more.</p>
<p>Warmth slowly returned to the cooled lips.</p>
<p>Those warm lips were both lukewarm, yet scorching.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Deep into the night, inside a room where Cassion was also staying in.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t found you then, what would you have done? I know that a lot of suspicious people come to our hotel, but… It’s not easy to come in with someone bleeding so much like that.”</p>
<p>Placing Cassion back on the bed, Rosetta turned towards the sound of laughter that she heard from the other side of the room.</p>
<p>A woman leaning against an empty table, hiding her face under a blue veil, waved her hand toward Rosetta.</p>
<p>And they made eye contact.</p>
<p>Smiling lightly, Rosetta while correcting Cassion’s posture.</p>
<p>“I’m aware. It would have been a disaster if you hadn’t found us. It’s fortunate that you appeared as soon as I got near the hotel as if you had been surveilling us.”</p>
<p>“It’s really just a coincidence. There must really be such a thing like fate in the world. For example, the Princess and I are on the same page.”</p>
<p>The voice that responded was very shameless.</p>
<p>The gesture of the woman touching her chest as if she had nothing to hide was also exaggerated.</p>
<p>Rosetta was at a loss for words as she shook her head.</p>
<p>Right. Whether someone would throw a rope to a person who’s drowning, or should it be something as useless as underwear or a rubber band, it was up to the rescuer.</p>
<p>Anyway, wasn’t the important thing here the fact that she was ‘saved’?</p>
<p>It’s true that Blanca’s sudden appearance seemed very coincidental, but as a result, Rosetta was able to receive her help.</p>
<p>So she chose not to say anything more.</p>
<p>A few moments ago.</p>
<p>While Cassion was unconscious, she gave him CPR.</p>
<p>While breathing life into him, Rosetta realized at some point that his pulse had returned.</p>
<p>When she touched his pale face, she felt a weak sense of warmth beneath her touch even though his body was still as cold as a corpse’s.</p>
<p>“You’re alive.”</p>
<p>After a short sigh of relief, Rosetta picked him up and headed back to the hotel.</p>
<p>She also didn’t forget to fasten his cloak tightly so that his face and wounds wouldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>Although his unnecessarily long legs kept getting tangled, they were able to arrive at the hotel shortly after.</p>
<p>The question was how they would go in.</p>
<p>If they’re going in with their cloaks on, no matter who saw it, it was suspicious…</p>
<p>‘It would be suspicious for a man and a woman to enter the main doors like this so openly.’</p>
<p>And apart from that, since she was carrying the clearly collapsed man over her back like this, it was all the more suspicious.</p>
<p>Employees with lids over their mouths would pretend not to see it, but customers with curious eyes and flapping lips would blow this out of proportion.</p>
<p>Those who had a lot of money had rather cheap hobbies.</p>
<p>While she was mulling over where to hide Cassion while she would go in to ask help from an employee, someone approached her.</p>
<p>”Princess.”</p>
<p>A familiar whisper called to her.</p>
<p>She blinked and turned around, towards the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>However, she could see not even an anthill from where she was standing against the hotel’s outer wall.</p>
<p>She could feel a weak presence, but that was all.</p>
<p>”Blanca?”</p>
<p>Rosetta called the name in a small voice, but there was still no one who appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>‘Am I being haunted by a ghost?’</p>
<p>Suddenly? A ghost?</p>
<p>The corners of her lips tugged up at the ridiculous thought.</p>
<p>It was so funny even to Rosetta.</p>
<p>But then at that moment—</p>
<p>One part of the hotel’s outer wall began to open.</p>
<p>‘What is it this time.’</p>
<p>It was obviously a hidden door that would lead to a secret space.</p>
<p>And there was only one person who’d install something like that in the hotel.</p>
<p>The owner of the hotel herself.</p>
<p>Madam Blanca.</p>
<p>As expected, it was Madam Blanca who appeared through the door.</p>
<p>The owner of the hotel continued to cover her face with a blue veil.</p>
<p>”Over here, Princess.”</p>
<p>Blanca beckoned Rosetta with one hand as she held the door open, the gesture expressing something like Blanca’s secretive yet playful attitude.</p>
<p>Rosetta thought for a while about what she should do, but she didn’t need long.</p>
<p>It was a little dubious how the secret door opened here the moment she worried about how to enter the hotel, but there was no reason not to follow the owner.</p>
<p>Anyway, with Blanca’s help, Rosetta and Cassion arrived at her room on the fifth floor of the hotel.</p>
<p>They entered the fifth floor from behind the painting in the room, just as Blanca did earlier.</p>
<p>While thinking about the countless doors that she saw while walking behind Blanca, including this room, Rosetta thought…</p>
<p>‘Indeed, privacy in this hotel… is this really okay?’</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but think this, but since she received help in this way, she couldn’t condemn Blanca for it.</p>
<p>“You really didn’t follow me, right?”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Rosetta had to ask because she felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Blanca listened to the question silently, then shook her head.</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s just that I noticed how two people in cloaks left… and I wondered when they would come back. And then, I checked through the window and saw you there.”</p>
<p>Just in case, if some complications occurred, what Blanca was saying was that she might have picked them up.</p>
<p>Her tone was still playful, but it didn’t seem like she was lying.</p>
<p>‘Certainly, I didn’t feel anyone on my trail while I was following Cassion. Maybe?’</p>
<p>In any case, Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m touched that you trust me. I knew it. Could this perhaps be because we’re meant to be?”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you…”</p>
<p>“Anyway.”</p>
<p>Blanca, who lightly covered Rosetta’s lips, slid down from her perch on the table.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look so good… Should I call for the doctor again?”</p>
<p>At Blanca’s words, she turned and looked towards Cassion.</p>
<p>His sleeping face was peaceful.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was a man who looked innocent while he slept.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Then, let me know when you want me to call one. I’ll call the doctor anytime. As you know, he has a very heavy tongue.”</p>
<p>“Alright, thank you. But before that, I have more things I want to request from you.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Again?”</p>
<p>Blanca asked about Rosetta’s request earlier.</p>
<p>Those were still under progress. Less than half a day has passed since that request was made.</p>
<p>However, what can she do?</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, ‘Madam Blanca’ is the most important character who made Cassion the Duke.</p>
<p>“Yes. Anyway, isn’t this hotel good? I have a lot of requests.”</p>
<p>If Rosetta were to turn it around here, then it was her who needed Blanca’s help now.</p>
<p>The woman, who was silent for a while, suddenly burst into a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>“You’re really interesting. Do you know? If someone makes more than three requests, we call them a ‘regular’. Lady Rosetta is a client who’s become a regular customer in the shortest time.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then, shall we do something more shocking?”</p>
<p>“Is it more shocking than before? No, just how much are you going to surprise me?”</p>
<p>Unlike her words, her voice was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced at her and took a slow step towards the table where Blanca was sitting.</p>
<p>When she pulled out an empty chair, Blanca naturally sat opposite Rosetta.</p>
<p>“So you’re quite serious?”</p>
<p>“I’d like to get things started in earnest. That’s why I came to this hotel. I thought you’d listen to my requests sincerely.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment. So, what is this shocking request?”</p>
<p>At a faint urge, Rosetta tapped the table with her fingertips.</p>
<p>The steady staccato broke through the silence.</p>
<p>With the shallow taps as a background music, Rosetta organized her thoughts, whether it would be alright to say what should be said in the future.</p>
<p>Words that are spilled out once couldn’t be picked back up again.</p>
<p>After a brief thought, she slowly opened her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“I’ll try to make you happy all my life.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“You won’t need to look for anything interesting going on anymore. I’ll make it fun for you.”</p>
<p>“Are you perhaps proposing to me? That’s what it sounds like.”</p>
<p>Rosetta rolled her eyes at Blanca’s secretive tone.</p>
<p>But as she listened to it, the nuance was clear.</p>
<p>“I know, right. I should have bought a ring. Unfortunately, I’ll have to give it to you next time. I just need to buy a big diamond and put it in your fourth finger, hm?”</p>
<p>Blanca held up the back of her left hand, then she nodded.</p>
<p>Beyond the mesh lace gloves, a ring on her fourth finger caught Rosetta’s eye.</p>
<p>It was a ring with a purple gem on it.</p>
<p>“That’s a very tempting offer, but unfortunately, there’s already someone who occupied the fourth finger.”</p>
<p>“You’re married?”</p>
<p>Rosetta was genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>In the novel, Blanca being married was never mentioned.</p>
<p>In fact, the only information about her was that she was an amazing guild owner, and that she had a penchant for ‘interesting things’.</p>
<p>Still, given her free-spirited nature and profession, Rosetta thought that she would have been single…</p>
<p>Blanca quietly rubbed her left ring finger, exactly where the ring was.</p>
<p>After that gentle touch, a calm voice that didn’t match her demeanor came out of her lips.</p>
<p>“I used to be. It ended when the other person died.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 27</p>
<p>It was very difficult to respond.</p>
<p>“Goodness.”</p>
<p>When Rosetta replied in this way, her tone tinged with a hint of regret, Blanca clenched a fist in the air, then hid her hand once more.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s enough about that. We didn’t even love each other in the first place.”</p>
<p>Considering the way she spoke about her dead husband, she spoke in a very unfriendly manner.</p>
<p>However, it was impossible to judge how their relationship was because of how affectionately she touched the ring earlier.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what you were about to mention earlier, Princess… I’m curious about that. My, well you even hastily made a grand proposal.”</p>
<p>As she had conducted herself calmly before, a polite voice spoke to Rosetta.</p>
<p>There was still curiosity there, but that was it.</p>
<p>If she wanted to stop negotiating, she wouldn’t have asked again.</p>
<p>For a moment, Rosetta glanced at Blanca’s hand for some reason, then she opened her lips to speak as she eyed Blanca’s veil.</p>
<p>“Madam Blanca. I hope you say only the truth. Do you know who this man is?”</p>
<p>At the serious question, Blanca thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p>“Only by chance. I already knew his face, so I recognized him at a glance.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then it’ll be easier for me to explain.”</p>
<p>Rosetta paused, then spoke again.</p>
<p>“I’m going to make this man a Duke.”</p>
<p>“Oh my.”</p>
<p>“So, I need your help on this. That is my request.”</p>
<p>Blanca was speechless, but she was covering her lips gleefully.</p>
<p>“You’ll drive the other son out… and make the eldest son the Duke?”</p>
<p>Blanca spoke to herself as though I couldn’t hear.</p>
<p>Then, as she leaned back on her chair, Rosetta felt the other woman’s reluctance.</p>
<p>“For one request… There’ll be a lot to do.”</p>
<p>She was a quick-witted merchant.</p>
<p>She would definitely be at a loss if she took on a request as big as this.</p>
<p>If she were to list down the requests that Rosetta had made…</p>
<p>A magic tool to change one’s appearance and an investigation on someone—these were both requests needed to make Cassion a Duke.</p>
<p>“Right. Of course, I’ll compensate you for everything.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was no shortage of financial resources.</p>
<p>Although she was an illegitimate child, Rosetta was treated like a ducal princess just like Alicia, except for the fact that her family was uncomfortable around her.</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, pocket money, anything else.</p>
<p>And what kind of allowance did a princess have in a wealthy Duchy such as theirs?</p>
<p>There wasn’t even any need to go to a safe to get the money needed. Jewelry boxes filled her dresser drawers.</p>
<p>She could even buy a few houses in the capital with those.</p>
<p>“Even if I look like this, I have some money.”</p>
<p>“…So you say, but you already look like you have a lot of money.”</p>
<p>With a disbelieving tone, Blanca gestured towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>“If you understand, then that’s fine. Anyway, as you know, I’ll need a lot of help to make that man a Duke.”</p>
<p>Rosetta paused.</p>
<p>If there was a teacup in front of her, she would have taken a sip. Then, she shifted her gaze towards the sleeping Cassion.</p>
<p>Even without looking at him, she knew that he would have a calm expression.</p>
<p>Rosetta was doing so much right now, but for whom was it for?</p>
<p>Of course, ‘Alicia’ was the fundamental reason.</p>
<p>She averted her eyes once more, recalling Alicia’s bright smile.</p>
<p>Then, as she looked at the woman wearing a veil, she opened her lips.</p>
<p>“Under the request to ‘make that man a Duke’, I would like to put together a list of smaller requests. To be honest, I’m just doing it this way because it would be annoying to request them one by one. I might need to contact you for a request in the future, and it would be tiring for me to come back here every time. And, the necessary requests I’ll ask of you at that time… I think you know what to expect.”</p>
<p>“In short, to make him a Duke, you want to borrow ‘me’ myself, is that it?”</p>
<p>“If you put it that way, then it would be like I’m tying you down. How about this—why don’t we work together towards one goal? I just want your helping hand. I don’t care if you continue taking requests from other people.”</p>
<p>The veil moved subtly.</p>
<p>Judging by how her shoulders were shaking, it was a silent laugh.</p>
<p>Then, she straightened her previously lax posture. She slowly turned towards Cassion.</p>
<p>“First, you have to tell me who that person is.”</p>
<p>“You’ve already figured out who he is.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t tell me directly, it’s in my code to continue to pretend not to know.”</p>
<p>It was a code she abided by because she valued clients’ secrets.</p>
<p>“Cassion Carter, the heir to the Carter family who can’t wield magic.”</p>
<p>“Aha.”</p>
<p>It was a soulless exclamation.</p>
<p>Staring at Cassion for a while, Blanca sat up straight.</p>
<p>“The price will be expensive. Will you still ask me to do it?”</p>
<p>“Can I pay the down payment first, then give you the rest later?”</p>
<p>“Why? You said you have more money than I think.”</p>
<p>“I have it, of course, but I don’t think it’s to the degree of abundance that you think. If you succeed later…”</p>
<p>Rosetta raised a finger and pointed towards Cassion.</p>
<p>“You can take more money from him, you know.”</p>
<p>Then, Rosetta cut through the air with the same finger, then pulled it back.</p>
<p>Blanca had no response.</p>
<p>Perhaps the way Rosetta looked as she leisurely sat was suspicious.</p>
<p>Silence filled the room.</p>
<p>Other than the sound of breathing from time to time, there was absolutely no sound.</p>
<p>How long did it stay that way? Soon, the sound of a surface being hit rang across the air.</p>
<p>In the same way that a sudden light in the midst of darkness would be blinking, the sound emitted during this prolonged silence was far too loud.</p>
<p>And the sound came from Blanca’s hand.</p>
<p>Her hand, which was on the glass table, tapped on the surface in a gradually increasing tempo.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked towards the veiled face, wondering if this was Blanca’s way of expressing her rejection, but Blanca leaned back on her seat just then.</p>
<p>“Ahahaha!”</p>
<p>And a burst of loud, boisterous laughter echoed in the air.</p>
<p>It was such a sudden outburst that Rosetta had to wonder where it was coming from.</p>
<p>Just as Blanca had tapped the table for a long time, she gradually stopped laughing only when her throat grew weary of her unruly peal of laughter.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>It seemed to be quite difficult for her to regain her breath. She kept saying, ‘Ha… p… pfft…’ while covering her face with a hand.</p>
<p>Only after she stopped laughing that the situation was placed back in order.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ha. I apologize deeply.”</p>
<p>With her hands still on her sides, she spoke in a breathless voice.</p>
<p>It was a long time before those words spilled out of her lips, and she sounded all the more amused.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. If you laugh, fortune will come to you. You’ll be more blessed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think what you promised is already here. I feel like I’ll be living every day in laughter from now on. How long has it been since I felt this way?”</p>
<p>As Blanca said this, she tapped on her chair’s armrest in a calm manner.</p>
<p>Ta, da, da, da, dak.</p>
<p>The sound of her five fingers tapping on the armrest was rhythmic.</p>
<p>“So, did you find an answer after you’ve laughed?”</p>
<p>“…First of all, it’s true that it’s unconventional and unimaginable. At the same time, it’s unprecedented yet plausible. So… I wonder how it would be possible to do this.”</p>
<p>A merchant’s tongue was very heavy.</p>
<p>With one final tap, a strange tension hovered in the air.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>When asked briefly, Blanca leaned forward.</p>
<p>She was so close that Rosetta thought that she might be able to see her features through the veil.</p>
<p>“Then first, I’ll treat this as a couple of requests from a regular customer. Collaboration—we’ll decide that later.”</p>
<p>Rosetta didn’t know if she saw it wrong or not, but she thought she might have seen red lips drawing a line beneath the veil.</p>
<p>“This feels like a test,” Rosetta said.</p>
<p>“Not at all. You don’t like this arrangement?”</p>
<p>“Did I say that? I’m pretty good at taking exams, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ah, more than you look again.”</p>
<p>Blanca chuckled, then she spoke in a hush once more.</p>
<p>“Then let me know if you have another request. Your goal is ambitious, so let’s leave it at that for now.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll leave after seeing your face.”</p>
<p>“Oh? So you have another request.”</p>
<p>Rosetta just shrugged at Blanca’s unenthused exclamation.</p>
<p>Even she knew that it was a lot for a request.</p>
<p>“This man needs a new status. And that person I mentioned before, the one I asked you to investigate.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that person is already under observation by our competent staff.”</p>
<p>There was one person that came to Rosetta’s mind when Blanca mentioned ‘competent staff’.</p>
<p>In the novel, the man who stood by her was entirely loyal and dedicated.</p>
<p>‘Was it Logan?’</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember the name well, but maybe it sounded similar.</p>
<p>In any case, even if she couldn’t remember the name, Rosetta knew that the employee Blanca mentioned was someone reliable.</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Cassion and that person. They both need fake titles. Definitely enough for them to get jobs at my family’s estate.”</p>
<p>“In short, you’re asking me to make new identities for them so that they can enter your family’s estate, correct?”</p>
<p>“Can you do it?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Blanca showed the back of her right hand.</p>
<p>Then, she flapped her ring finger.</p>
<p>She fluttered her finger in the air as though it was a butterfly’s wing.</p>
<p>“I’ll take you up on your offer of diamonds. Fortunately, my ring finger on my right hand is empty.”</p>
<p>Meaning, it was an obvious acceptance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Standing by the entrance of the garden, I stared at David’s retreating figure as he walked away. His excitement was obvious just by looking at his back.</p>
<p>Sure, that’s good.</p>
<p>Be utterly confident that you would win.</p>
<p>This should be a lesson to you. Even a person you trust could stab you in the back with an axe.</p>
<p>Once David was completely out of sight, someone took the place beside me.</p>
<p>A tall man who stood beneath the sun’s rays and created long shadows.</p>
<p>I looked sideways and glanced at the person standing next to me.</p>
<p>Cassion stiffly stared at the direction where David had disappeared to.</p>
<p>On that hardened expression, there was a vicious look in his eyes.</p>
<p>As if he was cursing the other man with just his glare alone.</p>
<p>“Makes me feel shitty.”</p>
<p>In fact, he even spat out these words with utmost dissatisfaction.</p>
<p>Cassion said the words so bluntly. It surprised me a little because it’s the first time I’m hearing something like this from him.</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Even as I asked, he didn’t look my way.</p>
<p>However, with a sigh, he closed his eyes tightly and swept back his fringe.</p>
<p>The hand he used to do that was shaking.</p>
<p>This, too, was out of character for him.</p>
<p>Soon, Cassion slowly opened his eyes once more.</p>
<p>His black eyes were deeper than the shadows. That dark gaze turned to me as he opened his lips to speak.</p>
<p>“I want to gouge out that man’s eyes—I had a thought like this today, for the first time in my life.”</p>
<p>Obviously, the target wasn’t me.</p>
<p>I had the same thought, when David was leering at my body like that a while ago.</p>
<p>And yet as I saw how vicious these black eyes were, chills ran down my spine as though I was the target of his fury.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>Funnily enough, it didn’t feel all that bad.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 62</p>
<p>We soon moved to a different place.</p>
<p>There were no other people in that garden, but just in case, we headed towards a place that was less likely for people to go to.</p>
<p>The topic of our conversation needed to be kept of utmost secrecy, so we had to be extra careful.</p>
<p>We eventually arrived at the trail behind the lateral mansion. It’s the same path that led to the clearing where Cassion regularly trained.</p>
<p>The tops of our heads were being shined down upon by the blazing sun.</p>
<p>However, as we entered the trail, the shadows blocked the sun.</p>
<p>A gentle breeze, blowing in from an unknown place, tickled the leaves.</p>
<p>That wind brushed past one, twice, three times through the trees and birds, gradually becoming stronger.</p>
<p>Until the point where the breeze gave off a cool, refreshing feeling as it finally reached us.</p>
<p>Shwaaa—</p>
<p>The wind sounded like the ocean’s waves.</p>
<p>With the sound of the wind accompanying us like a friend, we walked silently side by side, saying nothing at all until the entrance of the forest was far out of sight.</p>
<p>“Do you think he’s been provoked properly just as planned?”</p>
<p>Cassion nodded, then replied.</p>
<p>Though he still seemed displeased.</p>
<p>“But rather than that, I should have been the one who did it.”</p>
<p>His voice, too, still held a semblance of hostility.</p>
<p>Without a word, I just stared at him for a moment, then soon answered as I shrugged.</p>
<p>“Don’t you think that might have been less effective though? A guy like that would shake greedily when a gold bar is being dangled right in front of his eyes, you know. If you’re the one who came forward, then you would have provoked only his anger, not his greed.”</p>
<p>I said nothing but the truth.</p>
<p>Whether or not he really had something to say back, Cassion stayed silent.</p>
<p>Our plan was to rouse David’s greed and make him more determined to ‘do whatever trick there was to beat Cassion’.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p>So consequently, for the sake of a landslide victory, David would be sure to pull out whatever underhanded, nasty tricks he had up his sleeve.</p>
<p>‘I heard that he has a penchant for drugging his opponents’ food.’</p>
<p>At any rate, it was cunning.</p>
<p>Just as much as his physique was large, so too was his shamelessness.</p>
<p>We’re going to take full advantage of his cowardly methods.</p>
<p>The name of the game was, ‘Falling for my own scheme’.</p>
<p>The inevitable conclusion was that he would be humiliated, would lose the match and we’d also catch him at his weakest.</p>
<p>Was there a plan more perfect than this?</p>
<p>Cassion remained silent for some time, thinking hard.</p>
<p>Once again, the breeze passed by amidst the silence.</p>
<p>As the green foliage shone beneath the sun’s rays, the fluttering of the leaves made the shadows beneath them dance beautifully.</p>
<p>Eventually, the man’s closed lips opened once more.</p>
<p>“But I hate that you have to be looked at like that just because of me.”</p>
<p>Ta-dak, ta-dak. The sound of his footsteps was even.</p>
<p>Focusing on listening to those footsteps, I asked back.</p>
<p>“Because of you?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it because of me that David was singled out as my opponent?”</p>
<p>“No? It’s because I got angry when he trash talked like that yesterday? Your opponent got selected in any case, so just give it your best shot.”</p>
<p>As I denied his guess, I chuckled lightheartedly, as though amused by a misstep.</p>
<p>At the same time, I glanced towards Cassion’s side profile.</p>
<p>Covered by the shadows, the man was motionless.</p>
<p>“Should I?”</p>
<p>“Mmh. You should.”</p>
<p>A short question and a short answer had been exchanged. Cassion nodded slowly.</p>
<p>Then, one, two, three steps.</p>
<p>He strode forward in the same cadence as the sound of the passing breeze.</p>
<p>“I, again. I thought that you were trying to remove that label on me.”</p>
<p>To keep me from being mocked and looked down on.</p>
<p>Now, even the added whisper had a hint of laughter.</p>
<p>Though it didn’t sound like genuine delight.</p>
<p>The footsteps stopped. Cassion had walked past me.</p>
<p>One step, two steps, three steps.</p>
<p>Just three steps.</p>
<p>Slowly, the man stopped there, three steps away from me. His back was wide.</p>
<p>Perhaps wider compared to when we first met.</p>
<p>Beneath the shadows, the hair that was supposed to be the shade of the dark blue evening sky, now looked completely black. His hair also was cut short before he entered the mansion, but now it was a little longer.</p>
<p>The breeze from who-knows-where blew once more, as gentle as a wildflower.</p>
<p>The man with dark hair slowly turned around.</p>
<p>And our eyes met.</p>
<p>“What, then am I really wrong?”</p>
<p>The question was repeated.</p>
<p>I could hear no laughter in his voice this time, but there was a smile on his lips. I stared at him for a moment before I nodded.</p>
<p>“No. You’re right.”</p>
<p>How paradoxical, maybe, but what spilled through my lips was what’s truly wrong.</p>
<p>Truthfully, he was right about what he said.</p>
<p>I explained my plan to the three people yesterday.</p>
<p>Although I didn’t elaborate on why I selected David as Cassion’s opponent.</p>
<p>Roughly speaking, it’s like an act of retribution against him for what he said at the training hall.</p>
<p>Diana and Logan seemed to believe this. However, that wasn’t my true reason.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether he swore at me behind my back, I didn’t care about getting even with him about that.</p>
<p>I’m not such a petty person to do that. In the first place, this body wasn’t mine and I’m not really the one he’s talking shit about.</p>
<p>Even if more guys like him appeared in a truck and swore at me, it would be nothing but the background noise of dogs barking in my perspective.</p>
<p>Well. I did somehow get ticked off when he mentioned something about being a ‘criminal’s daughter’.</p>
<p>Anyway.</p>
<p>Indeed, the reason why I chose David as Cassion’s opponent was, as Cassion said, to quell the negative public opinion about him being my escort knight.</p>
<p>To be honest, since it’s true that Cassion entered the mansion and was about to get a high position through nepotism, it’s only natural that he’d be received negatively to some extent.</p>
<p>Right. The key words here were ‘to some extent’.</p>
<p>As of this moment, he’s already being called ‘street rat’, but it’s not like he’s being cursed at and harassed to the point that his human rights were being violated.</p>
<p>But if I don’t nip it in the bud from the very beginning, everyone would look down at Cassion as being nothing more than a ‘street rat’ for as long as he’s living as Maxwell.</p>
<p>‘I can’t stand it.’</p>
<p>Even though Cassion didn’t seem to care about this, while he’s living here…</p>
<p>At the very least, I want him to have a better life as Maxwell.</p>
<p>Not as a helpless man who’s surrounded by enemies, but to live with a little peace of mind.</p>
<p>Of course, technically speaking, Cassion was still currently surrounded by enemies.</p>
<p>But, well, let’s set that aside for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, what’s the best method to remove that ‘street rat’ label on him?</p>
<p>What’s the best way to rehabilitate the negative image of a parachute employee?</p>
<p>Honestly, what’s happened, happened.</p>
<p>The fact that he entered this place through a route filled with more fortune than everyone else—this would not change.</p>
<p>That’s what could still be changed was other people’s opinion by demonstrating just how capable he actually was.</p>
<p>For example, to show results.</p>
<p>‘If I just picked a knight who’s been in the knight order for less than two years, as Damian had suggested, it would definitely be a piece of cake for Cassion to win.’</p>
<p>But that would be all.</p>
<p>It’s not such a feat to triumph over an easy opponent.</p>
<p>People would just say, ‘Well, who couldn’t?’</p>
<p>They would look down on Cassion’s efforts and skills regardless and continue undermining him somehow.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>The leader of all the harassment.</p>
<p>The situation would be different if Cassion were to win over the person who’s holding the most power right now.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be coincidence, neither would it be luck. A close fight would be shown, and then once he beats the one on top…</p>
<p>‘It’s only a matter of time until the others’ opinions will change.’</p>
<p>Because, when faced with real talent, people will finally shut their mouths.</p>
<p>That’s why David was chosen.</p>
<p>He was at the center of the people against Cassion, and at the same time, he was the knight who’s ranked at the top in terms of skill.</p>
<p>Besides that, it would be easy to catch his weak points because all this time, he has only been using ‘underhanded tricks’.</p>
<p>As long as there was a need to say ‘just in case’, shouldn’t all insurance be prepared beforehand?</p>
<p>Just like with Diana.</p>
<p>Anyhow, the requirements had been met in many ways here.</p>
<p>I didn’t feel the need to explain all this to the others, so I just used the excuse of seeking vengeance for the trash talking that David did.</p>
<p>No. Perhaps it’s not because ‘I don’t feel the need’ to do it.</p>
<p>‘It’s just, because Cassion shouldn’t be looked down on.’</p>
<p>I don’t want the truth to be found out, is all.</p>
<p>But in any case, he noticed.</p>
<p>He knew what’s going on.</p>
<p>What a strange guy, Cassion was.</p>
<p>He looked like he’s a bit dense, but at the same time seemed to be a pure person who would hold out his heart on his sleeve.</p>
<p>Sometimes, that innocent face would just strike me so sharply.</p>
<p>It’s really all too strange.</p>
<p>It’s amazing. And also frightening.</p>
<p>He kept seeing through me, kept being so aware of me.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, I’m even afraid he might notice that I’m a different person beneath this shell.</p>
<p>Being found out to be a fake by someone who’s close to me would only be troublesome to me.</p>
<p>‘Katie was about to die back then, so it didn’t matter, but here…’</p>
<p>Cassion cannot die.</p>
<p>I lifted the corners of my lips.</p>
<p>A perfect arc.</p>
<p>Because I had been wearing only the shell of other people for a while now, this mask was familiar.</p>
<p>So, don’t look inside any more than this.</p>
<p>One, two, three steps.</p>
<p>I walked forward and stood next to Cassion. Like lamps, his black eyes followed my movements.</p>
<p>“It’s good that you’re quick-witted, but don’t try to read into things too much.”</p>
<p>Hearing what I said, Cassion’s expression grew blank.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>His voice was full of questions, but all I did was walk past him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Leaving behind the subdued atmosphere of that moment, we walked side by side again and continued our earlier conversation.</p>
<p>“Does it bother you that you’re going to have a match with David? Just in case, there’s also the second best—but you know, just as what he’s called, he’s just the second best.”</p>
<p>As though the air around them had never grown somber, their conversation felt the same as the usual.</p>
<p>“I have to go against him. Of course I will.”</p>
<p>And when Cassion answered, it seemed like there was a glint in his eyes.</p>
<p>This was a satisfactory response.</p>
<p>Even if he was faced with a more skillful opponent, it wouldn’t be good to tuck one’s tail before trying.</p>
<p>“Alright. Even if you lose, don’t worry. If the situation doesn’t permit you winning, then we can just switch over to Plan B. But you know, you’re going to win anyway.”</p>
<p>“…Plan B……”</p>
<p>“Well, frankly speaking, I think you can win at the level you’re at now.”</p>
<p>“You believe in me?”</p>
<p>The question seemed to just want me to repeat what I’ve said.</p>
<p>As if he just wanted to hear me say, ‘Yes.’</p>
<p>Raising one eyebrow slightly, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes. I believe in you.”</p>
<p>It was a firm answer.</p>
<p>After hearing this confirmation, the look in the man’s eyes relaxed. With his eyes now curved, he looked very happy with this.</p>
<p>How silly.</p>
<p>Pushing down the urge to smile as well, I spoke instead.</p>
<p>“If you have to, you can use magic too, just don’t get caught. No one should know that you’re a mage, so do it secretly.”</p>
<p>I was being serious, but I heard a sigh from him beside me.</p>
<p>“Are you talking about that from last time? The 〈 Practical Magic Spells to Use During an Actual Fight That No One Would Notice 〉?”</p>
<p>“Yep, that one. Did you practice?”</p>
<p>Even as I waited, there was no answer.</p>
<p>A stiff expression and a blank gaze. Silence.</p>
<p>His reaction was enough of an answer for me, and this time, I couldn’t hold back my laughter.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 63</p>
<p>I laughed boisterously for a long time, all the while feeling Cassion’s eyes on me.</p>
<p>At his glare, I tried to stop laughing.</p>
<p>But my efforts didn’t bear fruit at all.</p>
<p>It looked as though he was taking it in stride, but he shook his head and spoke.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ll take care of it to the best of my abilities. But if you think it’s not going to work, then I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p>Hm? This is unexpected.</p>
<p>Honestly, I thought he’d be a stickler for the rules.</p>
<p>I knew he’d accept it even though he were to be saddled with the second best, but he’s even saying ‘I’ll leave it to you’ now. I didn’t expect that.</p>
<p>“You’re not telling me that you’re not going to do it? To be honest, I thought you’d be reluctant to cheat.”</p>
<p>Hearing me say this, Cassion glanced at me.</p>
<p>And casually replied back.</p>
<p>“Whatever it takes, I need to stay beside you.”</p>
<p>With a passionate determination.</p>
<p>“Really. Whatever it takes.”</p>
<p>The type of determination that was as heated as the midsummer sun.</p>
<p>‘When you said you need to stay beside me, I know what you mean. But there’s something behind this that’s making me feel strange.</p>
<p>I blinked for a moment, then nodded.</p>
<p>“Right. Stay by my side. Don’t you ever die.”</p>
<p>As I laughed and whispered this to him, Cassion was the first to avert his gaze.</p>
<p>Shwaaa—</p>
<p>Once again, the breeze blew in from an unknown place.</p>
<p>The wind fluttered the leaves and blew past my hair. As I held it back with one hand, I looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>That clear, blue sky.</p>
<p>Still, it wouldn’t be like that for long. The monsoon season was expected to begin next month.</p>
<p>‘Three weeks from now is Cassion’s match, and… the week after that…’</p>
<p>Was Cassion’s funeral.</p>
<p>Yes, right as the rain would pour down from the heavens.</p>
<p>They had already sent out obituaries to the other households, but I hadn’t told Cassion about it yet.</p>
<p>I’m worried that his mental fortitude would be shaken once he found out.</p>
<p>He had an important match ahead, and it would be a problem if he’s distracted by something else.</p>
<p>Still, I knew that I wouldn’t be able to hide it forever.</p>
<p>‘It’s none other than his own funeral after all.’</p>
<p>I’ll tell him after the match.</p>
<p>Yeah. After he wins.</p>
<p>‘So, before that…’</p>
<p>“You know there’s only about three weeks left until the match, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m aware.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s go on an outing next week.”</p>
<p>“Outing?”</p>
<p>His tone was perplexed.</p>
<p>“How is that related to the match?”</p>
<p>He asked the right question once again, and at this, I smiled and nodded.</p>
<p>“Mm. Let’s get you some hands-on practice.”</p>
<p>“Hands-on practice…?”</p>
<p>“By nature, people learn more through real experience. I’ll prepare it well, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>Well, it’s not actually me. Blanca’s the one preparing it.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Cassion stayed silent.</p>
<p>All he did was look at me with worry in his eyes.</p>
<p>What the hell are you up to…</p>
<p>With the kind of expression that seemed to say this.</p>
<p>I laughed off his concerns.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I say not to worry? I’ll let you practice safe and sound.”</p>
<p>But the mistrust and apprehension in his eyes still wouldn’t go away.</p>
<p>I reached into my pocket and handed him a note.</p>
<p>Baffled, Cassion took it from me.</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Open it.”</p>
<p>He glanced at me first, but soon opened the note.</p>
<p>“Black Lion Guild?”</p>
<p>What Cassion muttered to himself was the name of the guild, which was written at the top of the note.</p>
<p>It’s nothing but a shady guild, but what a grandiose name it had…</p>
<p>As he skimmed the contents of the note, he soon asked.</p>
<p>“By chance, this… Is it…?”</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. That’s the guild that Diana belonged to before.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>His brows furrowed as he stood in silence.</p>
<p>When I brought Diana back, of course Cassion also was with us back then.</p>
<p>So, while I told Diana about the secret behind the guild, Cassion was also listening to everything.</p>
<p>That the guild, all this time, had been selling fake medicine to Diana while exploiting her through labor.</p>
<p>I reached out one finger towards the middle of Cassion’s furrowed brows.</p>
<p>Tap.</p>
<p>As my fingertip touched the middle of the wrinkled brows, they flinched as though they were mimosas.</p>
<p>And he looked at me with such a startled gaze.</p>
<p>Retracting my hand, I grinned as I looked into his eyes.</p>
<p>“Your forehead— it’ll have wrinkles.”</p>
<p>“Hah…”</p>
<p>With a helpless smile, Cassion shook his head.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I promise Diana back then? That she’ll have her chance at revenge.”</p>
<p>Now with a smooth brow, he answered.</p>
<p>“Then the hands-on practice…”</p>
<p>“Yup. We’ll turn that place upside down.”</p>
<p>With you there as well, of course.</p>
<p>As I craned my neck and whispered near his ears, Cassion shivered slightly and flinched away.</p>
<p>I laughed.</p>
<p>Ah, I’m so looking forward to next week.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the Black Lion Guild—</p>
<p>“You useless punks!”</p>
<p>It was in the back alleys of the city that a loud shout broke out from the sunless wooden building.</p>
<p>The person who yelled like that was Owen, the leader of the Black Lion Guild.</p>
<p>And there before him stood a bulky man who had his head down.</p>
<p>One side of his face was read because he had just gotten slapped by Owen.</p>
<p>But even as Owen saw the other man’s red cheek, he huffed and puffed, letting out his anger as though he was yet to be satisfied with just one hit.</p>
<p>It’s been like this for a few years now.</p>
<p>The number of requests to the guild were on the decline, and the guild members kept failing to carry out their duties properly.</p>
<p>Enraged by this, Owen frequently took it out on the guild members.</p>
<p>As this continued to happen, Owen was like a ticking time bomb that’s waiting to explode at any given moment.</p>
<p>“Huu…”</p>
<p>He let out a meandering exhale after he finished drinking his cold water.</p>
<p>He waved his empty hand in the air like a whip.</p>
<p>Seeing the signal to get out, the bulky man bowed to Owen and promptly left through the door.</p>
<p>Owen gulped down his cold water again, but soon threw the glass once it was empty.</p>
<p>Towards the door where the other man had just left.</p>
<p>The glass quickly hit the wall next to the door and broke into pieces.</p>
<p>“Damn it… damn it, damn it!”</p>
<p>Perhaps unable to forget it, Owen cursed out repeatedly.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stand not swearing at a situation like this.</p>
<p>After letting out a long stream of curses, one person’s face stuck out in his mind.</p>
<p>The person who made him end up like this.</p>
<p>That wench.</p>
<p>“Diana…”</p>
<p>His guild began having a much more difficult time at a rapid pace after Diana suddenly disappeared.</p>
<p>She was the best employee he had in the Black Lion Guild, and since the greatest driver to his company had disappeared, there’s no one else who could do the requests properly.</p>
<p>And right on cue, the requests were decreasing…</p>
<p>Since there were no requests coming in, the money that passed through his hands also gradually decreased.</p>
<p>That’s why he somehow tried to look for Diana.</p>
<p>He went to look for her at her house first, but he found not even one personal belonging there, let alone the person herself.</p>
<p>Ever since then, he ordered the guild members to search for any trace of the girl.</p>
<p>However, even a month later, not one single clue turned up.</p>
<p>It’s as if she just vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>His teeth gnashed together with a distinct grinding sound.</p>
<p>His insides were all twisted up out of frustration.</p>
<p>‘That wench… just took my money and left.’</p>
<p>Diana had a debt that she had yet to fully repay.</p>
<p>Of course, if it hadn’t been for the unfair interest rate and the much too small wage he was giving her, she’d have already paid him back in full, but…</p>
<p>That’s none of his concern.</p>
<p>The important thing here was that she’s nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Without paying back his money.</p>
<p>Owen huffed out another curse word, then he took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He spent so much time thinking about how to find her that he was about to calm down, but then a sharp knock came from outside the door right then.</p>
<p>“…WHAT?!”</p>
<p>As he was holding onto his temples, Owen shouted back loudly.</p>
<p>“Um, Guildmaster, sir. We have a client.”</p>
<p>“Client…?”</p>
<p>At the first mention of a client, Owen looked up with a sharp glint in his eye.</p>
<p>Normally, small requests were dealt with by guild members right outside the door.</p>
<p>But the fact that news of a client came all the way to his office meant that it was going to be a fairly lucrative deal.</p>
<p>These days, to quench the thirst of his throat that craved for grape wine, here appeared a client that brings with them money.</p>
<p>It was like welcoming a downpour of rain after a difficult drought.</p>
<p>“Tell— Tell the client to come in!”</p>
<p>Excited, Owen answered back and then heard footsteps outside the door. The guild member moved away from the door for a moment, but the distant steps came back in no time.</p>
<p>Soon after, the door slowly opened, and the client appeared before him.</p>
<p>Owen sprang up to his feet and greeted his client.</p>
<p>It was a suspicious looking woman with a veil covering her face.</p>
<p>However, if it’s like this, then it probably meant that he’d get a bigger harvest.</p>
<p>Shady guilds like his were originally responsible for requests that couldn’t be entrusted to anyone else after all, so the more a client would hide their identity, the more important their requests usually were.</p>
<p>Ta-dak, ta-dak.</p>
<p>The woman with the veil did not come into the room, only turned her head to the side.</p>
<p>“Oh my?”</p>
<p>Beyond the veil came a short exclamation that sounded like a snicker.</p>
<p>The spot she was looking at was where the broken glass had landed in shards.</p>
<p>Startled out of his stupor, Owen beckoned to the man behind the client.</p>
<p>Get rid of it.</p>
<p>The guild member, who had ushered the client here to the office, nodded and went to get a broom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the woman stepped over the broken glass and headed towards the sofa.</p>
<p>“Goodness, you must have been surprised. One of our staff dropped a glass by mistake earlier.”</p>
<p>“Uh-huh. Really?”</p>
<p>I don’t think so, but sure…</p>
<p>The woman beneath the veil added one more thing as she hummed, but Owen didn’t hear this.</p>
<p>His eyes and ears were already so focused on the ‘VIP request after such a long time’ he was about to receive.</p>
<p>“Now then… The request you have for us, dear client—shall we hear it?”</p>
<p>Owen rubbed his hands together as he asked, and the woman leaned back against the cheap sofa.</p>
<p>Leisurely tapping one finger up and down, she opened her lips and spoke with the same relaxed tone.</p>
<p>“My request is…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 64</p>
<p>A few days later—</p>
<p>It was during the cool, chilly dawn, with the atmosphere and mood subdued.</p>
<p>Several men were gathered along the riverbank, where the hushed mood lingered.</p>
<p>Five people.</p>
<p>No, six people in total. There was one more person here meant to retrieve something from the other five.</p>
<p>After being handed over a box from the other five men, the green haired man who was wearing a silver-rimmed pair of glasses cursorily checked the package. Then, he wrote something down on the piece of paper that was in his hand.</p>
<p>The hand that moved busily stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>Through the glasses, aloof grayish-green eyes scanned the men sharply.</p>
<p>“Let me double check. This is 1000 gold, this is 520 gold— correct?”</p>
<p>The man pointed towards the two packages with his pen.</p>
<p>Both boxes were brimming with gold.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Then the agreed upon price…”</p>
<p>“Yes, just as promised, I’ve written down twice the amount of what you paid.”</p>
<p>2000 gold, 1040 gold.</p>
<p>The other five men gaped open as the green-haired man muttered out the price.</p>
<p>He plucked off two checks and gave them to the five men.</p>
<p>Owen’s eyes were about to bug out of their sockets when he saw that the amount doubled in a literal instant.</p>
<p>“This is the end of our deal. Just as promised, you can go to the Grand Bank one week later and exchange the checks for cash. Congratulations on becoming a passenger.”</p>
<p>The green-haired man, that is, Logan, gave them a business-like smile.</p>
<p>He reached out for a handshake, and Owen gladly took his hand and whipped it up and down.</p>
<p>“Well, we’re all on the same boat, so please take good care of us.”</p>
<p>Logan smiled coldly at the voice full of greed.</p>
<p>Then, he naturally loosened his grip and replied.</p>
<p>“Do take care.”</p>
<p>Logan’s voice was exceedingly cold, but Owen and his men didn’t notice at all.</p>
<p>Because they were already fantasizing about being rich.</p>
<p>‘1040 gold…’</p>
<p>With this kind of money, it’s possible to buy a three-storey townhouse in the capital.</p>
<p>It would have been better if they were given more money, but this was all they could get right now.</p>
<p>‘Yeah… It’s a shame, but where will just this take me? I can easily double my money like this.’</p>
<p>Though Owen smacked his lips in regret, he was all twisted up in delight.</p>
<p>It was all thanks to the lady client who came before.</p>
<p>A few days ago—</p>
<p>Upon entering the office, the veiled woman gave her request.</p>
<p>‘Two days later, please take this money to the riverbank. Give it all to the green-haired man and exchange it for checks that have double the original amount.’</p>
<p>The request was incredibly unusual.</p>
<p>To give boxes full of gold coins and return with checks indicating double the amount of money.</p>
<p>When the woman entrusted her request, she was looking around nervously.</p>
<p>It’s difficult to see what kind of expression she had beneath the veil, but just by observing her lips, it’s easy to see how nervous she was.</p>
<p>Owen licked his own dry lips with his tongue.</p>
<p>‘By chance, may I ask the reason for your request?’</p>
<p>‘Th…The reason, why do you want to know?’</p>
<p>Owen whispered when he asked, yet the woman answered with a question as well. She was visibly flustered.</p>
<p>Waving his hand casually as if to reassure her, Owen continued.</p>
<p>‘No, it’s just, to be honest… Safety isn’t guaranteed in this request, is it? That’s why I need to know more details so that I can give you satisfactory results. After all, we’re in this kind of profession. Our lips are tightly sealed. That’s why please rest assured. You can tell me everything.’</p>
<p>He was so obviously lathering honey to his words. It looked like the woman was mulling over it for a moment.</p>
<p>Then she nodded and fessed up to everything as she stammered.</p>
<p>‘Honestly, this money… it’s supposed to be to recover a shipwreck.’</p>
<p>‘A shipwreck?’</p>
<p>‘Yes, a shipwreck. It’s… not just any shipwreck. The ship was in the middle of transporting the treasures of a foreign country’s imperial family, but it sank while at sea.’</p>
<p>Then she explained further.</p>
<p>Decades ago, a ship full of treasures, owned by a foreign country’s imperial family, was met with a storm. It subsequently sank into the depths of the waters.</p>
<p>Many people had tried to find the ship full of valuable treasures and expensive jewelry, but they couldn’t.</p>
<p>And today, decades later.</p>
<p>The site of the shipwreck had finally been found.</p>
<p>However, it was going to take a lot of money and manpower to recover its riches.</p>
<p>Accordingly, news secretly began to spread amongst a small group of wealthy people.</p>
<p>They’re going to invest in the recovery of the shipwreck, then as soon as the ship was raised, the funds they had originally pitched in would be doubled.</p>
<p>‘To be honest, it’s too good to be true, so I couldn’t believe it at first.’</p>
<p>But because the person who found the shipwreck was a very reliable person, and because it’s been secretly investigated, it was found out that the ship truly was full of treasures.</p>
<p>Thus, one by one, those wealthy people began to invest in the shipwreck’s recovery.</p>
<p>Rumors inevitably spread, and the number of investors increased. The manager then made a rule.</p>
<p>〈 You cannot invest unless you have been invited or personally introduced. 〉</p>
<p>The last day was also in a week’s time, but by the time the woman had come to this guild, there were only two days left until the deadline.</p>
<p>‘So many wealthy people will be investing anyway, so there shouldn’t be a shortage of funds, yes? I barely got an invitation this afternoon.’</p>
<p>She said that she was lucky enough to get a chance to join the ranks of the investors.</p>
<p>However, she needed the help of the guild because she’s going to invest her hidden slush funds. This was something she decided on behind her husband’s back.</p>
<p>After she finished telling her story, the woman brought a handkerchief to the side of her veil, wiping away a few droplets of sweat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, that woman’s hand came into Owen’s sight.</p>
<p>A big diamond ring lined with blue sapphires.</p>
<p>And on her wrist, too, was a bracelet that looked like it’s made with pure, solid gold. At just one glance, it’s clear that it didn’t have an ordinary design. And, at just one glance, it’s clear that it was not fake.</p>
<p>A noble?</p>
<p>Right. Judging by her appearance, she must really be a noble. That picturesque posture was something that couldn’t be imitated either.</p>
<p>With a wide grin, Owen made a suggestion to the woman.</p>
<p>That she didn’t need to pay the commission fee. Instead, just introduce him to the investment circle.</p>
<p>The woman thought about it long and hard, but when Owen repeatedly buttered her up, she had no choice but to nod.</p>
<p>It remained a secret, just what kind of expression she was making at that moment beneath the veil.</p>
<p>And now, back to the present—</p>
<p>Owen and his men walked away from the riverbank. His steps were light and gleeful.</p>
<p>No, well, it was supposed to be like that.</p>
<p>Until the end of his gaze had settled upon a familiar figure.</p>
<p>The delightedly humming man who had a skip to his step suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p>
<p>He folded up his precious check as though this itself was the treasure.</p>
<p>He didn’t even know that it was nothing but a fake check—merely a piece of paper.</p>
<p>He confirmed that the check went into his chest pocket then proceeded to button his shirt tightly. This made him feel a bit reassured.</p>
<p>Pat, pat. He patted over the place where the pocket was located, then soon approached the familiar figure. No, that familiar woman.</p>
<p>Stomp, stomp.</p>
<p>His steps were heavy upon the hard floor. To the extent that the other person noticed his and his men’s presence.</p>
<p>Owen and the woman’s eyes met in the air.</p>
<p>Gnash.</p>
<p>As Owen clenched his jaw and gritted his molars together, the grinding sound was audible from his teeth.</p>
<p>“Been a while, Diana.”</p>
<p>His voice was just as rough as his gnashed molars.</p>
<p>Towards his employee, Diana, who dared run away like a rat.</p>
<p>Diana’s legs stayed in place as she looked back at Owen and his men.</p>
<p>Showing no signs of avoidance or surprise.</p>
<p>And there, in her hand, was a heavy looking pouch.</p>
<p>Owen scanned through her countenance as he pasted a fake smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“Seems like you’ve been eating well enough someplace else, huh? You look like you’re doing well. Very much.”</p>
<p>Thinking that Diana was too scared to even open her mouth here, Owen snickered.</p>
<p>“What, so did you enjoy playing our little game of tag? But what to do. You got caught already, hm?”</p>
<p>Watching him act like he’s scaring some child with those sarcastic remarks, Diana let out a small laugh.</p>
<p>“Tag, you say? With what kind of bravado do you say that.”</p>
<p>When Diana wrinkled her nose as she said that, Owen’s expression hardened.</p>
<p>To him, Diana was nothing but a slave.</p>
<p>She owed him money, and at the same time, he’s the one supplying her with her younger sister’s medicine.</p>
<p>It was because of this that he didn’t have to waste money on her.</p>
<p>She was a capable, efficient and inexpensive slave.</p>
<p>But then she ran away.</p>
<p>Without paying back his money.</p>
<p>And then, right to his face, she’s out here mocking him?</p>
<p>He never heard anything like this from Diana before.</p>
<p>It’s always been like this—that Owen would spit out curses or slap the other person across the face. Never the other way around.</p>
<p>Realizing just what happened, Owen’s face turned entirely red with anger.</p>
<p>“Yeah, alright. We haven’t seen each other in a while. It seems like you forgot that I fed you and put a roof over your head, huh?!”</p>
<p>While shouting nonsense, the man grabbed Diana’s wrist roughly.</p>
<p>At the same time, the pouch she was holding slightly opened.</p>
<p>And Owen’s gaze lingered there for a moment.</p>
<p>From the pouch’s opening, he glimpsed sparkling gold.</p>
<p>At this, greed immediately flashed over his face.</p>
<p>“What’s with this money. It’s… mine, right?”</p>
<p>“The hell you talking about.”</p>
<p>Hearing that absurd question, Diana shook off the grip on her wrist and answered like this.</p>
<p>But then Owen’s grip wouldn’t budge, as though he was a leech that wouldn’t let go of Diana’s wrist.</p>
<p>Rather, this just made his eyes have an even greedier look.</p>
<p>“You took my money and ran away, yeah? Am I wrong?!”</p>
<p>“Ha. You check the safe every single day without fail. You’re the one who knows best if it’s empty or not.”</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s just as Diana said.</p>
<p>The Black Lion Guild’s safe was managed meticulously by Owen.</p>
<p>It was perhaps in his job description to sniff the fragrant smell of his money before actually doing work. He did this every day. That’s why Owen was the one who knew best whether the safe was empty or not.</p>
<p>In other words, he was saying nothing but bull.</p>
<p>Even so, he didn’t retract his accusation.</p>
<p>Though Diana didn’t rob the safe, the money she was holding now was his money.</p>
<p>Diana had yet to fully pay back the money she owed him, and her absence from the guild incurred a loss from all the requests that couldn’t be fulfilled.</p>
<p>After all, wasn’t all of Diana’s debt his loss?</p>
<p>“You ungrateful, shameless wench… How dare you run away with my money?! I’m gonna break your legs this time. You’re nothing but a thief—”</p>
<p>What the hell are you all waiting for. Grab her!</p>
<p>Now with his eyes turned upside down, Owen shouted at his men.</p>
<p>And these loyal lackeys immediately obeyed their guildmaster’s orders.</p>
<p>However, these actions did not achieve the results he wanted.</p>
<p>First, Diana flung the pouch full of gold behind her, grabbed Owen’s arm and twisted it over.</p>
<p>Second, a man with a large physique appeared out of nowhere.</p>
<p>“ARGH!”</p>
<p>With his arm twisted, Owen’s shoulder was also grabbed. At this, he yelled out.</p>
<p>Diana pushed him down with no remorse, and so Owen rolled horrendously on the ground.</p>
<p>There, Owen wriggled and tried to get up.</p>
<p>However, as he looked up at Diana and the man next to her, the corner of his lips turned up into a scathing smile.</p>
<p>“What the… I was wondering why you suddenly look like you’re glowing, but I guess you got yourself a husband, huh?”</p>
<p>The moment Owen said that, both Diana and Cassion’s eyebrows twitched.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 65</p>
<p>“Are you here because you’re about to elope with this guy? After robbing me of my money that’s like my blood?”</p>
<p>Owen said this as he brushed off the dirt on the hem of his clothes.</p>
<p>As if he didn’t care at all what kind of reactions Cassion and Diana had.</p>
<p>“I’ll say this again. I didn’t steal your money. Something like that is your specialty, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’m right. All this time, you’ve been selling me fake medicine while tricking me into thinking it’s real medicine. Didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Diana growled icily at Owen and, in an instant, his expression froze.</p>
<p>However, it stopped there. Just an instant.</p>
<p>His hardened expression eased up and his lips soon opened with a, ‘Hahaha!’ He laughed riotously at her face.</p>
<p>Even his goons behind him giggled and laughed along with him.</p>
<p>Seeing this unpleasant sight, Cassion glanced down at them.</p>
<p>Owen guffawed with his mouth wide open and while clapping his hands together.</p>
<p>“Ahaha! And I was wondering why our dear Young Miss ran away… But I get it now, I get why you ran away.”</p>
<p>The man’s impudence made Diana clench her hands into fists.</p>
<p>“So you’re admitting to it? That you gave a child fake medicine?!”</p>
<p>When Diana yelled out in frustration, Owen responded by covering his ears. He then picked out one ear with a pinky finger, blew on it, then continued speaking calmly.</p>
<p>“Ah, don’t shout. It’s noisy. And really though, it’s thanks to me that your sister got a little better, right?”</p>
<p>Since she’s going to die anyway, it’s best to let her die comfortably.</p>
<p>He added the insinuating whisper was meant to provoke her, as though it was a small spark being ignited upon dry firewood.</p>
<p>“Son of a…”</p>
<p>With a cold expression, Diana reached into her chest pocket.</p>
<p>It was to find the weapon she always carried with her.</p>
<p>However, it’s a fact that Owen and his lackeys had spent a long time working together with Diana.</p>
<p>So of course, they knew what she was trying to do right now.</p>
<p>Owen chuckled as he backed away.</p>
<p>“Oh goodness, I’m so sca—”</p>
<p>The man had backed away, but only to make a show out of it, and he spoke sarcastically at her—yet couldn’t finish what he was saying.</p>
<p>To be more exact, his mouth got shut for him.</p>
<p>But instead of it being Diana, as she was still reaching into her pocket, Cassion, who was next to her, smacked the man right across the cheek.</p>
<p>Slap—!</p>
<p>Owen’s head jerked to the side with a blunt sound.</p>
<p>Trickle.</p>
<p>All he could feel was a certain throbbing, then down came a trickle from his nose.</p>
<p>Soon—drip, drip—more drops of bright red blood fell to the ground.</p>
<p>With a numb, paralyzing sensation to his head, Owen stood there in a daze, blinking as he looked to the side.</p>
<p>There was a look of horror on his face, but Cassion, the person who had stricken the man, remained calm.</p>
<p>“Diana, calm down.”</p>
<p>On the contrary, even after hitting someone like that, he was even calming someone else down with a relaxed voice. Diana was incensed beside him.</p>
<p>Diana glared at Cassion, who tried to mollify her.</p>
<p>How can I stay calm when I’m absolutely livid, huh. This was what her glare was saying.</p>
<p>Understanding this as they made eye contact, Cassion leaned down and whispered.</p>
<p>“You’re not alone anymore. Don’t bear with your resentment alone.”</p>
<p>At the gentle whisper, Diana’s pupils shook.</p>
<p>She turned away to look into the distance, then she bowed her head.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s as he said.</p>
<p>She was not alone.</p>
<p>Right now, she had a colleague beside her who could help her exact her vengeance, and there was also a ducal princess willingly said that she would provide her shelter.</p>
<p>Diana’s brown eyes scanned through the air, looking for something.</p>
<p>At the mouth of the riverbank, there where the logs were piled up.</p>
<p>All she could see were those piles of logs, but Diana knew who was there beyond.</p>
<p>Her shelter. Her guardian. Her lady.</p>
<p>‘Yeah, the reliable person on my side is over there… Let’s not get too worked up.’</p>
<p>The anger that had soared to the top of her head was as sweltering as lava. However, she didn’t want to show an ugly appearance to the ducal princess.</p>
<p>Stay cool, stay relaxed.</p>
<p>Diana tried to cool her head, then after, she looked at Owen. He was still frozen in place, standing there in a strange posture.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Owen’s head also slowly faced forward.</p>
<p>His movements were awkward, as though he was a rusty gate.</p>
<p>You could practically hear him screeching.</p>
<p>The sight of two streams of red blood from his nostrils and down to his lips was worth seeing.</p>
<p>Owen stared back at Diana and Cassion dazedly, and after, his chin slowly began to shake.</p>
<p>The crimson stream reached his dark neck.</p>
<p>A reddish hue also started coloring his skin, climbing to make even his face bright red.</p>
<p>His face was so red that it felt like they were looking at an open flame.</p>
<p>“W-W…Why you!”</p>
<p>That’s all Owen said. Then, he beckoned to his lackeys.</p>
<p>Even while stunned and nervous, the men reacted to Owen’s signal and immediately pounced at the two.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Blunt sounds quietly echoed across the riverbank.</p>
<p>Beneath the bleak sky, seven men versus one pair of a man and a woman were entangled in a fight.</p>
<p>Seeing them up close was frightening.</p>
<p>However, those who were sitting far away, behind the logs, watched the scene leisurely and didn’t feel any danger at all.</p>
<p>Somehow, it wasn’t a matter of proximity, but a matter of who exactly those people were.</p>
<p>The people sitting behind the log piles were me, Blanca and Logan.</p>
<p>‘I guess that duo isn’t all that brutal.’</p>
<p>Rather, as we stayed back without helping, I knew that things would get bloodier if this side, including me, were to join in.</p>
<p>“Aww, he missed. If you miss like that, how will you go on?”</p>
<p>In fact, it’s enough to think that Blanca would be more ferocious out there, seeing how she made such a comment with a glint in her eyes.</p>
<p>Flipping through the fake bills in an indifferent manner, Logan was the same.</p>
<p>I leaned over with one elbow on a pile of logs while propping up my chin on that hand, observing Cassion and Diana’s movements.</p>
<p>I was worried about them getting overpowered, but they took the lead much easier than I expected of them.</p>
<p>What’s this, they’re making me proud.</p>
<p>‘My kids grew up so fast.’</p>
<p>With that kind of feeling.</p>
<p>My gaze towards Cassion and Diana flashed with a bit of satisfaction, but then one bulky log got flung through the air.</p>
<p>“Aaaargh!”</p>
<p>There was a man who tried to sneak up on Diana and Cassion with a blunt weapon, but he instead let out a pained groan because he got hit by that log.</p>
<p>Well, maybe rather than a groan, he let out something close to an anguished scream instead.</p>
<p>“…What did you just do?”</p>
<p>Logan asked me, baffled.</p>
<p>It’s beyond me why he had such a look on his face.</p>
<p>Shrugging my shoulders, I replied casually.</p>
<p>“I mean, that guy was sneaking up on them from behind, you know. Shouldn’t I help a bit?”</p>
<p>Since this was a real, hands-on experience, it would be great if they could work this out on their own, but…</p>
<p>If I’m going to raise those kids up to be strong, I can’t exactly let them get their heads bashed, now can I?</p>
<p>Unconvinced by my explanation, Logan shook his head. Then, as he recalled something, he opened his lips again.</p>
<p>“By chance, is it allowed to throw just anything with that much force?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about just any other thing, but… For the most part, until the point of memory loss is fine.”</p>
<p>“Alright, good to hear. Then, shall I poison them to induce a bit of memory loss? I think that’s a good step to protecting ourselves, too.”</p>
<p>Hm?</p>
<p>I don’t know how he came to that kind of conclusion. Even so, the look in Logan’s eyes was sincere.</p>
<p>I looked to the side at Blanca and wordlessly asked just what kind of development was this now.</p>
<p>Perhaps because she had already shown her face to me so she had her veil pulled up, but…</p>
<p>With her silver eyes curved into arcs, she answered.</p>
<p>“Logan’s specialty is making poison, you see.”</p>
<p>Ah, so that’s it.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the answer I wanted to hear, but this enough was an interesting piece of new information.</p>
<p>‘Then in the original novel, did Logan make that poison?’</p>
<p>It’s only natural to come to this conclusion. But as I thought until here, another question arose.</p>
<p>For example, Logan’s job description and specialty were two different things.</p>
<p>“Logan is a doctor though.”</p>
<p>Doctors were supposed to heal illnesses, yet poison was a cause of such illnesses.</p>
<p>It didn’t make sense to give both the illness and the medicine. Wasn’t it strange to do both at the same time?</p>
<p>“The process of making medicine and poison is similar. The knowledge to save someone can also be used to kill someone, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that…”</p>
<p>Actually makes sense.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I know someone similar from my second transmigration.</p>
<p>Among my brothers who were sage transcendentals, there was one who was adept in handling both poison and medicine.</p>
<p>He could make deadly poisons, but at the same time, he also made miraculous elixirs.</p>
<p>After drinking such a thing, if your pressure points could also be dealt well, then it’s possible to massively improve one’s own inner strength with just that elixir.</p>
<p>‘Yeah, I’ve learned a thing or two as well.’</p>
<p>The recipes to those kinds of elixirs were usually kept secret. And because the way to make it was just in that one particular way, not just anyone could successfully make it.</p>
<p>However, he taught me how to make some of them.</p>
<p>I don’t exactly know why he did, but if I had to come up with a reason…</p>
<p>‘Maybe because he pitied me? If not, then I wonder if it’s because of a main character buff.’</p>
<p>That’s the best reason I could think of. Anyway, I forgot about it because I didn’t have a need for the elixir in the third transmigration.</p>
<p>Now though, it might be helpful to have it on hand.</p>
<p>For myself. Or perhaps, for Cassion.</p>
<p>“If you make the poison… Then you can make the medicine for it too, can’t you?”</p>
<p>When I asked Logan, he nodded back.</p>
<p>“Well, it’s not outside my skill set.”</p>
<p>“Oh, then there’s something I’ll ask you to make later, so can you make that medicine for me?”</p>
<p>Of course, the elixirs that’ll be made would be limited.</p>
<p>Since the worldbuilding here was vastly different, there’s naturally many ingredients that didn’t exist in this world.</p>
<p>However, there were certainly things that did.</p>
<p>Although an elixir that would be made with much rarer ingredients would work better, still, elixir was elixir.</p>
<p>For a moment, Logan didn’t answer.</p>
<p>He glanced sideways at Blanca.</p>
<p>Just like a cat making a probing glance towards its owner.</p>
<p>Blanca only smiled without answering verbally. A momentary flash of exhaustion appeared on Logan’s expression, but after that, he carefully asked one question.</p>
<p>“It’s not some strange medicine, is it?”</p>
<p>“Do I seem like a person who’d ask for such a thing?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>…Yeah, I do seem like that kind of person. Isn’t this a bit regrettable? A moment of silence passed over.</p>
<p>Pfft.</p>
<p>But it was soon broken as Blanca giggled.</p>
<p>Trying and failing to hold back her laughter, Blanca’s lips trembled in her mirth.</p>
<p>Logan’s silence looked like a positive sign.</p>
<p>I glanced at her for a second, then I turned to Logan again.</p>
<p>Hesitating for one moment more, he eventually nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, if that’s the case, well… I’ll try to make it.”</p>
<p>“This sounds fun. If you need any ingredients, I’ll prepare them all for you. In return, please show me the medicine once it’s done, yes?”</p>
<p>When Logan answered, Blanca added this.</p>
<p>I said yes since I was going to ask Blanca to get the ingredients anyway.</p>
<p>I’m feeling quite satisfied.</p>
<p>Like an ox that took one step back and caught a mouse in the process.</p>
<p>‘It would be really nice if we can successfully make the elixir…’</p>
<p>With this thought in mind, I slowly turned my attention back towards Cassion.</p>
<p>t/n: sage transcendental: a sagely person who, through meditation or some zen-like cultivation, has reached the highest point of purity, becoming sort of a demi-god figure with extraordinary powers. these beings usually dwell deep in the forest or mountains, away from civilization, and far out of reach of earthly matters.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 66</p>
<p>While we were immersed in our conversation about poison, medicine making and medical practices, the situation got sorted out over there at that side, too.</p>
<p>Two of the five men had already collapsed, now rolling on the ground, while the remaining three were breathing roughly.</p>
<p>Diana and Cassion also looked disheveled, but they seemed to have sustained only a few injuries.</p>
<p>From an outsider’s point of view, there was no doubt that those two were far superior to the rest.</p>
<p>Even the guildmaster, Owen, seemed to be feeling the weight of defeat on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He tried to catch his breath a short distance away while his face was as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>Right about now, he’s probably thinking that there’s no hope in winning this.</p>
<p>‘I mean, that’s why you should live kindly while you’re alive.’</p>
<p>In the original novel though, the protagonists didn’t have roles that were on the side of righteousness.</p>
<p>And the villains like me and Cassion died futile deaths.</p>
<p>I mean, come to think of it, this kind of correlation was a bit strange.</p>
<p>Because in the genre of a novel like this, it’s the protagonists who were much crazier than the villains themselves.</p>
<p>I watched Cassion and Diana as I apathetically mulled over the novel’s ‘good’ and ‘evil’.</p>
<p>“Hm, I think they’ve gotten things sorted out now.”</p>
<p>A murmur could be heard from beside me.</p>
<p>It was Blanca.</p>
<p>Gracefully bobbing one crossed leg as she sat there, Blanca asked.</p>
<p>“This money… what’ll you do with it?”</p>
<p>Her silver eyes twirled as she pointed to the box beneath her feet.</p>
<p>It was the money that the men brought in earlier and handed to Logan.</p>
<p>The box of 1000 gold was Blanca’s in the first place, so she should just take it.</p>
<p>The dilemma now lay with the 520 gold that Owen brought.</p>
<p>This was probably those men’s entire fortune.</p>
<p>As the corners of my lips curled up, I answered.</p>
<p>With my eyes still fixed on Cassion and Diana.</p>
<p>“It’ll be split into three. One-third will be given to our poor Marie since she never got her severance pay. One-third to you as your commission fee. And the remainder will be for Cassion to use as his funds.”</p>
<p>I answered in a very casual tone, and Blanca admired this as she spoke amusedly.</p>
<p>“You got this money by swindling someone, but you don’t seem to have any reservations about using it.”</p>
<p>It was an ambiguous remark that could either be a compliment or otherwise. But, it didn’t really bother me.</p>
<p>“It’s money scammed from a scammer, so whatever.”</p>
<p>Just as Blanca said, this money was gained from duping someone.</p>
<p>I don’t even know if there really is such a thing as a treasure ship of some foreign nation’s imperial family, but the backstory about the shipwreck was believable enough.</p>
<p>To prevent them from wising up to it, the date was set just two days after the request to their guild had been deliberately placed.</p>
<p>And those men took the bait—hook, line and sinker.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was all one big fishing ruse.</p>
<p>I had their movements tracked for these two days, and they seemed to have withdrawn all the money that they had.</p>
<p>This box of 520 gold coins was the culmination of all their money, all their greed, and all their sins.</p>
<p>I reached for one gold coin.</p>
<p>Gold coins at daybreak had no difference with ice-cold metal.</p>
<p>Stroking the cold surface of the gold coin, I asked back.</p>
<p>“Then, do you care?”</p>
<p>I glanced to the side.</p>
<p>And my gaze was met by a pair of mysterious silver eyes.</p>
<p>As she blinked, her long eyelashes fluttered, and her eyes curled into smooth arcs.</p>
<p>“This is why I like you, Princess.”</p>
<p>I believe there’s no other more dreadfully ridiculous answer than that.</p>
<p>Then, still with a smile on her lips, she spoke with a hum towards Logan.</p>
<p>“Logan, you’ve prepared the documentations detailing those guys’ past, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve gathered pieces of evidence of their illegal activities and left them behind in their hideout. Once an investigation commences, they’ll be found immediately.”</p>
<p>“Then, once the evidence is found, you will be the one who’ll press charges, right?”</p>
<p>The conversation turned to me.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’ve already contacted my older brother, so the guards should be on their way now.”</p>
<p>Before Cassion and I arrived here, I sent a letter to my older brother.</p>
<p>The loyal coachman, our dear Melvin, went back to the ducal estate no questions asked.</p>
<p>The carriage was empty except for the single letter it was carrying.</p>
<p>I’m glad I brought him over to my side, too.</p>
<p>‘I couldn’t use Blanca’s side and the hotel for this task…’</p>
<p>If I had, then a carrier bird would have been sent.</p>
<p>The one advantage to a carrier bird was that it’s faster than a carriage, but considering today’s events, this was actually a drawback.</p>
<p>The work we had today was dedicated to Cassion’s hands-on training. But of course, the more important task today was for Diana to carry out her revenge.</p>
<p>Thus, Diana would have to deal with those guys herself, however…</p>
<p>‘The fact that Diana can wield a sword—this has to stay a secret.’</p>
<p>The more an important card was kept hidden, the more it would shine.</p>
<p>If need be, Diana would be affixed to Alicia’s side as her escort. It would be better if her abilities could be kept secret.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be difficult if the guards would come too early.</p>
<p>At the very least, they should come here after Diana had already beaten them up into a pulp.</p>
<p>In the letter I sent to my brother, I wrote:</p>
<p>[ My beloved personal maid had been swindled by a suspicious guild.</p>
<p>I want to help her so I decided to investigate the matter, and I found out that they’re vicious criminals, and that they’re planning to defect from the empire today.</p>
<p>That’s why Maxwell and I are in a hurry to stay on their tail right now. Please send the guards. ]</p>
<p>I didn’t care very much for the cover story, but there shouldn’t be anything suspicious about it.</p>
<p>“You got rid of all the evidence incriminating Diana as someone who once worked in that guild, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’ve taken care of everything. All the traces left of her there was about Diana being a ‘victim of fraud’, nothing more and nothing less.”</p>
<p>Logan replied.</p>
<p>He reported in a very business-like tone, and that just made him more trustworthy in that regard.</p>
<p>And also, this incident would be used to tell the guards how Maxwell overpowered the culprits.</p>
<p>That way, Damian and Duke Valentine would acknowledge Cassion a little more.</p>
<p>Besides that, this would also instill a sense of urgency in David.</p>
<p>All of that was happening at the same time here.</p>
<p>“I believe we should get going now. The situation over there seems to have been sorted out for the most part, too.”</p>
<p>Blanca whispered to me.</p>
<p>Indeed, it was as she said. Right now, there was no one else standing around Cassion and Diana.</p>
<p>All five of those men, well, they’re just rolling around on the ground.</p>
<p>“S…Save… me…”</p>
<p>While bleeding through both nostrils still, Owen groaned.</p>
<p>His face got mangled quite considerably.</p>
<p>Blue, and also red.</p>
<p>It’s as if he’s covered in fireworks.</p>
<p>“…Ugh… Please… We used to be… co-workers… right? Dia…na…”</p>
<p>Diana glanced down on him as she tried to catch her breath. Then, with a calm tone, she spoke.</p>
<p>“The guards will be here soon. Your crimes will be exposed, and you’ll be thrown in jail.”</p>
<p>For a moment, the air around them was frozen silent.</p>
<p>Owen looked up at Diana with bloodshot eyes, but his lips distorted into a smile as he clung onto her ankle.</p>
<p>“If… so, then, isn’t that… isn’t that dangerous for you, too? You also worked in our guild… Did you forget?”</p>
<p>The man’s threats made Diana breathe out heavily.</p>
<p>Her breaths were so deep that her shoulders and chest moved in unison.</p>
<p>Then soon, she lightly kicked off the man’s hand.</p>
<p>“Yeah, you all worked me like a dog. I wasn’t treated like a human being, I couldn’t beat you all up, I couldn’t scream out even once, and while I’m not being paid properly so I could pay off my debt, the interest also kept rising. Apart from that, the medicine that I used to consider like a ray of light… was fake.”</p>
<p>As soon as she stopped speaking, heated tears flowed down from Diana’s eyes.</p>
<p>Her emotions were surging up.</p>
<p>Blanca, Logan and I watched Diana from the sidelines with bated breath.</p>
<p>For a moment, Diana’s tearful gaze turned this way.</p>
<p>While bravely wiping away her tears with the hem of one sleeve, she smiled.</p>
<p>And it felt like that smile was intended for me.</p>
<p>“What a shame, but I’m not going to get caught here.”</p>
<p>Her voice was quiet, but so full of confidence.</p>
<p>Then, her gaze slowly turned away from me and went back towards that man.</p>
<p>“From now on, I also have someone on my side who’s protecting me.”</p>
<p>Her voice shook with emotion, with tears, that I was at a loss for words for a moment as I heard the confidence and joy in her tone.</p>
<p>It must be because there was a subtle sense of guilt mixed in. After all, I took her in while planning to take advantage of her.</p>
<p>I’d have been in trouble if she was on Leo’s side, so I instead took her on my side to use her.</p>
<p>If I were to be honest, this idea continued to remain on the back of my mind to this day.</p>
<p>That I’d be sure to make the most out of her.</p>
<p>However, not without proper compensation.</p>
<p>‘If I’m someone on your side who’s protecting you, then of course that’s what I have to do.’</p>
<p>Saying this to myself in my mind, I slowly rose from my seat.</p>
<p>Logan and Blanca’s gazes followed my movement.</p>
<p>This made Blanca smile pleasantly at me.</p>
<p>“Well, we’ll be on our way now. We still need to hide some money.”</p>
<p>“Sure. Thank you for your help today.”</p>
<p>“No need for thanks. I’m getting paid for all this after all.”</p>
<p>There was a mischievous smile on her lips as she waved goodbye.</p>
<p>After nodding, Logan followed after her.</p>
<p>It was his way of saying bye.</p>
<p>I raised my eyebrows to answer him, then I stepped away.</p>
<p>Cassion and Diana.</p>
<p>Towards where they were now.</p>
<p>“Pri… Milady.”</p>
<p>As I approached, Diana and Cassion blinked as they glanced over to me.</p>
<p>I made eye contact with them both, one after another, then kicked the sprawled man right in the crotch.</p>
<p>“Uu…uugh…huuhp…”</p>
<p>The man let out a shriek, a groan, then eventually a sound that was somewhere in between those two.</p>
<p>As he curled into himself so tightly like that, the sight of him like that expressed just how much pain he was in.</p>
<p>“Does it hurt?”</p>
<p>“Kk…kkuhhk…”</p>
<p>The man couldn’t even answer and just kept croaking like that.</p>
<p>The quivering man barely flipped over so that he could look at me.</p>
<p>The whites of his eyes had turned red.</p>
<p>“Y…Y…You’re…”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>It looked like he wanted to say more than just the word ‘you’re’, but I had a vague guess on what it was.</p>
<p>Just seeing the color of my eyes would certainly make someone ask, ‘You’re House Valentine’s young lady?’</p>
<p>After cutting off the man’s words, I slowly crouched down to look into Owen’s eyes.</p>
<p>And with a beaming smile, I introduced myself to him.</p>
<p>“I’m Diana’s guardian. So just try to mess with Diana one more time. If you do, then I won’t just send you to jail. You’ll be going straight to hell.”</p>
<p>In its own way, it was quite the courteous self-introduction.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 67</p>
<p>While glancing down at Owen and his posse, I dusted off my hands.</p>
<p>Right now, they were all scattered here and there on the ground, unconscious.</p>
<p>For as much as Owen prattled on while begging for his life, I hit him on a pressure point just to shut him up and render him unconscious.</p>
<p>Just in time, the sound of heavy footsteps could be heard some distance away.</p>
<p>‘The guards must be coming.’</p>
<p>Diana furtively glanced at me and made eye contact, then she hid herself.</p>
<p>She was currently disguised as an ordinary maid, so it would put her in a difficult spot if she’s seen wearing clothes that were stained with dirt and blood.</p>
<p>So now the current situation could be seen as this—that only Cassion and I were the ones who confronted the Black Lion Guild.</p>
<p>“Are you alright? Are you hurt anywhere?”</p>
<p>With those footsteps in the background, I asked this question to Cassion.</p>
<p>But instead of answering right away, he gave that rare smile that made him look so boyish.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I didn’t roll on the ground.”</p>
<p>He answered playfully, but I could see that his words contained his sincere pride.</p>
<p>Anyway, he’d show that cute side of him from time to time.</p>
<p>While he stood tall, there was a triumphant look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yup, you were so cool.”</p>
<p>But when I said this, his boyish expression hardened. He turned his head to the side awkwardly as though he was a broken machine.</p>
<p>“Cassion?”</p>
<p>I grabbed hold of his arm as he turned away, but he didn’t answer.</p>
<p>All he did was to turn his head further and used his other hand to touch the back of his neck.</p>
<p>…This, maybe.</p>
<p>“Are you being shy?”</p>
<p>I did ask, but I didn’t really need to hear the answer. He was obviously feeling bashful right now.</p>
<p>His earlobes were red, and even the back of his neck was red…</p>
<p>Don’t tell me. You were complimented with only one mention of you being ‘cool’, but then you got this embarrassed?</p>
<p>I wanted to tease him even more, but I had to stop myself because the rumbling footsteps were getting closer.</p>
<p>“Even if you’re feeling embarrassed, let’s pay attention now. The guards will be here soon.”</p>
<p>With my last word being a warning instead of a teasing joke, I stood up.</p>
<p>And acted as though I’d been waiting for the guards all this time.</p>
<p>However, a strange thought suddenly occurred to me.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it a bit… too loud?</p>
<p>Only five arrests would be made, so at most, only ten guards would have sufficed.</p>
<p>Then again, the approaching footsteps sounded to be much more than just ten people.</p>
<p>I don’t know if that loud sound was caused by horses’ hooves maybe, but while I was thinking that this was much too excessive,</p>
<p>I heard someone calling me.</p>
<p>“Rosetta!”</p>
<p>My eyes widened as I heard the voice of a totally unexpected person.</p>
<p>Soon enough, the approaching crowd began to appear.</p>
<p>As it’s already been guessed, the number of people was well over ten.</p>
<p>And at the head of that group was the owner of the voice that had just called out to me, riding a horse while he had a grave expression on his face.</p>
<p>“…Brother?”</p>
<p>It was Damian.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He, who was at the very front of the group, jumped off his horse as soon as he found me.</p>
<p>He landed on the ground hastily and soon strode forward. He looked like a boar rushing forward.</p>
<p>“Br—”</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Now standing in front of me, Damian yelled out the question right at me, his composure completely gone from his demeanor.</p>
<p>Rather than raising his voice in anger, it seemed like his voice was laced with concern.</p>
<p>I nodded back wordlessly.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect Damian to come here in person, to be honest, so I’m a bit taken aback.</p>
<p>“I’m fine, Brother… But what brings you…”</p>
<p>“You sent me a letter. You said that there are criminals in this place.”</p>
<p>Yeah, I did say that in the letter.</p>
<p>Right. That’s really what I said, but…</p>
<p>When he put it that way, didn’t the nuance sound kind of strange?</p>
<p>It sounds almost as if I got kidnapped or something.</p>
<p>“To be more precise, the swindlers were trying to escape, that’s why I asked for the guards as reinforcements.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I brought the guards with me.”</p>
<p>“…It doesn’t look like you’ve towed along only guards…”</p>
<p>I glanced over to the pack of people behind him. A rough estimate tells me that’s a group of more or less fifty people.</p>
<p>Some of them looked like guards, but most were wearing what seemed to be the armor of the duchy’s knighthood.</p>
<p>My head started to throb.</p>
<p>I mean, there’s only five people here who need to be caught, but I didn’t know he’d bring this many people.</p>
<p>As I sighed at the serious atmosphere surrounding the knights, Damian carefully spoke up.</p>
<p>“I brought some knights with me just in case you might have gotten swept into a dangerous situation. I’m glad you’re not hurt.”</p>
<p>“…Ah, yes. Um… Maxwell protected me, so I’m safe.”</p>
<p>I answered in this way, subtly praising Maxwell.</p>
<p>When compliments flowed in this way, that’s when they felt the most sincere.</p>
<p>Damian scanned me over to check my condition again. Then, his golden eyes shifted to the side of me.</p>
<p>There, where Cassion was standing.</p>
<p>“Maxwell.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Duke.”</p>
<p>A stern call was followed by a stern answer.</p>
<p>Damian looked over at Cassion and the collapsed men scattered around us. Then, he spoke.</p>
<p>“You’re still only a temporary knight, but you did well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I just did my job.”</p>
<p>Cassion replied in quite a shameless manner towards Damian’s compliment.</p>
<p>I kept my expression serious while secretly holding back a smile.</p>
<p>As if to encourage Cassion, Damian gave two pats on Cassion’s arm.</p>
<p>Then, after saying that he was looking forward to good results on the day of the match, he moved away.</p>
<p>This wasn’t such a bad outcome.</p>
<p>After that, the situation was quickly sorted out.</p>
<p>Those men were caught and the news came out that they found evidence at the Black Lion Guild’s hideout.</p>
<p>Diana’s pouch of gold coins became evidence because it was determined that they were about to use it as funds to defect to another country.</p>
<p>All I was left to do from that point on was to look around in a relaxed manner, then I planned to go back home when I found the right time.</p>
<p>‘Well, I thought it would go that way…’</p>
<p>But why were we in this carriage together?</p>
<p>Just the two of us.</p>
<p>In that carriage ride back home.</p>
<p>I glanced towards the person sitting opposite me.</p>
<p>Damian must have felt my stare, so his previously lowered gaze turned up and met my eyes.</p>
<p>It was so quiet in that carriage where there’s only the two of us, and the awkwardness was even more enhanced when our eyes met.</p>
<p>Even so, I had no choice but to maintain eye contact even though I didn’t really have anything to say. The atmosphere would turn even stranger if I looked away here.</p>
<p>But in the midst of the heavy silence, it was Damian who opened his lips first.</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>At his brief call, I answered with a nod.</p>
<p>Damian hesitated for a moment, but then he soon spoke again with that distinctly stern, characteristically strained expression.</p>
<p>“I know you don’t have any faith in me. In the first place, I never trusted you either, so this is the inevitable result.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>The abrupt self-confession—or, perhaps something close to a confession—made me ask back in surprise, looking up.</p>
<p>A rather sorrowful golden gaze was turned to me, but it soon disappeared behind the eyelids that slowly closed.</p>
<p>“But, even with that, can’t you rely on me a little more?”</p>
<p>“I left it to you to call in the guards though?”</p>
<p>“Before that, you could have entrusted this whole affair to me, right? Don’t jump straight into such a dangerous situation.”</p>
<p>His mouth closed shut once more after the earnest voice leaked out. I knew what he was trying to say.</p>
<p>Even so, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>Today’s goal was Diana’s revenge and Cassion’s hands-on training, so I couldn’t ask him for help.</p>
<p>Still though, this was my own situation.</p>
<p>Damian didn’t know the story behind it, so I seemed like a pitiful person who’s running around, doing reckless things without asking for help.</p>
<p>I remained silent. His fluttering eyelids slowly lifted.</p>
<p>“You… can ask me for help more. Give me a chance.”</p>
<p>While Damian said this, it looked to me like he was on the verge of tears.</p>
<p>I looked at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p>I felt my head gradually become icy.</p>
<p>I found the man in front of me pitiful, but at the same time, my rationality ran cold.</p>
<p>‘This guy, seriously. He never gets tired.’</p>
<p>Was there any end to that guilt?</p>
<p>Well, I was in the kind of position to take advantage of that guilt, so I shouldn’t complain.</p>
<p>Still, it was much too pitiful.</p>
<p>The real one wasn’t here anyway. Inside Rosetta’s body right now was me, a ‘fake’.</p>
<p>It was pitiful to think that he was endlessly begging for forgiveness from a fake.</p>
<p>And it was pitiful Rosetta, too, wouldn’t be able to hear that forgiveness.</p>
<p>For a moment, I glanced down at Damian with eyes full of frost, but I soon averted my gaze and looked out the carriage window.</p>
<p>“Don’t do that so much, please.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ve told you time and again. You don’t have to pay any attention to me. Just take care of Alicia.”</p>
<p>Or by chance, later.</p>
<p>Don’t regret it.</p>
<p>At the murmured words, Damian’s face turned pale.</p>
<p>Instead of observing his reaction more, I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>Perhaps I said too much, or perhaps I said all that for myself.</p>
<p>Somehow, it seemed like Damian had made up his mind to treat me like family from now on—that it was a vow that he had already committed to.</p>
<p>If he continued to hope for something that truly wouldn’t work out in the end, wasn’t he the one who’d be laughable, the one who’d be pitiful?</p>
<p>I cannot have any family.</p>
<p>I’ve already decided on this long ago.</p>
<p>When, during the third transmigration, Rita’s mother noticed that I wasn’t the real ‘Rita’.</p>
<p>When the whole family learned the truth, blamed me, broke my heart, and slowly, steadily, resigned themselves.</p>
<p>When those poor, pitiful people lost their lives because of me, who wasn’t even the true ‘Rita’.</p>
<p>That was the time I made up my mind.</p>
<p>Having a family was nothing but deceit.</p>
<p>Towards the owner of the body, towards the family, towards everyone.</p>
<p>As long as I could remember those people, who had gotten distorted, who fell to ruin, I will not have any family.</p>
<p>For someone who doesn’t even remember her real name anymore, in the first place, something like one’s own roots should not exist.</p>
<p>It was basic courtesy.</p>
<p>And, it was a line of defense. For myself.</p>
<p>When I got caught. When they called me as they were dying.</p>
<p>That helplessness and that torment—they’re all still so vivid.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>I could not turn my eyes away any further, and so I watched the passing scenery out the window.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, fatigue settled upon me.</p>
<p>And what rose in return were memories of the past, as exhausting as digging up a scarce, dry well.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 68</p>
<p>It rained for a few days, but the skies had cleared up once again.</p>
<p>The mansion that momentarily sought peace recently found itself embroiled in activity.</p>
<p>Today was the day of the match between the commoner friend of the duke’s illegitimate daughter, and the rising star of the fourth knight order.</p>
<p>“Did you hear the news? They say that the commoner wiped out an entire shady guild all by himself.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Those guild members were all bloody when the guards took them in.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it’s true?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I think it is. I know someone from the third order who was dispatched along with the guards. He said that he saw it himself.”</p>
<p>Hah, my word.</p>
<p>It was hours before the start of the match.</p>
<p>Taking the day off for the special event, the knights gathered in twos or threes and talked about ‘Maxwell’.</p>
<p>What circulated was the story about the ignored street rat, who wiped out multiple enemies alone.</p>
<p>“Then the match later… Maybe it’s actually worth watching?”</p>
<p>“I know right. I thought Maxwell would get owned in less than a minute.”</p>
<p>“At this rate, maybe… David’s going to lose?”</p>
<p>After someone carefully uttered their guess, a moment of silence stretched out.</p>
<p>Then, after that pause, people began to laugh one by one.</p>
<p>Their laughter was either incredulous about it happening or mirthful at the thought that it might.</p>
<p>These guffaws and chuckles were contagious amidst the crowd.</p>
<p>They all went on their way to find seats for the match that would start in a few hours.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, behind a tree, there was one particular person who heard the entire conversation.</p>
<p>That is, the subject of the conversation himself.</p>
<p>David.</p>
<p>“This… goddamn…”</p>
<p>He cursed furiously while suppressing the volume of his voice. One clenched fist hit the trunk he was leaning against behind him.</p>
<p>There was a glint in his brown eyes.</p>
<p>‘Why the hell am I hearing this ridiculous nonsense.’</p>
<p>Even if they just said that he might lose to that street rat as a joke, David was enraged.</p>
<p>He wanted to step out of the shadows and turn the place upside down, but he had to save his energy right before the match.</p>
<p>“Those morons just heard stupid rumors like that and came here, but…”</p>
<p>No matter who looked at it, they were so unsightly with how they believed in false rumors so easily.</p>
<p>These guys are just spineless, that’s why they believe it.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand, it’s also true that David felt some anxiety.</p>
<p>What if those ridiculous rumors were true?</p>
<p>What if Maxwell’s skills were better than he assumed?</p>
<p>So if it’s as those guys said… and he’s the one who’d lose…</p>
<p>‘No. Impossible.’</p>
<p>As he speculated and came to this conclusion, apprehension flooded in.</p>
<p>He tried to calm himself by clenching and unclenching his fists.</p>
<p>‘I heard that the shady guild’s name is the Black Lion Guild…’</p>
<p>Now that he thought of it, he somehow felt that the name was familiar. He might have heard it somewhere.</p>
<p>But when he wracked his mind, nothing exactly came up.</p>
<p>‘Maybe it’s just a feeling.’</p>
<p>There were still a few hours until the match began.</p>
<p>To shake off this odd sense of déjà vu and his soaring anxiety, David headed towards the training grounds.</p>
<p>He was thinking about loosening up there.</p>
<p>No matter what, a perfect mental and physical condition would lead him to the perfect victory he needed.</p>
<p>To quell those rising rumors, he had to throw that commoner’s face to the ground and take that place next to the ducal princess.</p>
<p>Against his expectations however, he couldn’t even reach his perfect condition before he arrived at the training grounds.</p>
<p>As his lips were twitching while greedily thinking about it on the way there, he met the very person he didn’t want to meet.</p>
<p>‘…Street rat.’</p>
<p>Seeing Cassion walking towards him, David gnashed his teeth together. His legs halted obliquely mid-step.</p>
<p>Cassion also stopped walking when he saw that David was glaring at him.</p>
<p>A little taller than the other man, Cassion looked down at David without a word.</p>
<p>In the silence between them, their gazes met in the air.</p>
<p>The first to avert his eyes was Cassion.</p>
<p>He looked away as if nothing happened, then walked past David.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>However, this act only ignited David’s rage.</p>
<p>‘Just because of those rumors— you think you can look down on me?’</p>
<p>It felt as if the other man’s characteristic nonchalance and relaxed attitude was deliberately being done to mock him.</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>
<p>David shouted at once and roughly snatched Cassion’s wrist.</p>
<p>Cassion passively stopped walking, then he turned around to face the person who called out to him. His black eyes looked straight at the hand over his wrist, gripping tightly.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>As the question was asked in a low voice, David laughed in vain.</p>
<p>“I heard a very interesting rumor about you.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“What was it? You took down a criminal guild all by yourself, or something… Ha, it’s not even funny.”</p>
<p>“Is that all you have to say?”</p>
<p>After listening to David’s sarcastic remarks wordlessly until now, Cassion asked calmly.</p>
<p>And David’s eyebrows suddenly distorted.</p>
<p>As if he’s some hotshot, as if nothing happened, he couldn’t stand looking at the guy act so nonchalant.</p>
<p>With his indignation rising even further, David’s breaths grew rougher. As the sound of his breathing became louder, so did his voice.</p>
<p>“Is that all I have to say? Who isn’t going to be infuriated when there’s a ridiculous rumor going around.”</p>
<p>Fuming, David roared at Cassion as he twisted the other man’s arm to pull him in.</p>
<p>Even though it was a bit painful, there was still not the slightest hint of agitation in Cassion’s demeanor.</p>
<p>His black eyes, entirely calm and collected, alternated between looking at David’s hand and face.</p>
<p>“It’s prohibited to lay a hand on your opponent before the match.”</p>
<p>“What? So are you threatening me now?”</p>
<p>Cassion spoke quietly, but David snorted back as though he’d heard a dull joke.</p>
<p>As he glanced down at David without saying a word, Cassion eventually put a hand over David’s wrist.</p>
<p>“No. I’m warning you.”</p>
<p>At the same time he said this, David’s wrist was caught in a tight grip.</p>
<p>“Uh—ack.”</p>
<p>The grip was so powerful that David let out a pained groan.</p>
<p>The hand that was on Cassion’s other wrist loosened helplessly.</p>
<p>But David’s wrist continued to stay in Cassion’s grip.</p>
<p>The hand caught by Cassion tried to flounder in the air, but before David knew it, it turned red and white.</p>
<p>“Le… Let go…”</p>
<p>David said so as it felt as if his wrist was about to be snapped off.</p>
<p>With clenched lips, he looked up at Cassion’s face, where a shadow was cast upon him beneath the sun.</p>
<p>Matching the shadows, the man’s black eyes stared back at him.</p>
<p>The still gaze and the pain in his wrist rendered his limbs numb.</p>
<p>He felt goosebumps rising over his skin.</p>
<p>Chills ran down his spine.</p>
<p>David gulped down his breath for a moment.</p>
<p>“Please… let go…”</p>
<p>Right after he said this, it’s as if the following action was the natural consequence.</p>
<p>Cassion stared at him and relaxed his grip.</p>
<p>David’s hand fell down as though it plunged.</p>
<p>As his blood flow suddenly returned, he felt a numb, tingling feeling going through his hand.</p>
<p>“You… You son of a…”</p>
<p>David grabbed his wrist and stuttered. Then, stretching his own wrist calmly, Cassion replied.</p>
<p>“It’s an exchange.”</p>
<p>Hah?</p>
<p>David felt wronged.</p>
<p>Exchange, he said. But there was a clear difference between that bastard’s wrist and David’s wrist.</p>
<p>There was a clear red mark on his, but wasn’t that guy’s wrist just fine?</p>
<p>David chewed on his lower lip.</p>
<p>It was the difference in their innate strengths. He felt another chill. And there was that rumor he heard earlier.</p>
<p>As his nerves were at their highest, he put it all together in his mind.</p>
<p>As David was engulfed in panic, Cassion opened his lips again.</p>
<p>“We’ve settled the score once, so please follow the rules from now on.”</p>
<p>“…Is this also a warning?”</p>
<p>Cradling his sore wrist, David asked back with his lips twitching.</p>
<p>Even in the face of fear, that insignificant pride of his couldn’t be extinguished.</p>
<p>Cassion shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>Then, in the same leisurely strides that David took earlier, Cassion approached David.</p>
<p>The height difference became starker because the distance between them was narrowed.</p>
<p>The man looking down lowered his gaze more, the man looking up craned his head more.</p>
<p>The atmosphere around them was like thin ice.</p>
<p>It felt as if even one dry gulp would be too loud, so he had to hold his breath.</p>
<p>The taller man’s lips slowly opened.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s a warning. Rules exist as they are meant to be kept. So that dangerous things can be prevented.”</p>
<p>The tone of his voice was exceedingly polite, but David knew that it was nothing short of a threat.</p>
<p>A warning that if he tried to do any nonsense one more time, something dangerous truly might happen.</p>
<p>“Ah, and.”</p>
<p>Cassion wasn’t done speaking. There was a menacing glint in his black eyes.</p>
<p>“Please be careful with your words, with that look in your eyes. That is, if you wish to continue having your senses of sight, hearing and taste in the future.”</p>
<p>A sense of mortification dawned upon David’s gaze.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something back, but he felt so humiliated by that bastard that he couldn’t even open his mouth.</p>
<p>“Ah, this is a threat.”</p>
<p>After adding this, Cassion stepped back.</p>
<p>With a casual salute, he walked past the stunned David.</p>
<p>No one held him back this time.</p>
<p>The person who was left behind just stood there with his two feet stuck on the ground, huffing and puffing.</p>
<p>“That goddamn bastard. Who exactly do you dare warn? And a threat?! Just wait and see. I’ll make you regret it.”</p>
<p>His voice, as he muttered under his breath, quivered.</p>
<p>His hands, clenched into fists, also shook severely.</p>
<p>“Ptui.”</p>
<p>David spat sharply down the ground and soon headed elsewhere.</p>
<p>He originally intended to head towards the training grounds, but that’s not the direction he was taking any longer.</p>
<p>Red flames of indignation and outrage flared over his brown pupils.</p>
<p>No matter what, he would definitely win this match.</p>
<p>The only thought that filled his mind was a crooked desire to win.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 69</p>
<p>A few hours later—</p>
<p>The match was just around the corner, and the sparring arena began to fill out.</p>
<p>An open match wasn’t common, so most of the knights gathered here today to watch.</p>
<p>Sitting at the upper balcony, Rosetta glanced down at the full crowd delightedly.</p>
<p>To be honest, she didn’t expect that the match would be held in such a wide arena, so she was a bit surprised, but…</p>
<p>‘Well, that’s that.’</p>
<p>The bigger the audience, the more fun the show would be.</p>
<p>“There’s so many people, Sister.”</p>
<p>And sitting next to Rosetta, Alicia spoke in a rather stiff voice.</p>
<p>Her bright eyes, reminiscent of sunlight, trembled faintly.</p>
<p>The original Rosetta and Alicia were far removed from any social activities.</p>
<p>Since they didn’t go out all that much, let alone to such events, she wasn’t used to seeing such a huge crowd.</p>
<p>Rosetta patted Alicia gently on the shoulder to soothe her.</p>
<p>“I know. That’s why Maxwell has to do well.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I’m sure he’ll win! Sister was the one who took him in, so I’m sure!”</p>
<p>Giggling at the gentle touch, Alicia responded to Rosetta’s concerns with an enthusiastic nod and a fist pump.</p>
<p>The way Alicia so firmly declared that he’d win made Rosetta laugh out loud.</p>
<p>Besides, why was it that her main reason for believing so much was because ‘Sister took him in’?</p>
<p>What nonsense.</p>
<p>Alicia’s cheeks flushed pink when Rosetta laughed.</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand why she was so delighted, but in any case, it felt nice to see that her older sister was laughing.</p>
<p>Rosetta laughed for a long time. Then, wiping a few drops of tears from the corner of her eyes, she stroked Alicia’s long hair.</p>
<p>The upper seats were under shade, but the bright sunlight on this summer day seeped in a little.</p>
<p>The summer sun’s rays went in through a gap and reached Alicia’s brilliant blonde hair, making it shine beautifully.</p>
<p>The strands of her hair that slipped through the fingers looked like gold thread.</p>
<p>“Alicia, what you said is right.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Just as you said, Maxwell is someone I took in, so he’ll definitely win.”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s playful whisper, Alicia nodded with a sparkle in her eyes.</p>
<p>Of course, Rosetta was nowhere near joking about this.</p>
<p>As the time of the match approached, the boisterous atmosphere of the arena slowly quieted down.</p>
<p>Just in time, Damian arrived and took the vacant seat at the upper balcony.</p>
<p>“Brother!”</p>
<p>“…You’ve arrived, Brother.”</p>
<p>Damian smiled affectionately at the greetings given to him one after another.</p>
<p>When he made eye contact with Rosetta however, his expression was a bit awkward.</p>
<p>He’s been that way ever since the day of Diana’s revenge.</p>
<p>It’s the first time they’re facing each other properly again ever since they talked in the carriage alone.</p>
<p>‘Or by chance, later. Don’t regret it.’</p>
<p>Since he heard such words, it’s normal to feel awkward.</p>
<p>Smiling happily, Alicia sat between the two.</p>
<p>Her older brother and older sister.</p>
<p>The two people who were more precious to her than anyone else.</p>
<p>Noticing this, Rosetta smiled and was the first to initiate conversation with Damian.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming here, Brother.”</p>
<p>As if nothing had happened between the two of them.</p>
<p>“It was a condition that I placed, so of course I have to see it personally.”</p>
<p>Damian also had no intention of bursting Alicia’s bubble of happiness, so he quickly schooled his features and replied to Rosetta.</p>
<p>At the warm exchange of words spoken at either side of her, Alicia smiled once more.</p>
<p>She imagined something as impossible as her older brother and older sister having a good sibling relationship.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, the face of one absent family member popped into her mind.</p>
<p>“Ah, Brother! Where’s Fa…ther?”</p>
<p>She asked in a slightly excited voice, but in response, Damian shook his head with a troubled expression.</p>
<p>At the negative response, Alicia’s shoulders drooped.</p>
<p>It would have been nice if their father came today so that the entire family was gathered together.</p>
<p>Damian’s large hand stroked the back of Alicia’s head to comfort her.</p>
<p>Watching the amiable brother and sister, Rosetta leaned on the armrest opposite the direction where Alicia was.</p>
<p>With her body leaning obliquely like this, she glanced sideways at the two other people.</p>
<p>‘…Yeah, that’s it.’</p>
<p>This was the sight she wanted.</p>
<p>With her gone, it was the picturesque sight of a perfect family.</p>
<p>Even if she wasn’t here, Alicia would have family left with her.</p>
<p>This was the suitable environment for a happy female lead.</p>
<p>Rosetta thought about the future as she turned away.</p>
<p>Her expression was nonchalant, but her gaze as she looked in the distance was subdued.</p>
<p>It was a fact that she herself didn’t notice.</p>
<p>Soon enough, it was time for the match.</p>
<p>Cassion and David, who had been waiting in their respective waiting rooms until now, arrived at the arena’s platform.</p>
<p>“Waaaaah!”</p>
<p>Resounding exclaims swept through the entire stadium.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since an open match was held.</p>
<p>One competitor was the rising star of the fourth order of the knights, while the other competitor was the main character of all the buzzing rumors going around these days.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s not as if those rumors had been exaggerated.</p>
<p>People didn’t know that however, so they were just looking forward to watching the match.</p>
<p>Such events that break away from the humdrum of everyday life would make anybody’s heart race.</p>
<p>Today’s main characters appeared at both ends of the arena, then stopped in the middle of the stadium.</p>
<p>They both bowed their heads, then they turned to look up at the upper seats.</p>
<p>Damian slowly rose to his feet.</p>
<p>The gentle smile he gave to Alicia and Rosetta earlier was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>Right now, the only side of him that could be seen was the cold, level-headed Young Duke of House Valentine.</p>
<p>Moving to the edge of the balcony, he placed both hands on the stone railing and looked at the two men who were bowing their heads in front of him, then his gaze lightly scanned the people who were sitting below at the audience seats of the stadium.</p>
<p>It was quiet everywhere.</p>
<p>To the point that not one word or breath could even be heard.</p>
<p>The audience was overwhelmed after just one look from that cold, golden gaze.</p>
<p>As the arena was brought to a hush, Damian’s eyes turned to the two main characters once more.</p>
<p>“Today’s swordsmanship match is held for the purpose of choosing the escort knight for Ducal Princess Rosetta Valentine.”</p>
<p>The serious voice echoed throughout the arena.</p>
<p>“David Valheim. Maxwell.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>David and Maxwell answered Damian’s call one after another.</p>
<p>“Your victory or defeat will be determined by either of the two conditions: that one would ‘abstain’ first, or that one would ‘reach the opponent’s vital point’ first. Do you have any objections?”</p>
<p>“None, sir!”</p>
<p>“None, sir.”</p>
<p>Damian nodded after hearing the firm answers.</p>
<p>“Then, I look forward to your match.”</p>
<p>After saying these last words, he turned around.</p>
<p>He raised his hand as a signal, then the man next to him blew the horn.</p>
<p>Ppa-ppa-ppa-pam—!</p>
<p>With that, the audience, which had been restrained thus far, let out their cheers that resounded across the arena.</p>
<p>David and Cassion lightly shook hands, then moved about five or six steps away from each other.</p>
<p>At last, a color-bearer stepped in front of the two while carrying a huge flag in his hands.</p>
<p>“Waaaaah!”</p>
<p>The more the flag fluttered, the louder the audience’s cheers became.</p>
<p>The two men drew their swords.</p>
<p>It was the start of the match to determine who would be Rosetta’s escort knight. Each side had no doubt in his mind that he would win.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“So you didn’t get scared and run away, street rat.”</p>
<p>Chuckling as he spoke, David pointed the tip of his sword at Cassion.</p>
<p>Originally, a rude remark such as this didn’t suit a formal spar at all, but David didn’t hold back since the stands and the arena’s platform were quite far away from each other.</p>
<p>But instead of answering, Cassion just stared back at him and raised an eyebrow.</p>
<p>This, too, grated at David’s nerves.</p>
<p>“You’re looking down at me again?”</p>
<p>“Is it required to talk during a match?”</p>
<p>One man’s nervous voice was answered by another man’s calm, cold voice.</p>
<p>It even felt as if he was just being forced to answer.</p>
<p>Seeing that the other side was not hiding how troublesome he felt this all was, David let out a smile with gritted teeth, then he nodded.</p>
<p>It felt as if his head was boiling red.</p>
<p>“Fine, I’ll just make it so that you won’t ever be able to speak again.”</p>
<p>Saying this with his molars gnashed together, David jumped straight towards his opponent.</p>
<p>Qiiing!</p>
<p>The two swords met in the air, the metal blades screeching out.</p>
<p>Even when David came running with momentum as he slashed his sword forward with more force, Cassion didn’t buckle.</p>
<p>They pushed the other out with similar strength, then backed off with the same timing.</p>
<p>The rest of the match continued in a similar manner.</p>
<p>While sharp eyes looked for gaps in the other’s defenses, and each time they moved forward, a deafening sound would rip the air apart.</p>
<p>On that hot summer day, the sun’s rays descended.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat formed on the foreheads of the two active men.</p>
<p>Qiiing— Chang!</p>
<p>The clashing swords shrieked out as they pushed each other away.</p>
<p>At a brief standstill, the two took a few steps away, catching their breaths as they looked at each other.</p>
<p>It was an implicit time to rest, a form of gauging the opponent.</p>
<p>‘Shit…’</p>
<p>David looked at Cassion and inwardly cursed.</p>
<p>Because the match was going on longer than he expected.</p>
<p>His physical strength was on a gradual decline, his back was soaked with sweat, his breathing was rough and his body was aching all over.</p>
<p>Although he hadn’t been hurt anywhere, just the act of countering the other’s sword consumed a lot of energy.</p>
<p>With a clenched jaw, David glanced at his shaking elbow.</p>
<p>‘…That son of a… Is he really just a street rat?’</p>
<p>He felt it when his wrist was grabbed by him earlier, but this street rat was quite strong.</p>
<p>Whenever their swords clashed, it was usually David, not the street rat, who was being pushed out.</p>
<p>It was so weird.</p>
<p>Obviously, he didn’t think the same when that street rat first came into the Valentine Duchy’s residence and trained with the rest of the knights.</p>
<p>Besides that, his stance.</p>
<p>Back then, people ridiculed him for his sloppy posture and poor sword techniques.</p>
<p>People would say that it couldn’t be helped since he’s just from the streets.</p>
<p>However, the stance of the person David was facing now had absolutely no gaps.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a very formal stance, but there really were no weak spots.</p>
<p>Whenever he wielded his sword, it felt as if he had mastered perfectly the places where to strike and how much force exactly to apply.</p>
<p>In addition, even though he was sweating so much that it looked like he was rained on, there was no change to the light in his eyes which had been there from the start of the match until now.</p>
<p>That glint was reminiscent of a predator’s eyes as it was hunting for food.</p>
<p>In an instant, if felt like killing intent poured out from him.</p>
<p>David clenched his teeth harder as he firmly tried to keep standing on his trembling legs.</p>
<p>‘You made this much progress in that short period of time? Are you serious?’</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe it. No, he didn’t want to believe it. He experienced it firsthand twice already, but it was the kind of reality that he couldn’t believe.</p>
<p>The longer this match went on, the more he’d get pushed back.</p>
<p>By chance…</p>
<p>‘Those rumors… There’s no way they’re true.’</p>
<p>With a hardened expression, David gulped dryly. As he did, he felt his throat burn as hot as fire.</p>
<p>Wait, hold on.</p>
<p>His tightly shut lips curled up.</p>
<p>His brown eyes suddenly showed an unexpected sense of confidence.</p>
<p>David quickly showed that characteristic expression of his, filled with an underhanded, barbarous, unfounded confidence.</p>
<p>Even when he realized just how much stronger of an opponent Cassion was against his expectations. Even though he was losing.</p>
<p>Despite it all, he still believed that victory was his.</p>
<p>This wasn’t just hot air, a false hope or some speculation.</p>
<p>It was a natural, predetermined result.</p>
<p>Because…</p>
<p>‘He’s already been fed the medicine.’</p>
<p>David had already done the proper countermeasures in case the ‘unexpected’ would happen.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 70</p>
<p>A few hours before the match—</p>
<p>After the war of nerves with Cassion, David headed straight towards the fourth knight order’s quarters, not the training grounds.</p>
<p>Taking long strides, he soon reached the door of a certain person’s room.</p>
<p>Bang, bang, bang.</p>
<p>His hand had absolutely no hesitation.</p>
<p>On the wall next to the door, the sign that said 〈 Zobel 〉 shook.</p>
<p>Soon, the door creaked open and a skinny young man appeared.</p>
<p>“D…David.”</p>
<p>David’s brows crumpled as the man stammered and called his name.</p>
<p>“Move.”</p>
<p>Along with the command, David slammed the door fully open. He bulldozed into the room, leaving the thin young man stumbling back.</p>
<p>As he sauntered in, David sat on the small sofa with practiced ease.</p>
<p>Zobel, the owner of this room, closed the door and stood still.</p>
<p>An uncomfortable silence settled over the space, and carrot-colored eyes furtively glanced sideways to gauge David’s mood.</p>
<p>The thin young man looked around like a rabbit for a long time, then he quietly spoke.</p>
<p>“You must be busy preparing for the match…”</p>
<p>“The drug?”</p>
<p>However, the pitiful attempt at conversation was for naught.</p>
<p>Just as if he had chopped a carrot in half, David cut off Zobel mid-sentence.</p>
<p>‘If you were just gonna cut me off, then at least talk first…’</p>
<p>Zobel muttered inwardly, but outwardly, there was a smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“You must be busy, you didn’t need to come here in person. I was going to deliver it to you.”</p>
<p>“If I had left it to a slowpoke like you and waited, the match would have already ended.”</p>
<p>Straightaway, the sharp words held not a single ounce of consideration.</p>
<p>“S…Sorry.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Zobel kept his mouth shut and just faltered like a fool.</p>
<p>He knew very well how painful it was to get hit by David’s huge fist.</p>
<p>David soon approached the desk and leaned down.</p>
<p>Zobel was the son of a doctor who was also a pharmacist, and he went together to the academy with David.</p>
<p>He knew a lot about medicines like his father, and he learned how to make prescriptions from herbs and also minored in medicine in the academy.</p>
<p>Originally, there were always some people among the knights who would dabble in case a war breaks out, and Zobel was one of them.</p>
<p>However, what’s unfortunate was that his skills as a pharmacist were much better than his skills as a knight.</p>
<p>However, his dream was to become a knight who’s skilled in the medical arts, so he needed to enter the knighthood.</p>
<p>David was someone who noticed Zobel’s talent.</p>
<p>Since his way of thinking was crooked in the first place, David planned from the very start to use Zobel to ensure victory in his matches.</p>
<p>As a fellow academy student, he was well aware of his skills.</p>
<p>And so too was David aware of Zobel’s timid nature.</p>
<p>After bringing Zobel into submission by using brute force, he became David’s pawn in an instant.</p>
<p>Zobel tried to refuse at first.</p>
<p>He said that he couldn’t do such a thing—he couldn’t throw away his conscience.</p>
<p>Until the pot lid-like hands beat him until he gave the answer David wanted.</p>
<p>When the bruises on his body couldn’t possibly increase any longer, when his thighs turned black and blue from all the beatings, that was the point when Zobel started to constantly stutter in front of David.</p>
<p>In the end, Zobel was the one who surrendered.</p>
<p>And his surrender continued to this day.</p>
<p>For more than two years now, he secretly served David as a personal pharmacist and pawn. He always had a hand in David’s matches.</p>
<p>Two years had already passed like that, but every time he did this, his conscience continued to be prickled.</p>
<p>However, he had no choice but to help in this way, and so he turned a blind eye to his conscience as he had nightmares of David beating him up every night.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Zobel grew emaciated, and his eyes always had dark circles around them.</p>
<p>The other people in the knight order also slowly started to avoid Zobel.</p>
<p>David was pleased with this fact.</p>
<p>The more isolated and distant he was from other people, the better. This ensured that Zobel’s aid would remain a secret.</p>
<p>The loneliness and torment that Zobel felt were nowhere near the trouble David brought him.</p>
<p>“Um… D…David, thanks to the herb that you supplied… it wa…wasn’t hard to make the medicine. T…Thank you.”</p>
<p>As Zobel murmured his thanks, he rummaged through the bottles of medicine on the desk for a long time.</p>
<p>David was sitting back on the sofa while letting out angry huffs, but he soon smirked at this.</p>
<p>How hilarious was it that someone who’s trembling like a scared rabbit was saying such sugar-coated words.</p>
<p>Ever since he saw the detestable face of that ‘street rat’, he felt a little better.</p>
<p>David nodded as he answered.</p>
<p>“Yeah, I had to take action because of your useless incompetence.”</p>
<p>It was a few weeks ago that David ordered Zobel to make ‘a perfect drug that no one would notice’.</p>
<p>It was the same day that David had been appointed as Cassion’s opponent.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a long time, Zobel finally found a good formulation for the drug.</p>
<p>However, there was a problem.</p>
<p>There was one particular ingredient needed for it, but it was something that not just anyone could acquire.</p>
<p>With a great deal of hesitation in case he might strike a nerve, Zobel carefully asked David.</p>
<p>‘I’ve heard rumors about a g…guild, and I think they can supply this ingredient. B…But, it’s just, the guild doesn’t accept requests from s…someone like me. Is it alright if y…you help with this? Since y…you’re a member of House Valentine’s b…branch family.’</p>
<p>It was a very troublesome request. But then again, did he have a choice?</p>
<p>The perfect formulation of course needed such an ingredient, and that ingredient was being supplied by that guild.</p>
<p>This punk was so useless that he couldn’t even get his hands on it himself.</p>
<p>David soon signed and stamped the request form from Zobel.</p>
<p>‘Done? You take care of it from here. Don’t bother me with that anymore.’</p>
<p>And of course, he didn’t forget to speak harshly.</p>
<p>Zobel, as he usually did, only nodded with that foolish smile on his lips.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>Recalling what happened a few weeks ago, David raised his leg and brought it down to the table.</p>
<p>The heavy sound made Zobel’s shoulders flinch.</p>
<p>The sight of the young man was hilarious once again, and David laughed. Hahaha.</p>
<p>The emaciated man couldn’t utter a word of complaint at this. The only sound after that was bottles of medicine that he made clinking against each other.</p>
<p>Hahaha.</p>
<p>The unpleasant guest’s guffaws filled the room.</p>
<p>Zobel, all of a sudden, felt suffocated by that laughter.</p>
<p>Neither able to smile nor cry, Zobel’s face distorted strangely as he turned his back on David.</p>
<p>After about ten minutes.</p>
<p>Zobel finally presented the finished product to David.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, it was still Zobel’s job to poison the opponent’s food, so David nodded after only roughly checking the bottle.</p>
<p>Well, even this action was just for show.</p>
<p>In fact, even if David knew anything about formulating, how much exactly would he know?</p>
<p>All he did was nod a couple times and act as if he knew what he was looking at.</p>
<p>Zobel’s formulations had been working properly for two years now, so there’s nothing for him to worry about.</p>
<p>The two left the room one after another a few moments apart.</p>
<p>Zobel walked with the bottle in his pocket, and David followed from a distance.</p>
<p>Soon, Zobel arrived at the training grounds where Maxwell was practicing a sword dance.</p>
<p>David hid himself behind a column and watched the two.</p>
<p>Zobel naturally knocked over Maxwell’s water bottle.</p>
<p>He bowed his head in apology, and in response, Maxwell waved his hand as though it’s alright.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the thin man’s back continued to bow down, then very consciously handed over a bottle from his own pocket to the other man.</p>
<p>Without any questions asked, Maxwell accepted it.</p>
<p>And to reassure Zobel, he drank the bottle’s contents in front of him.</p>
<p>‘…I got you now.’</p>
<p>As he hid and watched everything, David smirked insidiously.</p>
<p>As the adam’s apple of that man bobbed up and down while he drank the water, it felt as if the anxiety lodged in David’s heart was being washed away.</p>
<p>With a refreshed mood, David turned his back on the two.</p>
<p>The steps he took as he walked away were light. As if he was about to soar through the air.</p>
<p>‘Yeah, victory is mine.’</p>
<p>The position as the ducal princess’ escort knight, honor, prestige, and even a place next to the young lady as her spouse. All of these were his.</p>
<p>The rewards that would follow his victory were listed one after another in his mind.</p>
<p>“Hehehe…”</p>
<p>Unable to push down the urge, a smile curled up on his lips.</p>
<p>It was the face of a man entirely consumed by greed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And, back to the present.</p>
<p>As David recalled that bobbing adam’s apple, he smiled once more.</p>
<p>It was a smile that would make anyone question whether or not he’d lost his senses because of the scorching heat.</p>
<p>“…Did he go crazy?”</p>
<p>Cassion murmured to himself.</p>
<p>It was a sincere question that even came from his core.</p>
<p>Then again, whether it’s true or not.</p>
<p>David still continued to let out a snicker as he wiped the sweat from his forehead.</p>
<p>“The match has been decided anyway. That’s why, don’t be ashamed, why don’t you just surrender now?”</p>
<p>He brushed off his sweat-stained sleeves as he said this. His voice was full of derision and arrogance.</p>
<p>Cassion frowned.</p>
<p>‘Apparently, his specialty is relying on underhanded tricks, but…’</p>
<p>His black eyes glanced sideways.</p>
<p>Towards the balcony surrounded with ivory marble.</p>
<p>Over there, sitting with impeccable posture, was the silver-haired woman.</p>
<p>She was sitting beneath the shade, yet despite being covered by that dark shadow, his gaze momentarily met those golden eyes at once.</p>
<p>Even though there was quite a distance between them, he could see that the corners of that woman’s red lips were tugged up into a smile.</p>
<p>Her hair fluttered as she fanned herself, and those red lips moved to utter a few words.</p>
<p>Amazingly enough, her words were clear.</p>
<p>‘Don’t worry. You’ll win.’</p>
<p>Receiving this silent reinforcement, Cassion ran forward with no hesitation.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of underhanded trick his opponent would throw at him, he wasn’t worried.</p>
<p>Rosetta.</p>
<p>Rosetta said that he shouldn’t worry, that he would win.</p>
<p>Has she ever said something that didn’t come true?</p>
<p>No. Not at all.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 71</p>
<p>The floor gradually became more drenched.</p>
<p>It was because of the drops of sweat that trickled down like rain, unable to stay on the men’s bodies.</p>
<p>The more drenched the floor became, the more flustered David grew.</p>
<p>‘Why… Why…’</p>
<p>Why the hell. Was the drug ineffective?</p>
<p>With most of the people who’d taken Zobel’s formulation, it was by the middle of the match that their eyes would become unfocused already.</p>
<p>At first, the effects used to come out before the start of the match, making them have stomachaches or headaches. As a result, there was a time when there was one guy who doubted his physical condition.</p>
<p>He said, ‘Why did I get a stomachache when I didn’t eat anything?’ and so on.</p>
<p>Only a slight suspicion was raised, but for the guilty party who actually committed the crime, erasing even the slightest doubt was the best way to preserve one’s life.</p>
<p>Therefore, David asked Zobel to make a different kind of formulation.</p>
<p>One that would take effect in the middle of the match instead.</p>
<p>Since then, everyone would just think that they got tired from the spar, or perhaps they were just in a bad condition—but never once did they think that they had been drugged.</p>
<p>All in all, it was a perfect crime.</p>
<p>Yeah, it should be…</p>
<p>‘It’s around the time that the drug should take effect.’</p>
<p>But then, why the hell was this guy still standing upright?</p>
<p>This was David’s thought as he countered his own sword against the other man’s sword that was about to lunge for his throat.</p>
<p>Chang!</p>
<p>A shrill sound broke out, one that was now a familiar noise.</p>
<p>His feet staggered on the ground, scared that his neck would truly be crushed by his opponent’s force.</p>
<p>Even so, he couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>Somehow, the drug wasn’t working, but he couldn’t possibly lose against a street rat.</p>
<p>He twisted his sword against the sword pressing down on him. He struck forward, aiming for his opponent’s neck.</p>
<p>Cassion’s eyes widened, then he hunched down. Then, he jumped straight at David.</p>
<p>Qiiiing.</p>
<p>Accompanied with the screeching of metal, the blades of both swords met as the two opponents closed the distance between them.</p>
<p>Both men had the same hunch at the same time.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that the match would be decided.</p>
<p>Time passed by slowly for the two opponents amidst the stifling tension.</p>
<p>Exactly like the moment before one’s death, when life would flash behind one’s eyes.</p>
<p>Their grips on their swords were close together, the back of their hands almost touching.</p>
<p>Their eyes, sweaty hair, clenched lips.</p>
<p>The other’s shaking jaw could be seen so clearly.</p>
<p>Even one’s breaths seemed to shift between these figures.</p>
<p>David, standing on top after slashing his sword down. And Cassion, who had his sword raised from below.</p>
<p>The two men’s battling gazes met at the center.</p>
<p>Neither opened their mouths to speak, but a growl that could only be theirs rang out in each other’s ears.</p>
<p>Then, an untimely gust of wind blew past.</p>
<p>A truly unusual wind during this scorching summer day.</p>
<p>There was a buzz at the audience stands where the crowd was.</p>
<p>The women’s hair fluttered in the air, and the men closed their eyes tightly.</p>
<p>David was no different.</p>
<p>Who wouldn’t panic against an act of nature that went against the season?</p>
<p>Dust flew into his eyes, his eyelashes unable to catch them, and so he couldn’t help but blink.</p>
<p>He tried to endure it somehow, but it was impossible.</p>
<p>Then, in the blink of an eye, the match was decided.</p>
<p>A moment’s instance.</p>
<p>The one time his vision was blocked, Cassion turned.</p>
<p>Pressing beneath the wrist of David’s sword hand, Cassion spun around, and at the same time, Cassion’s back was to David’s chest.</p>
<p>Cassion placed his sword hand under David’s wrist and held David’s arm with his other hand.</p>
<p>In one fluid motion, the man sprung forward with an arc, throwing David’s body from behind and to the front, on the ground.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>David’s huge back fell to the floor with the noise that was as big as his size.</p>
<p>Absolutely befuddled, David couldn’t understand what happened in just a flash.</p>
<p>He just blinked for a split second, but then when he opened his eyes again, what he saw was the blue summer sky instead of the black eyes of his opponent.</p>
<p>The man looked up at the sky, bewildered, but he soon clenched his teeth and tried to get back on his feet.</p>
<p>However, he had to stop in place because of the blade that was pointed at him.</p>
<p>The shadow of the man who was standing upright loomed and covered the blue sky.</p>
<p>From the ground and from the sky, the two faced each other, their eyes locked as they breathed roughly, sweating.</p>
<p>The arena was imbued with silence.</p>
<p>In that breathless moment, one person’s applause broke out.</p>
<p>And that was the trigger.</p>
<p>Like fireworks, cheers and applause soon burst through.</p>
<p>Evidently, these cheers were not for the man lying prone on the ground, but for the man standing upright.</p>
<p>Soon, the color-bearer appeared and waved the flag in his hands.</p>
<p>A knight, who looked to be a high-ranking person, was standing next to the color-bearer.</p>
<p>Then, he proclaimed.</p>
<p>“David Valheim, Maxwell. The winner is Maxwell!”</p>
<p>It was the definite signal of the spar’s end.</p>
<p>The match was over.</p>
<p>The winner had been decided.</p>
<p>Victory was claimed by the person nobody expected to win.</p>
<p>When Cassion pulled his sword away, the hot summer air moved as well.</p>
<p>Shwaa.</p>
<p>Against that hot air, the sword was returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>Cassion stretched out one hand to his opponent, who was still on the ground.</p>
<p>Drip, drip.</p>
<p>Beads of sweat fell from the sky and onto David’s face.</p>
<p>The trickles that fell under his eyes made it look like he had shed tears.</p>
<p>As he stared at Cassion’s outstretched hand, David gnashed his molars.</p>
<p>He was bewildered, enraged, infuriated.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand why he was being given the sportsman-like behavior of a winner towards a loser.</p>
<p>Instead of taking the other man’s hand, David got back on his feet by himself, roughly wiping off the sweat on his face.</p>
<p>Cassion withdrew his hand.</p>
<p>Staggering up, David planted his legs on the ground.</p>
<p>The sword in his hand was returned to its scabbard.</p>
<p>His vision spun and his back was in pain.</p>
<p>He had a terrible headache.</p>
<p>However, what he felt now was even worse than all things combined.</p>
<p>After facing each other, the two bowed.</p>
<p>Unlike the indifferent expression Cassion had, David’s countenance was red and distorted as he was unable to hide his emotions.</p>
<p>After the brief bow, Cassion was the first to turn away.</p>
<p>David foolishly stood in place while staring at his back.</p>
<p>‘This can’t be. Did it really end?’</p>
<p>A loss? Seriously? To that street rat?</p>
<p>He was brought back from his reverie by a bark of laughter.</p>
<p>It wasn’t someone else’s. It was his own.</p>
<p>As he laughed for a long time, the ridiculing words recited by his own voice echoed in his mind.</p>
<p>‘Anyway, I don’t know who’s going to be that bastard’s opponent, but…’</p>
<p>Whoever it is, then you’re even lower than the ground beneath my hand.</p>
<p>“AAAAARGH!”</p>
<p>For a moment, red hot rage rose to his throat. And this fury burst through his mouth.</p>
<p>His hand reached for the scabbard where he had just pushed in his sword.</p>
<p>This red anger and shame flooded his brown eyes.</p>
<p>All he could see was the back of the man who humiliated him.</p>
<p>He was about to lunge at any given moment, but in less than a few steps, he faltered.</p>
<p>“…Ugh… uuurk…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, a severe stomachache held his entire body hostage.</p>
<p>His trembling legs sharply buckled, making him crash to the ground.</p>
<p>He had no idea what was going on.</p>
<p>The face that was red with anger just a moment ago soon turned pale.</p>
<p>A few knights came running to David’s side.</p>
<p>It was a clear offense to try and point a sword at the opponent when the match had already ended.</p>
<p>Cassion, the person who was about to be attacked, also stopped and watched David’s collapse.</p>
<p>The gaze looking down was icy.</p>
<p>With David on the ground while clutching his stomach, the knights grabbed the man’s arms and forced him back on his feet.</p>
<p>“David Valheim, as a knight, you have committed the offense of targeting a defenseless opponent after the match has ended. Additionally.”</p>
<p>The knight who declared David’s offense paused for a moment before explaining further.</p>
<p>‘Additionally?’</p>
<p>Even when his guts were all twisted up, David hung onto the word, ‘additionally’.</p>
<p>Was he saying that there’s more?</p>
<p>However, no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t think of any other offense that could follow.</p>
<p>No way…</p>
<p>There’s no way at all that he was caught.</p>
<p>However, there was no chance of a perfect denial in this world.</p>
<p>“Earlier this day, there was a report about you, David Valheim, and how you’ve been continuously committing the act of poisoning your opponents’ food every time an assessment of the knights is held. After a thorough investigation, a harsh punishment shall be delivered!”</p>
<p>As the knight’s words resounded, the surroundings grew restless.</p>
<p>It all started small, with only whispers, but then before he knew it, these soon became huge like a typhoon.</p>
<p>Shocked gazes rushed towards David.</p>
<p>And these gazes were as sharp as knives.</p>
<p>“That’s impossible, sir! I’ve been framed!”</p>
<p>Pale and blue in the face, David stomped one foot down and shouted.</p>
<p>“How can you charge such things to a person when there’s no evidence?! I don’t know anything about this!”</p>
<p>It was enough that his past deeds had been revealed, but he couldn’t just get dragged away like this.</p>
<p>Because there was no evidence, as long as he insisted that this was unfair treatment, there’s no way they’re going to punish him.</p>
<p>However, David’s clamoring did not change the expressions of the knights holding him by the arms.</p>
<p>No, actually, there was.</p>
<p>The seriousness painting their expression turned into scorn towards him,</p>
<p>They looked at him as though he was pathetic, and David stopped struggling for a moment.</p>
<p>It dawned on him that something was definitely wrong here.</p>
<p>As one knight met his gaze, he let out a short sigh and spoke.</p>
<p>“The corresponding evidence has already been secured. There is a written statement detailing your offenses, and documents related to this were found when members of a certain guild had been arrested. David Valheim, have you not commissioned a banned substance in your name?”</p>
<p>Guild. Substance. Commission.</p>
<p>These familiar words stuck out to him.</p>
<p>As the words were gathered together, he recalled a memory.</p>
<p>The document that Zobel had presented to him weeks ago.</p>
<p>That very commissioned request that was placed in David’s name because Zobel couldn’t get it on his own.</p>
<p>‘What was it again that’s written there?’</p>
<p>As he tried to recall, his brown pupils shook, but he still couldn’t remember.</p>
<p>It was a document that was presented by a guy who’s been acting like a submissive pawn for the past two years, so all he could recall was signing that document without even reading it.</p>
<p>David hurriedly looked around towards the crowd.</p>
<p>Zobel.</p>
<p>He had to find Zobel.</p>
<p>He had to find that punk so that he could figure out just what the hell was going on.</p>
<p>As he looked around frantically with a stiff expression, the knights between both sides of David began to move forward.</p>
<p>He struggled noisily, but it was to no avail.</p>
<p>His tired body was dragged away helplessly.</p>
<p>Somehow or another, David tried to force out his strength and hold out.</p>
<p>Even as he was being dragged away, the first thing he needed to do was find Zobel.</p>
<p>And, at long last.</p>
<p>His desperate gaze finally found the face he’d been searching for.</p>
<p>Zobel.</p>
<p>He was smiling.</p>
<p>Despite those gaunt cheeks and deep-set eyes, he was smiling so broadly.</p>
<p>It was a bright, refreshed smile. Not a forced smile.</p>
<p>On the other hand, David was left taken aback.</p>
<p>Was this what it felt to be hit in the back of the head with a huge iron club?</p>
<p>Was this what it felt to be bitten by the loyal dog that you’ve been raising?</p>
<p>Zobel smiled silently, then hid himself amidst the crowd.</p>
<p>As he was in a dazed trance, David finally snapped out of it and began struggling again.</p>
<p>“Th…That son of a—! You’re not staying put?! HEY! Stop right there! Stop!”</p>
<p>His tired throat was scratched with all the shouting.</p>
<p>The knights just stared at David, whose face grew distorted as he went wild like a horse that’s gone mad.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter if he did this or that.</p>
<p>David struggled to keep his rear end back while planting his feet to the ground with all his might.</p>
<p>He couldn’t let himself be dragged away like this.</p>
<p>Even if he had no choice but to go, he just had to at least knock out that damn punk.</p>
<p>He’s gonna grab that punk by the collar, push him down on the floor and beat him black and blue.</p>
<p>David would beat him up so thoroughly that he wouldn’t be able to smile ever again.</p>
<p>His furious eyes rolled around busily, but it was almost impossible to find someone who had already blended into the crowd.</p>
<p>It would be easier to find a needle in a haystack.</p>
<p>When the man he was looking for was nowhere to be found, his stomach began to cramp up again. The pain had subsided only temporarily in his shock.</p>
<p>It felt as if he had been punched right in the gut, and so he hunched over in pain.</p>
<p>“Wait… just a… minute… my… my stomach…”</p>
<p>The sudden influx was double the pain compared to earlier.</p>
<p>His insides felt as if everything’s melting in there, as if it’s not enough to just be all twisted up.</p>
<p>The knights who were dragging David away dismissed his pain as a ruse, but then they realized that something was wrong when the man’s face turned as white as a sheet. They stopped walking.</p>
<p>“Hey, what’s up with you.”</p>
<p>“David? David Valheim?”</p>
<p>The knights stood still and called out to him.</p>
<p>On his pale face, his brown eyes shook, entirely unfocused.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 72</p>
<p>That was how the match ended.</p>
<p>The match, which was between a former mercenary on the streets, who was brought in by the duke’s esteemed daughter, and the top-ranked knight, who turned out to have been maintaining that position through underhanded means.</p>
<p>The winner was the former.</p>
<p>However, this was not the only reason why this unprecedented match brought about a lot of controversy.</p>
<p>Shortly after the match, as ‘David Valheim’ was being dragged away by the other knights, he suddenly complained of a sudden stomachache and then he… well… sullied his pants.</p>
<p>It was a visual, olfactory experience.</p>
<p>In the midst of the spectacle that stimulated many senses, people were left to choose whether to yell out or remain silent.</p>
<p>When their surroundings were brought to a silent standstill, someone just let out a huge sigh of frustration.</p>
<p>Then, after everything settled down, the ducal residence was noisy all day.</p>
<p>The crowd who watched the match went back to their respective stations and talked about what happened.</p>
<p>About twenty percent of their conversations was about ‘the street mercenary’s victory’, while the remaining eighty percent was about ‘the loser’s bowels’.</p>
<p>That’s why in this regard, after today’s events, the real winner was the latter.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody would ever want such a victory.</p>
<p>That’s how the day went by, in any case.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That night—</p>
<p>The round moon rose towards the place where the bright summer sun once was, and the deep indigo darkness hung over the sky.</p>
<p>After checking to see that the guest room that Cassion was staying in temporarily was empty, I left the mansion.</p>
<p>And then, I headed towards the vacant clearing.</p>
<p>Cassion and I, Diana and Logan.</p>
<p>It was the secret place that only the four of us knew about.</p>
<p>And of course, as the owner of that vacant clearing, I was present.</p>
<p>I approached while purposely letting my presence known.</p>
<p>So that the man who was sitting on the dry summer grass would notice.</p>
<p>He was staring blankly at the sky, but he slowly turned his head.</p>
<p>And the man’s darkened face gradually became more open.</p>
<p>“Rosetta?”</p>
<p>“It was a shame.”</p>
<p>I answered his call with a smile.</p>
<p>“You’re not sleeping yet? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Nothing much. I was going to congratulate today’s victor, but his room was empty.”</p>
<p>“I received your congratulations earlier though?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you did. But that was for my newly appointed escort knight, Maxwell.”</p>
<p>After the match, I faced Cassion briefly. It was to appoint him as my escort knight in front of the crowd.</p>
<p>However, that greeting and those congratulatory remarks were only for formality’s sake.</p>
<p>Diana’s cover was to be my maid, so she’s around me a lot, and I also met Logan recently and talked for a while.</p>
<p>After that, there was a family dinner, so there was no time for the two of us to meet up.</p>
<p>Then I went to see him late at night, but the room was empty.</p>
<p>“But I’m here to congratulate someone else, right now.”</p>
<p>There was a playful smile on my lips as I said this, and Cassion, who was facing me, smiled as well.</p>
<p>He leaned his cheek against one upright knee.</p>
<p>Because of this, the gaze facing me was also slanted. So, I sat down with one knee up just like him, leaning down on it as well. In the end, our eyes were not the right side up, but they matched.</p>
<p>“Are you here to congratulate me? Not Maxwell?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m here to congratulate you. Not Maxwell.”</p>
<p>“What did you mean when you said, ‘It was a shame’?” he asked.</p>
<p>I had to look away for a moment because I tried to recall what he meant, but then I remembered that I answered him earlier with that line when he called my name.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Without realizing it, I burst into laughter. On the contrary though, his eyebrows twitched slightly.</p>
<p>This was all the natural reaction, and so my own feelings on both sides were valid.</p>
<p>That it was hilarious, but at the same time, not really funny.</p>
<p>“Today’s main character is supposed to be you, but then Mister Potty Pants just had to steal the show. Thanks to that, you’ve become the knight who claimed victory against that poo man.”</p>
<p>What a disgraceful nickname it was.</p>
<p>Well, anyone could sully their pants, really.</p>
<p>Yeah, it could happen to anyone.</p>
<p>But what’s with that timing?</p>
<p>Cassion won the match with such style, but it was such an unexpected thing for the opponent to end up shitting himself right there.</p>
<p>I was so speechless that I couldn’t even laugh.</p>
<p>…No, scratch that.</p>
<p>Actually, I did sort of laugh.</p>
<p>Anyway, the ducal residence was noisy bustling with stories not of Maxwell’s victory as he claimed dominance over the opposing knight, but with stories of how David was dragged away with shit in his pants.</p>
<p>What’s fortunate here was that the match between the two was quite intense, so the winner’s skills were not disparaged at all.</p>
<p>I tried to pick out a better complaint amongst the ones that I had now, but while I did so, Cassion blinked as though he didn’t expect this.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t that your doing?”</p>
<p>“My doing? No?”</p>
<p>“…Logan and Diana clearly believe it was you though.”</p>
<p>“…Did you think so, too?”</p>
<p>The man’s lips pressed together in a straight line. His questioning gaze furtively tried to look away, but turned back.</p>
<p>“Aha. You thought so, too, right?”</p>
<p>I was taken aback as well.</p>
<p>By all means, why would I have done such a thing?</p>
<p>Of course, to be quite honest, if my goal was to make the opponent shit himself, I’m very confident that I could make that possible.</p>
<p>But what would I gain from turning him into mister potty pants in this match?</p>
<p>I wouldn’t bother to meddle with such a worthless man.</p>
<p>It’d just be a waste of my time.</p>
<p>“How upsetting. I said I’d trust you, so I did. I even gave up on my sure-fire plans to make David lose… But you didn’t trust me, did you?”</p>
<p>As I bobbed my toes, I trailed off and stretched my words. At this, the corners of Cassion’s lips tugged up.</p>
<p>Now this was unexpected.</p>
<p>I thought you’d look at me with an apologetic face.</p>
<p>His eyes curved beautifully along with the smile on his lips, and he bobbed his toes just as I had. Then, he spoke.</p>
<p>“No. I trust you. That’s why I thought you had a hand in it. After all, I know that you’ll ensure a perfect victory no matter what.”</p>
<p>“…That’s a pretty good answer.”</p>
<p>“Right? Me, too. I also like your answer.”</p>
<p>Thank you for trusting me.</p>
<p>He added in a hushed whisper.</p>
<p>Silently, pleasantly even as we didn’t smile, we looked at one another.</p>
<p>“It feels like it’s only yesterday when you were so freaked out about us touching lips.”</p>
<p>As I continued to face the man’s black eyes, I blurted out the words as though I was reciting them.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He pretended as if he didn’t hear anything and instead answered with a question calmly, however his pupils shook ever so slightly.</p>
<p>At this, I let out a laugh. He glanced over my way lightly.</p>
<p>I was the one who sat back first. I kept my head leaning in a slant all that time, so my neck was stiff.</p>
<p>With my arms behind me, propped on the ground, I looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>Countless stars abundantly filled the heavens as if they had been poured over, and the night sky was as clear as the daytime sky.</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m not the one who did that to him. Of course, I did plan for him to get dragged away like that.”</p>
<p>However, this part of the plan was something that Diana, Logan and Cassion already knew.</p>
<p>With me still sitting in that position, Cassion stared at me.</p>
<p>“Then who was the one who gave him the medicine? Obviously, the symptoms came out too suddenly for someone who’s supposed to be sick beforehand.”</p>
<p>“It was Zobel.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“David’s academy schoolmate, son of a pharmacist, and member of the Fourth Knight Order. And… the one who helped us get David to sign that illegal commissioned request.”</p>
<p>“Him?”</p>
<p>Surprised, Cassion asked back.</p>
<p>He seemed to be quite shocked that his previously leaned over head straightened back up from that slant.</p>
<p>Certainly, he’s the only one.</p>
<p>Zobel was, obviously enough, a thin, weak man.</p>
<p>From beginning to end, he’s just been walking on eggshells around a certain person.</p>
<p>Yet there’s no one else but him who’d do it.</p>
<p>While investigating David closely, we found out that Zobel was lending a helping hand in these schemes, so we went to meet up with him.</p>
<p>To use him in order to secure evidence against David.</p>
<p>But then, when I met him and said, ‘I came to you because I know you’ve been helping David,’</p>
<p>He blacked out.</p>
<p>Literally. He fainted right then and there.</p>
<p>His eyes rolled up so only the whites of his eyes could be seen, and then it was thirty minutes later that he came to again.</p>
<p>After he regained his senses, I told Zobel about the plan to arrest David, and when I blackmailed him into joining the plan, he was shaking in his boots. Even so, he thought hard about it before answering.</p>
<p>Then, he nodded and replied that he would cooperate with us.</p>
<p>Throughout the process, Zobel seemed very much like the frightened, vulnerable man that he looked like, so it was no wonder that Cassion was surprised by this.</p>
<p>“I went to see Diana a bit after dinner. And that knight. While crying about how he had been drugged, he confessed.”</p>
<p>“Diana? Ah, sure enough… I met Diana before dinnertime, so that’s why.”</p>
<p>Cassion murmured under his breath with a blank expression.</p>
<p>Like Cassion, Diana had also suspected me of being the culprit, but he soon realized that she already knew the truth.</p>
<p>Shrugging, I continued my explanation.</p>
<p>“It seems like David’s been bullying him a lot. He’s only helping David because of the threats he’s been receiving, so he had no choice but to do all that, but when he heard that I’m out to get David, he also took this opportunity to exact his revenge.”</p>
<p>“Ha, it truly is an eye for an eye.”</p>
<p>“It really is, yeah.”</p>
<p>While speaking in the way a villain I knew would, it sounded like the most dismal and cruel thing.</p>
<p>The man next to me seemed to have the same train of thought, so I stayed silent for a moment.</p>
<p>Soon, he sat back like me.</p>
<p>As he propped his arms behind him, I could see the tendons on both his arms visibly.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I just had to admire it. His body was already originally firm, but he’s become even more muscular.</p>
<p>Unbeknownst to my thoughts, Cassion quietly spoke as he looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>“So, are you going to tell your father or your brother about it?”</p>
<p>From looking at his forearms, I looked up to see his side profile.</p>
<p>His gaze, as he looked at the sky, held a bit of tension.</p>
<p>My eyes inched down.</p>
<p>His adam’s apple bobbed up and down as he gulped dryly.</p>
<p>Everything I could see from his body language told me that he wanted me to ‘deny’ it.</p>
<p>This huge man, with these rippling muscles all over his body, had his teeth clenched while thinking of the long period of bullying, filled with tension at the torment of waiting for forgiveness for this act of revenge.</p>
<p>Hoping to breathe comfortably once mercy has thus been given.</p>
<p>I raised my gaze upwards.</p>
<p>I looked round over his head, towards the sky.</p>
<p>The evening sky was as beautiful as the heavens during that night.</p>
<p>That night, when Cassion was inside that falling carriage.</p>
<p>That night, when he was trapped in that alley while heavily injured, and when he stopped breathing for a moment.</p>
<p>Perhaps Cassion was also recalling the clear sky of that night.</p>
<p>I opened my lips and spoke carefully.</p>
<p>“A victim of bullying just took revenge and retaliated. How could something like that be condemned?”</p>
<p>It’s just self defense, of course.</p>
<p>I do hope my answer was what this man was wishing to hear.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 73</p>
<p>Cassion laughed and said that it was just like me to answer that way.</p>
<p>In his calm gaze, a delighted glimmer faintly flickered. Much more relaxed now, he murmured.</p>
<p>“Right, but still, there’s something else that’s a shame.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The relaxed expression crumpled slightly. As always, his emotions could be seen just as they were.</p>
<p>He glanced at me again and let out a short sigh, his brows furrowed together as he opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“I wanted to deal with that scoundrel myself, but in the end, he was done in by the drug that he took.”</p>
<p>For a moment, I recalled what Cassion said the other day.</p>
<p>‘I want to gouge out that man’s eyes—I had a thought like this today, for the first time in my life.’</p>
<p>With the palpable killing intent barely suppressed from the look of his black eyes, he spat out these words.</p>
<p>“As I thought, you meant it, huh…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Nothing, just talking to myself. Besides that, it’s not too much of a shame that this happened.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>What indeed.</p>
<p>“Besides the agreed upon medicinal effects, there’s one extra that Zobel added there, and it went over smoothly. I guess he noticed that my own requests weren’t that big of a deal.”</p>
<p>Zobel’s prescription, with these medicinal effects, were as follows:</p>
<p>The drug would take effect within the span of at least half an hour.</p>
<p>But apart from that, the moment that the person’s body, which had been very active thus far, would suddenly stop—that’s when the drug’s effects would come out.</p>
<p>This was something Zobel made possible with his own hands, and it’s clear to see that he was an amazing rising star in the medical world.</p>
<p>After explaining this to Cassion, I briefly added.</p>
<p>“That’s why while you were fighting, his condition wouldn’t have been altered.”</p>
<p>“…Then…”</p>
<p>As he gazed into the air, he murmured to himself. Smiling at his bewildered reaction, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, you won all by yourself. You did great out there. From now on, you won’t need to roll on the ground and hide again.”</p>
<p>I hummed playfully and gave the man a pat on the shoulder.</p>
<p>The light tap made him fall and lie back.</p>
<p>What a shocking reaction.</p>
<p>I only tapped him very lightly.</p>
<p>Cassion, as he threw me into confusion, lay back on the green grass and stared blankly up at the sky.</p>
<p>Moonlight streamed down upon his face.</p>
<p>He looked really pale.</p>
<p>The black eyes of the man looked deeper than the evening sky. Before long, a single tear trickled down from one eye.</p>
<p>And that was it.</p>
<p>The time in which he shed tears was very short.</p>
<p>Like a shooting star, flickering across the night sky.</p>
<p>Wordlessly, I reached into a pocket and took out a handkerchief. But my hand soon stopped.</p>
<p>Because there wasn’t even a trace of that tear left.</p>
<p>Still, I reached out. After pressing the handkerchief over his dry eyes, I spoke.</p>
<p>“It’s barely one hurdle crossed. Only Maxwell’s abilities have been recognized for now, so it’s still too early to cry.”</p>
<p>Cassion nodded in silence. His eyes were covered but my handkerchief, but his lips were enough to express his determination.</p>
<p>His lips were closed like that for a long time, but soon, their corners tugged up into a smile.</p>
<p>Slowly lifting his head from the ground, the handkerchief slid down to his chin.</p>
<p>Catching the handkerchief before it could fall, he spoke.</p>
<p>“Honestly, even just crying is funny.”</p>
<p>“What’s so funny about it?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Cassion sat up straight.</p>
<p>He looked into my eyes as he smiled with a hint of shame. Then, he leaned in closer to my ear.</p>
<p>There was no one but the two of us in this spacious open clearing, but it’s as if the secret could still be overheard.</p>
<p>I turned my head according to his movements.</p>
<p>So that the man’s red lips could get closer to my ear.</p>
<p>He whispered carefully.</p>
<p>“Truthfully, the wind—I’m the culprit.”</p>
<p>As I heard a more shocking confession than what I was expecting, I looked up at him, baffled.</p>
<p>For a moment, our cheeks brushed past each other.</p>
<p>Whether cold or warm, they were so close that I couldn’t even tell whose temperature this was.</p>
<p>Perhaps the corners of our lips touched. Perhaps not.</p>
<p>As I blinked, Cassion turned his head.</p>
<p>All I could see were his bright red nape and earlobes.</p>
<p>He’s the one who whispered into my ear quite shamelessly, but he’s blushing so much with his head turned back like this. I should have teased him.</p>
<p>But strangely enough, instead of doing that, I had to fan myself secretly because my face had gone hot.</p>
<p>As if we had gotten ourselves into an accidental car crash, we both shut up and didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>The first to return to their senses was me.</p>
<p>I shrugged my tense shoulders for a moment, then asked a question with the most casual tone I could muster.</p>
<p>“So the wind that blew past during the match—you’re the one who did it?”</p>
<p>Cassion’s nape was still flushed. It looked as if he either rubbed it too much or someone hit him there.</p>
<p>Perhaps aware of this, he only nodded while still looking away.</p>
<p>“You said if I’m in a pinch, I should use it without being discovered.”</p>
<p>In contrast, however, his voice was quite calm.</p>
<p>It’s just that his bright red cheeks couldn’t lose the color.</p>
<p>Really, the more I get to know him, he’s such a pure man.</p>
<p>Soon enough, his wide back turned around so he could face me.</p>
<p>A large hand rummaged through his coat pocket, pulled out a small folded note, then pushed this note towards me.</p>
<p>He didn’t explain what the folded piece of paper was, but nevertheless, I could guess what this was just by one look at it.</p>
<p>Because I’m the one who gave this to him in the first place.</p>
<p>〈 Practical Magic Spells to Use During an Actual Fight That No One Would Notice 〉</p>
<p>I opened the folded paper with a smile. Indeed, it was just as Cassion said. There written was a secret method to that heavy breeze.</p>
<p>When he first read these instructions, he must not have been able to make heads or tails of what’s written there. But one small illustration on the piece of paper was now funnily familiar.</p>
<p>It was showing the exact scene of the match.</p>
<p>“You would have still won if you didn’t use this.”</p>
<p>“I guess I’m resembling you more these days.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I wanted a clear victory.”</p>
<p>Didn’t you say that there’s no rule against using magic during the match? So technically, I didn’t cheat, right?</p>
<p>The way he uttered each word was satisfactorily brazen.</p>
<p>It was unfathomable how this man with terribly red earlobes could ever say such a thing.</p>
<p>I grinned.</p>
<p>Yes, the more certain the victory was, the better.</p>
<p>Besides, David was the one who went against the rules. There’s no policy saying that magic was prohibited during the match.</p>
<p>Just as he mentioned, this wasn’t considered cheating.</p>
<p>And in the first place, the odds were stacked against Cassion already.</p>
<p>I wonder if they would have noticed the applied spell if it was a lost match.</p>
<p>‘Well, honestly, I would understand if they did.’</p>
<p>In any case, everyone was already expecting Cassion to win at that time.</p>
<p>It’s not as if he stole a victory that wasn’t his. It’s just that the sudden wind shortened the time he needed to win the match.</p>
<p>And made sure that his victory was more obvious.</p>
<p>Of course, with one’s own weapon.</p>
<p>Acting naïvely despite not actually being naïve, he was the kind of man who would be so flustered by a mere brush of our cheeks, but at the same time, he’s also the kind of man who’d use that kind of magic spell during a formal match.</p>
<p>I placed a hand on Cassion’s shoulder.</p>
<p>He turned towards me in surprise.</p>
<p>Boop.</p>
<p>And his soft cheek was poked squarely by my waiting finger.</p>
<p>He looked at me with a stunned gaze.</p>
<p>“Wh…at?”</p>
<p>“Even if you’re putting off crying for later, it’s still true that you overcame one hurdle. So, I have a congratulatory gift for you.”</p>
<p>“Gift?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering his question, I stood up.”</p>
<p>Cassion’s eyes followed my movements, but as I sat behind him, I turned his head straight ahead again.</p>
<p>His hair, which was the color of the night sky, had gotten long again.</p>
<p>More than last time.</p>
<p>“You need a haircut.”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I guess.”</p>
<p>His answering voice was a bit subdued.</p>
<p>It’s only natural.</p>
<p>For Cassion, his hairstyle was integral to ‘concealing his appearance’.</p>
<p>Since he’s not supposed to be alive, there should be an effort to sever any connection to Cassion’s former appearance.</p>
<p>For the sake of his survival, this act was no different than putting mud on his face and lying flat on the ground, hoping that he wouldn’t get caught.</p>
<p>And the person involved was the only one who knew how miserable and nerve-wracking this was.</p>
<p>“I’ll tell Diana.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>That was the end of their conversation about his hair.</p>
<p>There’s nothing good about prolonging this kind of atmosphere.</p>
<p>I stared at the deep blue hair covering the back of his head, then I looked down.</p>
<p>At his broad back.</p>
<p>Going further down his spine, there lay his hipbone, and then his navel at front.</p>
<p>And from the navel, about the span of one, two, three fingers side by side.</p>
<p>For a warrior trained in the martial arts such as myself, this was the spot where the inner core lay—the place that controls and stores one’s internal strength.</p>
<p>And in Cassion’s case…</p>
<p>‘The heart.’</p>
<p>There was no need to find a separate location. This was the heart, as everyone knew it, and the constantly beating organ was where his mana was being stored.</p>
<p>“Close your eyes. Take a deep breath.”</p>
<p>I reached forward and held the man’s shoulders.</p>
<p>His upright back balked and flinched lightly.</p>
<p>“Shh, relax now.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing.”</p>
<p>“It’s my gift.”</p>
<p>“But then, what kind of gift.”</p>
<p>“Have I ever asked you to do something that would harm you?”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer.</p>
<p>This was enough.</p>
<p>Consciously, tension left his rigid body.</p>
<p>I stared at Cassion’s back as he breathed in and out deeply, then with one hand, I felt around his sturdy frame.</p>
<p>It was different and unfamiliar to me, but I felt the vivid energies within him.</p>
<p>If I were to give a color to his power, it seemed like it’d be blue.</p>
<p>‘Mana.’</p>
<p>It was a distinctly different power compared to the qi that was circulating inside my own body.</p>
<p>Starting with the plate that was holding this power, and to the method to use it, everything was, naturally, different.</p>
<p>As I felt it through my fingertips, the flow of his mana was good.</p>
<p>Then, as I encountered a blocked pathway, I used my own internal strength to open it up.</p>
<p>My head started spinning, but I laboriously maintained my composure.</p>
<p>“…Uh… ugh…”</p>
<p>Before long, the owner of this back let out a suppressed groan.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 74</p>
<p>It wasn’t long until the energy presiding session ended.</p>
<p>Right, it definitely didn’t last long, but that tired me out this much.</p>
<p>Both of us exhaled at the same time.</p>
<p>Cassion placed a hand on the ground and gasped out.</p>
<p>My head started spinning.</p>
<p>I could control my own power well enough, but for me to direct someone else’s energy with my power… and to that point, a very different kind of energy, too. It felt as if I was going to die.</p>
<p>“Cough.”</p>
<p>With a cough that seemed to scratch at my throat, a metallic taste came up.</p>
<p>I wiped a corner of my mouth and soon saw blood on the back of my hand.</p>
<p>Right, it’s been calm for a while now.</p>
<p>While helping Cassion train his fighting abilities, I also trained my own stamina and my external strength.</p>
<p>I didn’t have as drastic of an improvement compared to Cassion, but I also gained quite some muscle in a short period of time.</p>
<p>With this body’s muscles improved now, my endurance limit of controlling my internal strength increased as well.</p>
<p>Recalling the time I first came to possess this body and back when I had just regained my power, even if I used my internal strength a little, it’s been a while since I vomited blood.</p>
<p>So, it’s been a while since I’ve seen blood come up like this.</p>
<p>Cough, cough.</p>
<p>After that, the dry coughing continued. Blood didn’t flood out like the first cough, but a few drops here and there fell every time I let out small coughs.</p>
<p>It seemed like it was still too much for me to direct someone else’s energy, especially if it was mana.</p>
<p>I propped myself up with one hand on the ground.</p>
<p>My coughing stopped, but for a moment, I felt light-headed as my vision spun.</p>
<p>And I felt beads of sweat streaming down my forehead.</p>
<p>‘I was once a sage transcendental’s daughter, but…’</p>
<p>I can’t believe I’m struggling with just this. If my brothers and sisters from the second round saw me like this, they surely would have laughed at the sight.</p>
<p>As I smiled quietly, my lashes fluttered.</p>
<p>Feeling how heavy my body had become, I let all the tension within me grow lax. I’d rather lie down here for a while. And I was going to.</p>
<p>If I lie down and get a bit of rest, I’ll be fine again in no time.</p>
<p>However, just before my head touched the ground, someone’s hands caught me.</p>
<p>One hand cradled the back of my head, and another hand supported my waist.</p>
<p>That person’s touch was ever so careful. Like someone holding a newborn baby.</p>
<p>Beyond my trembling eyelashes, I saw Cassion’s face. He was as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>“Rose…tta?”</p>
<p>He stammered out my name.</p>
<p>He looked so much like a frightened child that I burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. This is nothing.”</p>
<p>At my feeble reply, moisture welled up in those black eyes.</p>
<p>I could feel him putting more strength in the hand that cradled the back of my head. And soon, he brought my face to his shoulder.</p>
<p>My face, as it touched his shoulder, was cold.</p>
<p>“You’re going to worry again, aren’t you? And you’ll ask, ‘is this because of me,’ right?”</p>
<p>I asked jokingly on purpose, however he didn’t answer.</p>
<p>In the silence that blanketed the air for a moment, Cassion nodded.</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I’m worried.”</p>
<p>Speaking quietly, he looked at me with watery eyes.</p>
<p>“Every time you tell me not to worry, I go crazy as I do worry.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>All that was reflected in those black eyes was me.</p>
<p>Right, me.</p>
<p>Only me.</p>
<p>I opened my lips for a moment, but because I couldn’t think of something to answer, I closed them again.</p>
<p>Instead, I blinked slowly and reached out.</p>
<p>A cold cheek could be felt beneath my palm. With my thumb, I swept under the man’s eyes. Then, a light touch upon moisture.</p>
<p>It crossed my mind that, maybe, it tasted salty.</p>
<p>The night sky could be seen visible behind the man’s face.</p>
<p>A clear night sky, just like a clear fair day.</p>
<p>Picturesque, the stars and the moon shone brightly.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the moon, and soon, my lips opened.</p>
<p>“The funeral will be soon.”</p>
<p>That’s all I said, but Cassion seemed to understand what I meant.</p>
<p>The watery eyes gradually began to widen.</p>
<p>Besides that, the eyes, which contained only me, shook.</p>
<p>Red anger could be seen rising in those black eyes.</p>
<p>Like the red eyes of the Carter family, a truly bright red anger.</p>
<p>Pitiful Carter.</p>
<p>Pitiful Cassion.</p>
<p>Pitiful villain.</p>
<p>So, worry about yourself, not me.</p>
<p>Worry about the pitiful you, who’s about to have a funeral despite still being alive.</p>
<p>Worrying about yourself would be more worth your time compared to worrying about someone like me, who couldn’t die in all these repeated lives.</p>
<p>Thinking about the words I couldn’t utter aloud, I caressed the man’s cheek.</p>
<p>Still, his cheek was cold.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For days on end, it rained.</p>
<p>With the summer at its peak, the monsoon season—which was short if it was short, or long if it was long—began in earnest.</p>
<p>All throughout, dark clouds encroached the sky, making it almost unclear to people when the last time they saw the blue sky.</p>
<p>Then, finally, the sky cleared up.</p>
<p>After a long time, it was a summer day that was neither humid nor too hot.</p>
<p>The heat in the air was still there, but it was worth basking in the weather as the damp humidity was lost.</p>
<p>The sky, which had been hidden by overcast clouds, was brighter than ever, as if it had emerged from letting out all its frustrations.</p>
<p>The weather was fine.</p>
<p>It’s a world where green leaves, soft flowers and puddles, which had still not dried up, shone beneath the sunlight.</p>
<p>Looking at the blue sky that couldn’t be more dazzling, Rosetta turned her head when she heard someone call her, “Sister.”</p>
<p>And the owner of that voice was the main character, Alicia.</p>
<p>“It’s our turn soon, right?”</p>
<p>Nodding in reply to the small whisper, I looked around.</p>
<p>There was a throng of people.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was strangely subdued, but nevertheless, there was turmoil amidst the restraint.</p>
<p>If she looked to the side, a huge harden and a magnificent mansion could be seen.</p>
<p>It was a mansion of a similar size to the ducal residence of House Valentine, but it had a completely different ambience to it.</p>
<p>This was the Carter Duchy’s residence, where Cassion’s funeral was being held.</p>
<p>Right. Today, just as the sky cleared for the first time in a long while, was Cassion’s funeral.</p>
<p>The man who was alive, but who they hoped to die.</p>
<p>A funeral was held in a hurry despite the lack of a corpse.</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced at Cassion.</p>
<p>He was following after her, about three steps behind.</p>
<p>Because of the veil, she couldn’t see his expression well.</p>
<p>Originally, it would be better if he didn’t come.</p>
<p>This place was where Cassion lived his whole life, and also the place where the people, who tried to kill him, lived.</p>
<p>If someone were to recognize him here, all his efforts would be in vain.</p>
<p>However, for some reason or another, Cassion wanted to come to this funeral.</p>
<p>For some reason or another, he wanted to confirm his own funeral with his own eyes.</p>
<p>What kind of expression did the people who killed him were making, what kind of changes had taken place in the mansion that he wasn’t in any longer.</p>
<p>Rosetta thought about it a lot, considering the risk and the man’s request, but soon enough, she allowed him to accompany her.</p>
<p>Revenge wasn’t just a hundred-meter dash.</p>
<p>It was a marathon.</p>
<p>And, since it would take a long time, it’s always a good thing to provide adequate motivation.</p>
<p>The moment his resentment would fade, this motivation would once again make him gnash his teeth.</p>
<p>Cassion’s desire for revenge and his own survival likely wouldn’t wither away so easily, but you never know what life would bring your way.</p>
<p>And so, Rosetta allowed Cassion to accompany her despite the dangers present.</p>
<p>Look closely with both your eyes, confirm it, and let that fire burn even more.</p>
<p>If you don’t kill, you will die. If you don’t rise to the top, you will fall down.</p>
<p>This was the fate that was set in front of Cassion, and the fire within him must never be extinguished, even for a moment.</p>
<p>Well, that didn’t mean that Rosetta agreed to let him come along without any countermeasures.</p>
<p>In this world, funeral etiquette dictated that people would cover their faces.</p>
<p>Regardless of age and gender, putting on a veil was commonly done to mourn the death of another.</p>
<p>That’s why the droves of people around them all had their faces covered with a variety of veils.</p>
<p>Most nobles had veils that covered until the top of their noses.</p>
<p>Of course, this was because they still needed to know who’s who.</p>
<p>However, it was common for the servants and escort knights who followed them to use veils that covered their entire faces. This was according to tradition.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s entourage was no different.</p>
<p>The two sisters both covered their faces with a white veil made of woven mesh. On the other hand, Cassion’s face was covered with a thicker, longer veil.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked at the veil that was covering his face.</p>
<p>Perhaps where his eyes were.</p>
<p>His eyes couldn’t be seen because of the fabric that covered both their faces.</p>
<p>Then, her gold gaze went down a little.</p>
<p>Instead of gauging through Cassion’s hidden face, she checked his condition through other ways.</p>
<p>For example, though his stiff shoulders and tightly clenched fists.</p>
<p>‘…You’re really stiff, huh.’</p>
<p>Though trivial, she wanted to ask him if he was alright and offer some consolation, but she couldn’t do so because there were many eyes around them.</p>
<p>Rosetta had no choice but to turn around.</p>
<p>“Sister, are you alright?”</p>
<p>Soon, Alicia uttered this question.</p>
<p>She was looking up at the sky just now, then looked behind her and fell silent. She even looked worried.</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled faintly and nodded once more.</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m alright. Besides that… You haven’t forgotten what I told you earlier, have you?”</p>
<p>She said these words with a tone laden with stealth and caution. It was rare, but her voice even contained a bit of tension.</p>
<p>Alicia clenched her small fists and nodded vigorously.</p>
<p>“Of course. Never take off my veil and never engage Young Duke Leo in any conversation apart from offering my condolences.”</p>
<p>She answered bravely, but Rosetta couldn’t be at ease.</p>
<p>A white dress, a white hat, a white veil.</p>
<p>As she was in all white, her blonde hair shone particularly beautifully, and its golden luster over the veil was dazzling.</p>
<p>As if this thin sheet of fabric was not enough to mask her beauty.</p>
<p>This beauty was what worried her.</p>
<p>Today was Cassion’s funeral, and this was the first scene that would mark the beginning of the original novel.</p>
<p>In the original, Cassion’s funeral.</p>
<p>If they were to consider fate, it was on this day that Alicia would catch Leo’s interest.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Her thoughts became complicated just being reminded of it. Or, no, did it stop at just being complicated? It felt as if she was going to implode.</p>
<p>In the middle of all that, Alicia was shining right beside her, so she felt even more frustrated.</p>
<p>‘Right, you’re this pretty, so it would be more strange if the other person wouldn’t be interested.’</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Alicia was so especially beautiful today that it came to a point where Rosetta had such thoughts.</p>
<p>As if fate was keen on being on track, it had cast a halo upon her to make her shine.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 75</p>
<p>There were many attendees, so people had to line up so that they may pay their respects to the dead.</p>
<p>When the members of House Valentine had arrived, people tried to give up their spots on the line, but the duke refused.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t the kind of person who would cut in lines.</p>
<p>Soon enough, it was House Valentine’s turn.</p>
<p>Duke Valentine and Damian went ahead towards Duke and Duchess Carter.</p>
<p>Originally, only Duke Valentine would have headed towards Duke and Duchess Carter, and Damian should have approached Leo.</p>
<p>Matching each other’s stature was only natural, wasn’t it?</p>
<p>The head of the household would match the head of the household, while the successor would match the successor.</p>
<p>However, since Leo had yet to be formally announced as the ducal household’s successor, Damian instead approached Duke and Duchess Carter.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, it was up to Alicia and Rosetta to greet Leo and offer their condolences.</p>
<p>That’s how it was in the original work, and now, that’s how it is in reality.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s steps were heavy as she walked closer to the tall man, until she stood right in front of him.</p>
<p>As if standing in front of an enemy, she felt chills to her core.</p>
<p>All she thought was that she wanted to hide Alicia behind her.</p>
<p>The man’s shoes entered her sight.</p>
<p>For a moment, the shoes from that nightmare of the past came to mind, and at this, she couldn’t help but grimace.</p>
<p>However, Rosetta schooled her features. And with a light sigh, she then looked up.</p>
<p>It was customary for the bereaved family not to wear any veils on their faces, so when she looked up, she saw the man’s face.</p>
<p>‘…He’s handsome.’</p>
<p>Laughably enough, this was Rosetta’s first impression of Leo.</p>
<p>Red hair, red eyes, red lips.</p>
<p>As though covered in blood, the crimson man was a marvelously handsome man.</p>
<p>His sharp eyes resembled Cassion’s, but other than that, his appearance and overall atmosphere was different.</p>
<p>As Cassion was a handsome man who had a sorrowful and neat air to him, then this other man had the kind of atmosphere that was incredibly dense.</p>
<p>If she were to put it into words, he looked exactly like how the male lead of a trashy angst novel would look like.</p>
<p>As Rosetta came to this conclusion, one of her brows was slightly raised beneath her veil.</p>
<p>Yeah, what’s the point of being handsome, huh. No matter how you look at him, he’s just a lunatic male lead.</p>
<p>While she felt bitter about this, Leo lightly nodded and greeted her.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming, Ducal Lady Valentine.”</p>
<p>“It brings me sorrow that we have to meet under these circumstances, Young Duke.”</p>
<p>They briefly exchanged formal greetings like this.</p>
<p>“I heard it was an accident.”</p>
<p>When Rosetta asked, a pained smile graced Leo’s lips, then he nodded once more.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what happened. It was such a terrible accident that we couldn’t even recover his body.”</p>
<p>Following the pained smile, even his voice sounded as if it was laced with despair.</p>
<p>How dare anyone even think that he was the culprit behind all this.</p>
<p>“Goodness, you must be terribly heartbroken.”</p>
<p>“…Losing a family member… It’s more shocking than I ever thought.”</p>
<p>How shameless.</p>
<p>To match that shamelessness, Rosetta didn’t step down either.</p>
<p>Pressing her lips together first, she then let out a small murmur so filled with regret.</p>
<p>“I do hope you regain your peace of mind.”</p>
<p>Saying this, she held out her hand, with the undertone of wanting to end the conversation here.</p>
<p>Leo stared at her outstretched hand for a moment, then he leisurely clasped her hand.</p>
<p>The large fingers of the man’s hands wrapped around the woman’s hand and shook it lightly.</p>
<p>“Thank you again for coming, Ducal Lady.”</p>
<p>“My condolences again, Young Duke.”</p>
<p>After that short handshake, Rosetta stepped aside.</p>
<p>That step was lithe, yet heavy.</p>
<p>As though changing masks in a theater play, her solemn eyes changed in that instance.</p>
<p>At last, the moment had come.</p>
<p>The moment of Alicia and Leo’s first meeting.</p>
<p>The very moment where the novel would begin.</p>
<p>Hidden beneath the veil, Rosetta’s gaze was fastened upon Alicia.</p>
<p>In her mind, all she could think of was the line in the original work that started it all.</p>
<p>〈 Leo’s red eyes were fixed upon the woman who was much too pale. 〉</p>
<p>The male lead, who she wanted so much to erase, and the female lead, who she wanted so much to protect. They faced each other now, and this sight alone made her blood run cold.</p>
<p>When Rosetta stepped aside, Alicia stood in the place she once was.</p>
<p>No matter who looked at Alicia, it was obvious how very nervous she was.</p>
<p>It was only natural since she hadn’t gone out that much, let alone attended a high society event.</p>
<p>This was because Katie had been afraid of her abuse of the girl being exposed to the world.</p>
<p>The same went for the original Rosetta.</p>
<p>In any case, he was a stranger. How nervous must she be feeling to stand in front of a man with such striking looks and such a sharp air around him.</p>
<p>“M…My condolences, Young Duke.”</p>
<p>Her stuttering voice sounded pitiable.</p>
<p>Even a handful of words was difficult for her to utter, then she paused for a moment and bowed her head in a hurry.</p>
<p>Rosetta sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>‘Ha, adorable.’</p>
<p>She was adorable even to Rosetta.</p>
<p>Yeah, who wouldn’t fall for her.</p>
<p>While Rosetta thought so, Alicia raised her head.</p>
<p>Unlike her older sister’s reaction to the clumsy greeting, she was embarrassed, and so her porcelain cheeks were dyed red.</p>
<p>Leo’s gaze looked beyond the veil and settled upon the eyes beneath those fluttering lashes.</p>
<p>“Thank you for coming, Princess. My older brother would have been delighted to know that you’ve come.”</p>
<p>Alicia was just looking away into the air, but at the eloquently said answer, her gaze turned back to the man before her.</p>
<p>She plucked the courage to speak again.</p>
<p>“It… It truly i…is a pity that…”</p>
<p>However, her words stopped there.</p>
<p>The corners of her eyes started turning as red as her cheeks.</p>
<p>Along with the onset of tears, her voice trembled.</p>
<p>‘What do I do?’</p>
<p>Alicia clenched her lips.</p>
<p>If she didn’t, she might cry right then and there.</p>
<p>Because Alicia didn’t know the whole story, to her, Leo was nothing but a man who had lost his beloved older brother.</p>
<p>She also had older siblings, so she sympathized with him, thinking about how shattered her heart would have been if she was in his position.</p>
<p>Being the softhearted girl that she was, it would be strange if Alicia didn’t cry in a situation like this.</p>
<p>Tears soon began to well up in those round eyes.</p>
<p>Every time those eyes grew even more wet, Rosetta could feel her insides burning more.</p>
<p>Of course, the veil over her face wouldn’t let it show clearly, but…</p>
<p>Right there, why was it so obvious that tears were hanging on the very tip of her long eyelashes?</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>The moment she saw the beads of moisture at the end of those lashes, she had just one thought.</p>
<p>That she had to stop Alicia from crying.</p>
<p>At least, as long as she was still in front of Leo.</p>
<p>It was when Alicia had tearfully offered her condolences that Leo’s interest in her began.</p>
<p>He was a man who had never once thought of crying for others.</p>
<p>Seeing Alicia mourning the death of a complete and utter stranger came to him as a fresh shock.</p>
<p>At first glance, this was a terribly cliché first meeting.</p>
<p>However, Rosetta knew the horrifying consequences of that cliché.</p>
<p>The dewy eyelashes slowly blinked. The beads that formed at the end shook dangerously.</p>
<p>They were about to fall.</p>
<p>But then, just as that small bead was about to trickle down her cheek,</p>
<p>Before Alicia could shed her tears, someone else’s sobs broke through the air.</p>
<p>“Hiic.”</p>
<p>The wracking sob sounded as if all her frustrations were about to burst through, and it was enough to catch everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>Cassion, Alicia, Leo.</p>
<p>Not only them, but even Duke Valentine and Damian, who were some ways away, conversing with Duke and Duchess Carter.</p>
<p>As though orchestrated, everyone’s eyes turned to one single place.</p>
<p>Towards Rosetta Valentine, the master of crying.</p>
<p>As she covered her lips from beneath the veil, her trembling shoulders would make anyone pity her.</p>
<p>“Sister!”</p>
<p>Surprised, Alicia immediately went to her older sister’s side, embracing her trembling shoulders.</p>
<p>The moisture in those eyelashes were long gone.</p>
<p>Rosetta furtively glanced at Alicia with a cloudy gaze, and when she saw that the tears had stopped, she was inwardly relieved.</p>
<p>‘It worked.’</p>
<p>Of course, her own crying was a ruse.</p>
<p>If the keyword ‘tears’ was what made a strong first impression, wouldn’t it be possible to twist fate if it was someone else who did the ‘crying’?</p>
<p>As a result, Alicia’s own tears also stopped.</p>
<p>Rosetta turned her head to the side.</p>
<p>Still, she did not stop sobbing.</p>
<p>“Are you alright, Princess?”</p>
<p>Leo held out a handkerchief to Rosetta, whose tears continued to flow.</p>
<p>The bereaved was comforting a guest.</p>
<p>Pale fingertips took the handkerchief, which fluttered in the air as her hand trembled.</p>
<p>As she wiped her tears underneath the veil, Rosetta spoke.</p>
<p>“…I’m sorry. I don’t know what came over me, but I apologize for my discourtesy.”</p>
<p>A regretful voice uttered an apology, then one hand steered Alicia away.</p>
<p>Evidently embarrassed, Rosetta curtsied and hurriedly turned away.</p>
<p>It was a very natural exit.</p>
<p>To the point that no one noticed that Alicia hadn’t finished speaking.</p>
<p>No, well, there was still one person who did.</p>
<p>There was one person who’s been observing the atmosphere.</p>
<p>From the moment he entered the residence, his body was taut with tension as he was hyper-aware of everything around him.</p>
<p>Maxwell, who was also Cassion.</p>
<p>The main character of this funeral.</p>
<p>Even at the very moment Rosetta burst into tears, he noticed that she was just acting.</p>
<p>And so, too, did he notice for what purpose this act was.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the place where the funeral was being held, he heard the warning about ‘Alicia and Leo’s first meeting’, so he had no doubt about it.</p>
<p>However, when he saw her small back trembling, he felt that something was off.</p>
<p>It rolled like waves within him.</p>
<p>These waves rose higher, seemingly creating a murky, bubbling foam that filled his chest.</p>
<p>When Cassion heard Leo mention him with that abominable acting, his heart grew unusually cold, however…</p>
<p>When he heard those sobs, even if they were just a mere trick, his cold heart shook and throbbed.</p>
<p>Burning sorrow and now-meaningless emotions rose up and lodged themselves at his throat, heating him up.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s because it’s the first time he’s seeing her cry for anyone.</p>
<p>Perhaps, because he knew that those tears had been shed for her younger sister, not for himself.</p>
<p>It was a laughably strange thing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he was thankful for the veil covering his face.</p>
<p>This way, he could hide his own damp eyes.</p>
<p>This way, he could hide his adam’s apple, which bobbed up and down as he gulped dryly.</p>
<p>This way, nobody would be able to see the unexpected yearning that was hitting him like waves.</p>
<p>He followed Rosetta’s steps and, without any hesitation, looked away from Leo.</p>
<p>This hellish mansion.</p>
<p>This younger brother, who tried to kill him.</p>
<p>Those pretentiously weeping parents.</p>
<p>Everything was behind him as he turned away, but oddly enough, he was more concerned about the pitiful back of the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>Really, truly. What a mystery.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 76</p>
<p>Meanwhile, over here.</p>
<p>Other people’s thoughts had become complicated, though it was in a different sense compared to Cassion’s contemplation.</p>
<p>It was Duke Valentine and Damian.</p>
<p>The moment Rosetta shed tears, the formal conversation they were having with Duke and Duchess Carter grinded to a halt.</p>
<p>Quietly observing, their eyes followed after Rosetta’s retreating figure as she left.</p>
<p>Beneath those wordless gazes, the silence that couldn’t be hidden sank further.</p>
<p>Both men were seeing Rosetta cry for the first time.</p>
<p>From the time she entered the household until this very moment, she never cried in front of Damian and the duke.</p>
<p>No. Perhaps she was crying while she was behind them.</p>
<p>But it was the first time they saw Rosetta shed any tears. At least, as far as they could recall.</p>
<p>‘Rosetta’s crying?’</p>
<p>As though they were two people who had witnessed something unimaginable, they both froze in their places, at a loss for words.</p>
<p>Then, Damian became aware of Leo Carter, who was standing in front of her.</p>
<p>The shock of Rosetta’s tears weighed heavily on his chest, but he soon remembered where they were right now.</p>
<p>This was Cassion Carter’s funeral.</p>
<p>It was an occasion in memory of the departed Cassion Carter, the elder son who was also known as the ‘Useless Carter’.</p>
<p>It was a matter within the household, so he didn’t know the details. However.</p>
<p>From what he knew of Duke Carter’s nature, he could only surmise that the treatment they had given Cassion wouldn’t be too far from that disgraceful nickname.</p>
<p>Damian and Leo Carter had met face to face at some high society events.</p>
<p>This enough meant that House Carter actively let their children participate in these social functions.</p>
<p>However, Damian couldn’t even remember the last time he saw Cassion, who was older than Leo.</p>
<p>His hair was black, and his eyes must be red.</p>
<p>As he thought about Cassion’s appearance, all he could remember about him were these characteristics.</p>
<p>Two sons had been born under this roof, both with the right to succeed the family. One son showed his face freely, but why was the other son hiding so thoroughly?</p>
<p>There was not one nobleman or noblewoman who couldn’t grasp what this meant.</p>
<p>Right. Today was the funeral of that Cassion Carter.</p>
<p>The funeral of someone who had been regarded as the ‘Useless Carter’ both internally and externally.</p>
<p>It was in such a place that he first saw Rosetta’s tears.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was inevitable that Damian would think, ‘Perhaps’.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps, do you think you’re sympathizing because you think you’re in the same position as him?’</p>
<p>He didn’t want to admit it, but it’s obvious that Cassion and Rosetta had very similar situations.</p>
<p>There was an obvious attempt at not discriminating between Alicia and Rosetta when it came to their positions in the household as official daughters of the duchy, as well as when it came to the material belongings that they were allowed. However, the unbiased treatment stopped there.</p>
<p>Hadn’t Rosetta already acknowledged his attitude towards him?</p>
<p>Hadn’t Rosetta already pointed out how both he and their father were uncomfortable around her? How they still were?</p>
<p>When she had asked him to accept Cassion as her escort knight back then, what she said that time was enough to cement this fact.</p>
<p>‘To be honest, I was lonely sometimes. I… I actually know everything. Brother and Father are uncomfortable with me.’</p>
<p>Where, then.</p>
<p>It seemed as if Cassion and Rosetta had nothing in common at all.</p>
<p>The Carter son who had been ostracized for not having any powers. And, the illegitimate ducal lady who had been born through the sins of one maid.</p>
<p>Rosetta was a quick-witted child, so she wouldn’t have been unaware of this.</p>
<p>Even so, doubts and thoughts that started with ‘perhaps’ hardened into conviction as time passed by.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s tears were not shed only to mourn another person’s death, but they were shed to mourn the death of someone similar to herself.</p>
<p>She pretended to be fine. However, she must have been absolutely torn.</p>
<p>She couldn’t bear to cry for herself, and yet, she sympathized with and cried because of the fate of a young man who was in a similar situation as her.</p>
<p>Feeling his throat tighten, Damian dryly gulped.</p>
<p>But beside Damian, the duke’s expression was blank.</p>
<p>There, a sense of guilt. Of repentance.</p>
<p>None of that could be seen in the expression he had right now. Just, his pale face made him look as though he’d seen a ghost.</p>
<p>‘She resembles her.’</p>
<p>Rosetta’s side profile.</p>
<p>The distance between them.</p>
<p>Her back as she had turned away.</p>
<p>She resembled the woman he had missed so very much.</p>
<p>It’s been more than ten years, but it was that woman. The only Duchess of Valentine—his beloved wife.</p>
<p>At that moment, he saw an image of Lilian.</p>
<p>However, no, that can’t be… That’s impossible.</p>
<p>Wasn’t Rosetta the daughter of that atrocious woman?</p>
<p>Lilian had cared for that woman as though they were sisters, and yet that woman betrayed the duchess and gave birth to a child out of greed.</p>
<p>And the result of that avaricious desire was Rosetta.</p>
<p>Lilian’s final words made it possible for that child to be entered into the household and thus treated as an esteemed daughter of the duchy. But that was all.</p>
<p>The duke never once considered Rosetta his daughter.</p>
<p>Even here, he still does not consider her his daughter.</p>
<p>Right, that’s what he certainly felt, however…</p>
<p>Just why was Lilian’s apparition overlapping with that child’s crying figure?</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>Unconsciously, his stiff lips opened and called her.</p>
<p>Hearing the duke call her name, Rosetta stopped. As though she herself was a rusty machine, she turned her head stiffly.</p>
<p>She was slightly surprised by him unexpectedly calling out to her.</p>
<p>One tearful gaze, one blank gaze. They met in the air.</p>
<p>“…Father?”</p>
<p>Rosetta was the first to speak because the person who had called her wasn’t saying anything.</p>
<p>Only then did the awareness enter the duke’s blank gaze once more.</p>
<p>His lips moved slightly for a moment, but he eventually spoke with a stern expression.</p>
<p>“If you’re not feeling well, you can go back first.”</p>
<p>It was a constrained voice.</p>
<p>With a tone like that, you wouldn’t be able to guess that it was a father speaking towards his daughter.</p>
<p>Even so, the words itself expressed concern. Rosetta was perplexed by this.</p>
<p>Whether kind or unkind, just the word ‘concern’ itself did not suit Duke Valentine.</p>
<p>She nodded woodenly.</p>
<p>“…Thank you for your concern.”</p>
<p>Feeling the eyes of others on them, she answered awkwardly and turned her back on them once more.</p>
<p>The duke and Damian still had their feet rooted to that place, and so they watched the two sisters walk away.</p>
<p>The duke’s fingertips were weak, but they were shaking.</p>
<p>When Lilian had passed away, he thought that he had cast away all of his emotions.</p>
<p>But as he felt his fingertips tremble, he thought that this wasn’t the case.</p>
<p>He never thought that Rosetta’s tears would ever cause such a stir within him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘Rosetta.’</p>
<p>‘If you’re not feeling well, you can go back first.’</p>
<p>…What the hell was that earlier.</p>
<p>This was what Rosetta thought as she lightly wiped her tears beneath the veil.</p>
<p>It’s good that she could leave with Alicia, but she felt a strange sense of discomfort.</p>
<p>It felt as if there’s something holding her ankle back.</p>
<p>Far from worrying about her, she knew that she’s lucky enough that the duke did not loathe her.</p>
<p>She couldn’t believe that such a person said something that remotely sounded like concern.</p>
<p>No, never mind.</p>
<p>…Just stop thinking nonsense.</p>
<p>Truthfully, what mattered right now was not this strange feeling of discomfort.</p>
<p>〈 This person. It’s the first time I’ve met such a woman. 〉</p>
<p>This clichéd beginning. It’s gone now.</p>
<p>That’s what’s important.</p>
<p>The original work did not even begin.</p>
<p>Firstly, it’s obvious that they’d jumped over a hurdle through this.</p>
<p>“Are you alright, Sister?”</p>
<p>Just in time, Alicia asked her.</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded as she struggled to keep the corners of her lips down.</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’m fine now.”</p>
<p>That voice was ever so sweet.</p>
<p>Soon, Rosetta caressed Alicia’s golden hair with a soft touch.</p>
<p>She was truly satisfied that she was able to protect this blonde girl, the novel’s main character.</p>
<p>Rosetta stroked Alicia’s hair for a while, then she looked around them.</p>
<p>Through her veil, all she could see was this huge crowd of people.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was a funeral for House Carter’s eldest son.</p>
<p>For the nobles, today’s funeral was not being held just to pay respects to the dead. It was a ‘high society event.’</p>
<p>Besides that, it wasn’t just some ordinary aristocrat’s event, but one that’s held in a duke’s house. It’s natural that everyone had scrambled to come through the gates.</p>
<p>Still, not one person in this crowd truly felt any sorrow for the deceased.</p>
<p>From a distance away—haha, ohoho—laughter could even be heard.</p>
<p>In any case, it was a cruel thing to do.</p>
<p>There were so many things in this human world that were not humane.</p>
<p>But what use was there to question such a world.</p>
<p>It’s like this, that’s why Leo had been interested in Alicia in the original.</p>
<p>〈 For someone else… And for a complete stranger, too. The first person who’s shown such remorse was this woman. 〉</p>
<p>How rotten the world must have been for a man to feel novelty in a woman who cried only a little at a funeral.</p>
<p>Rosetta let out a small sigh, her lips twisting underneath the veil.</p>
<p>The golden eyes that looked around were cold.</p>
<p>‘For now… Let’s go.’</p>
<p>She was worried about how Cassion was hearing laughter at his own funeral.</p>
<p>She couldn’t see his facial expressions through their veils, but it was clear that he wasn’t in the best of moods.</p>
<p>This should be enough motivation.</p>
<p>Excessive provocation would only cause anger, that’s why this much should be enough.</p>
<p>‘Besides…’</p>
<p>Just in case, she was worried that today’s success would turn into a failure.</p>
<p>She made an effort to eradicate the first scene. However, it was a fact that couldn’t be changed—that this was a dangerous place.</p>
<p>Cassion’s funeral was the setting for an intense first meeting.</p>
<p>She couldn’t waste her efforts thus far.</p>
<p>She wanted to leave this place after a successful start. At least, for today.</p>
<p>Some would say that the beginning was half the battle.</p>
<p>The duke had also told her that she could go back first if she wasn’t feeling well, so that’s a good enough reason to leave in the middle of the funeral.</p>
<p>It was awkward, but fortunate.</p>
<p>Rosetta thought far ahead, then, one after another, she glanced at the two people standing next to her.</p>
<p>“Let’s go back first, Alicia, Maxwell.”</p>
<p>Hearing the weak voice, Alicia nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, Sister. It seems like you’re still not feeling well… Let’s go back so you can rest.”</p>
<p>Alicia was also relieved by this because she also felt uneasy having to be amidst this large crowd.</p>
<p>Of course, the biggest reason she wanted to leave was because she was worried about Rosetta.</p>
<p>“Then, I shall be escorting you back.”</p>
<p>Cassion replied without any hesitation.</p>
<p>The trio soon headed towards the west gate.</p>
<p>The east gate was still very crowded, so they chose to go through a gate that was meant only for people, not vehicles.</p>
<p>It was so loud that they continued to hear this and that, and it was tiring because they kept getting stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>There’s a saying that the more you’re in a hurry, the more you’ll be pushed back.</p>
<p>As a result, the choice they made turned out to be the wrong choice in that regard.</p>
<p>They chose the west gate because they wanted to leave this place even a moment faster, but in the end, they were still held up on their way there.</p>
<p>What stopped them in their tracks was the voice of a stranger from some distance away.</p>
<p>“Excuse me!”</p>
<p>The garden they were passing through was empty.</p>
<p>There was no one there, but it was definitely the voice of a man—a person.</p>
<p>Rosetta turned her head towards the direction of that voice.</p>
<p>But the place where that voice came from was none other than a tree.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 77</p>
<p>The trio stopped at the same time as they heard the sudden call.</p>
<p>Startled, Alicia clung onto Rosetta by her sleeve.</p>
<p>As they looked up at the tree where that sound came from, the stranger’s voice shouted once more as though welcoming them.</p>
<p>“Here, over here!”</p>
<p>The owner of that voice was found to be sitting on a thick branch of a tree, waving at them.</p>
<p>Without a veil on his face, there was nothing covering his features.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, the man’s pale, platinum blond hair and blue eyes, which had the shade of the summer sky, could clearly be seen.</p>
<p>‘Blue eyes…’</p>
<p>Rosetta confirmed the man’s eyes and searched her thoughts.</p>
<p>In this world, House Valentine was known for their golden eyes while House Carter was known for their red eyes. And, there was another household known for those azure eyes.</p>
<p>It was the ‘Duchy of Freesia’, one of the three pillars of the empire.</p>
<p>Right, that man clearly hailed from House Freesia.</p>
<p>Rosetta raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>In the middle of those slightly raised eyebrows, there was a small crease on her forehead.</p>
<p>If it was someone from any other noble household, they would have been able to pass by without acknowledging him. However, since that man was someone from a duchy, it was impossible not to greet him.</p>
<p>The veil that was covering her face was just a mesh fabric that was see-through, so he must have already noticed from which family she was from.</p>
<p>While Rosetta thought about many things, the man still continued to wave.</p>
<p>Every time he waved, the leaves hanging from the branches shook along with his movements.</p>
<p>Then, when the branch he was sitting on shook dangerously, the man stopped waving and blinked.</p>
<p>Slowly, he held onto the branch with one hand and leaned forward.</p>
<p>With an awkward smile, he spoke.</p>
<p>“Um… Ladies of House Valentine. It’s a coincidence that we met here, but may I ask for your help?”</p>
<p>‘I knew it.’</p>
<p>Rosetta let out a small sigh when he said ‘Ladies of House Valentine.’</p>
<p>She only thought that he might have noticed, but it was only a guess earlier.</p>
<p>“…What’s the matter, Young Duke?”</p>
<p>Rosetta replied lightly.</p>
<p>“It’s just… I came to help a cat because it looked like it couldn’t go down, but I couldn’t go down myself in the end because it’s scarier than I thought.”</p>
<p>“…Cat?”</p>
<p>Hearing the man’s trivial reason, Rosetta looked at his arms.</p>
<p>Sure enough, there was a cat in his arms just as he thought.</p>
<p>It was a cat that had bright blue eyes and black fur, but it was trembling as though it was terribly frightened.</p>
<p>Perhaps he felt Rosetta’s gaze, but the man gently patted the cat’s round head.</p>
<p>“Shall we help you go down?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Please do, Princess.”</p>
<p>“…May we call someone else then?”</p>
<p>“No. Um, it’s just…”</p>
<p>The man trailed off, shaking his head awkwardly.</p>
<p>He glanced around for a moment, then he spoke in a whisper as though it was a secret.</p>
<p>“Can’t you just help me personally?”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>Bewildered, Rosetta asked back. However, the man just bit his lower lip.</p>
<p>All Rosetta thought was that this man had no shame.</p>
<p>“I mean… I feel like people will laugh at me if they find out I shouted, ‘Please help me get down from this tree!’ And especially during a funeral…”</p>
<p>Well, he was at least still thinking about his family’s reputation.</p>
<p>After he whispered these words, the man smiled.</p>
<p>It looked like the bashful smile of a shy young man.</p>
<p>‘I wonder if he doesn’t think it’s shameful to ask me.’</p>
<p>Of course, Rosetta wasn’t moved by the boyish smile or anything.</p>
<p>‘You shouldn’t have done something shameful in the first place.’</p>
<p>Rosetta pushed down the cold criticism she had against the man. She nodded.</p>
<p>It was a reluctant yes.</p>
<p>Noticing this, the man smiled broadly.</p>
<p>Truthfully, it wasn’t that difficult to help a man down from a tree.</p>
<p>She just didn’t want to be entangled with anyone else anymore, and all she needed to do was ask someone else.</p>
<p>“Maxwell, help him.”</p>
<p>Rosetta whispered towards Cassion. At this, he bowed and soon approached the tree.</p>
<p>The tall Cassion climbed the tree effortlessly.</p>
<p>In just three moves, he reached the branch where the man was sitting. Then, supporting the man from the side, he jumped down to the ground with him.</p>
<p>There was a slight recoil, but that was all.</p>
<p>When the veil was raised for a moment, the expression he had was nonchalant and calm.</p>
<p>Cassion steadied the man on his side.</p>
<p>Blinking in surprise, the man burst into laughter and thanked Cassion.</p>
<p>With his unoccupied hand, tap tap, the man dusted off his wrinkled collar. Then, he stood in front of Rosetta and Alicia.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Your Ladyship. You definitely helped me save face.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t anything difficult, well. In the future, please ask someone else to do it. Don’t go up there yourself.”</p>
<p>“Yes. I only did it this time without realizing it. I shouldn’t even look at a tree that I can’t climb.”</p>
<p>As he answered, the man scratched the cat beneath its chin.</p>
<p>“Other people should be the same, too. So that they won’t make the same mistake as me.”</p>
<p>Right, Butterfly?</p>
<p>The man muttered to the cat, petting its face.</p>
<p>As if answering him, the cat mewled pleasantly.</p>
<p>Alicia, who had been standing behind Rosetta all this time, peeked out when she heard the cat.</p>
<p>The eyes that were looking at the cat were sparkling brightly.</p>
<p>The look on her face was obviously saying, ‘I want to pet it, even just once.’</p>
<p>Noticing Alicia’s interest, the man raised his head.</p>
<p>He looked between Alicia and the cat alternately, then he chuckled softly. Then, he held out a hand with the cat on it.</p>
<p>“Would you like to hold it?”</p>
<p>“…H…Huh?”</p>
<p>Caught peeking, Alicia stuttered.</p>
<p>“Would you like to pet it?”</p>
<p>The bewildered golden eyes shook greatly.</p>
<p>She was very confused at that moment, but it still seemed like she wanted to hold it.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t have the courage to come close to a stranger.</p>
<p>When Rosetta noticed this, she held Alicia’s arm and whispered quietly.</p>
<p>“Try and hold it. When would you ever have the chance again?”</p>
<p>Her long eyelashes were quivering.</p>
<p>However, soon enough.</p>
<p>Alicia slowly held out her hands, which seemed to be shaking just as much as her nerves were.</p>
<p>“Then… please.”</p>
<p>At the timid woman’s small act of courage, the man smiled and gave her the cat.</p>
<p>Holding the cat in her arms now, Alicia smiled shyly.</p>
<p>For a moment, the man was dazed. But then, he turned to Rosetta and gulped dryly.</p>
<p>“Um, thank you again for helping me, Your Ladyship. May I ask for your name?”</p>
<p>Somewhere along his words, there was a hint of nervousness.</p>
<p>Rosetta turned away from Alicia, then she looked at the man.</p>
<p>The warmth that had been on his expression disappeared.</p>
<p>She glanced at the man with a subtle expression, however she soon drew a smile on her lips.</p>
<p>“I am Rosetta Valentine. This is my younger sister, Alicia Valentine.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yes, I am Alicia Valentine.”</p>
<p>She was busy petting the cat, but she bowed slightly and introduced herself.</p>
<p>With a loving gaze, Rosetta glanced towards Alicia. Then, she spoke once more.</p>
<p>“The one who helped you is my escort knight, Maxwell.”</p>
<p>“I am Maxwell, sir.”</p>
<p>Cassion also stepped forward and stood next to Rosetta, introducing himself.</p>
<p>As he moved, the drooping veil shook as well.</p>
<p>After the three introduced themselves one after another, the man slowly repeated the names in his mind.</p>
<p>‘Rosetta. Alicia. Maxwell.’</p>
<p>And, again. Rosetta.</p>
<p>While he silently repeated the name in his mind, a short period of silence stretched between them, but the man eventually gave his belated introduction.</p>
<p>“I am Daniel. Daniel Freesia.”</p>
<p>Daniel Freesia?</p>
<p>“…The youngest brother of Duke Freesia…?”</p>
<p>At the mention of the name ‘Daniel’, Rosetta confirmed the information she knew about him. In return, that man—Daniel—nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“…Aha.”</p>
<p>Daniel Freesia.</p>
<p>The name rang a bell amidst the real Rosetta’s memories, and it was also a name that could be seen many times throughout the original novel.</p>
<p>He didn’t have a major role in the novel, but he was famous for being the very youngest member of House Freesia.</p>
<p>He was the youngest brother of the current Duke of Freesia, and he’s been ill since birth.</p>
<p>His entire family thought him to be praiseworthy for even just being able to breathe and stay alive thus far. That’s how much their love for the youngest continued.</p>
<p>Their affection for him began when he was still young, and it hadn’t changed even in the present day even when he was nearing the age of adulthood.</p>
<p>And this wouldn’t change in the future either.</p>
<p>In any noble household, when one of the siblings had taken up the position as the head of the family, it was only natural for the others to become independent and take on different titles. However…</p>
<p>As he occasionally appeared as a minor character in the novel, Daniel continued to live in the duke’s residence even after he came of age.</p>
<p>Still with the title of ‘Young Duke’.</p>
<p>It was as if the duke couldn’t cherish his youngest brother enough. It was the duke’s choice to coddle Daniel.</p>
<p>‘Well, it’s a good thing I helped you out.’</p>
<p>With this, Duke Freesia was going to owe her a favor, so this wasn’t that bad.</p>
<p>Since she helped the youngest sibling, couldn’t she ask for their help later?</p>
<p>She didn’t know if such a day would come, but she was willing to take any opportunity that would come her way.</p>
<p>“Ouch!”</p>
<p>As Rosetta was immersed in her thoughts of Daniel for a while, a small exclamation suddenly rang out from behind her.</p>
<p>The owner of that small yelp was Alicia.</p>
<p>Rosetta turned around in surprise.</p>
<p>Her silver hair fluttered in the air as she moved.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Alicia.”</p>
<p>“Sister…”</p>
<p>Alicia wept, clutching the back of her hand. The cat that had been in her embrace earlier was now nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>However, she still saw the retreating figure of the black cat as it disappeared into the shrubbery.</p>
<p>It seemed to have run away after biting Alicia’s hand.</p>
<p>“Are you alright? Let me see it.”</p>
<p>Rosetta anxiously examined Alicia’s hand.</p>
<p>Drops of blood emerged from the soft skin.</p>
<p>Seeing the brilliant pigment that contrasted with her pale skin, Alicia soon became tearful.</p>
<p>Because she had long-standing memories of being abused, she was very afraid of pain.</p>
<p>Rosetta rummaged through her pockets to find her handkerchief.</p>
<p>Before she could, Daniel held out a handkerchief of his own.</p>
<p>Alicia’s moist eyes turned towards Daniel.</p>
<p>He looked at the back of Alicia’s hand anxiously, then he spoke cautiously.</p>
<p>“For a moment, may I?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Instead of explaining, Daniel offered his hand along with the handkerchief.</p>
<p>Rosetta didn’t stop him.</p>
<p>She knew what he was about to do.</p>
<p>There were three noble households that were the pillars of this empire.</p>
<p>Among them, House Freesia was the family that reigned over ‘divine power’.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 78</p>
<p>Daniel’s hand gingerly covered Alicia’s wound.</p>
<p>Soon, as his eyes turned downward, white light appeared at the same time as he murmured. The wound on the back of Alicia’s hand began to fade away.</p>
<p>Only a small amount of divine power was enough because it was just a slight wound.</p>
<p>“Whoa…”</p>
<p>Alicia looked at her hand with wonder.</p>
<p>It was her first time personally seeing and experiencing divine power, so she was amazed by it.</p>
<p>The only indication that there had been a wound there before was a faint drop of blood.</p>
<p>“How is it? It doesn’t hurt anymore, right?”</p>
<p>With a smile, Daniel asked. At this, Alicia replied with a slight red tinge on her cheeks.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Her fear towards the stranger had disappeared along with the wound, and now, all that’s left were her diminished shyness and red cheeks to indicate this.</p>
<p>Her pale cheeks bloomed with color, making them look like ripe peaches.</p>
<p>However, on the other hand.</p>
<p>Unlike Alicia’s countenance, which had become as lively as a peach, Rosetta’s face started turning pale.</p>
<p>The cold, sinking look in her eyes was as deep as an immeasurable abyss.</p>
<p>If gossipers were by chance nearby, this kind of reaction was perfect for them to misunderstand.</p>
<p>As soon as her half-sister’s wound got healed, they would question how she could possibly make such a stiff expression…</p>
<p>And then they would say, ‘Ah, it’s only natural for the fake to get jealous of the real daughter.’</p>
<p>Rosetta also knew that this was what’s going to happen, so she bit the inside of her cheek.</p>
<p>Daniel was the only one here who could be under that kind of misunderstanding, but it was of no use to be misunderstood by even one person.</p>
<p>‘Let’s not act like a fool who can’t control her reactions.’</p>
<p>Rosetta closed her eyes for a moment and smoothed her brows.</p>
<p>When she let out a light exhale, her blood, which she felt had started getting cold, seemed to regain its original temperature.</p>
<p>Then, someone approached her.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Milady? Are you alright?”</p>
<p>The person who noticed was Cassion.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s previously closed eyes slowly opened once more. The low glance of those two golden eyes was directed towards him.</p>
<p>As the white veil was hung close to her face, her features could be seen through the thin cloth.</p>
<p>The corners of her lips tugged up into, then she shook her head.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Right, it’s not that she wasn’t alright.</p>
<p>She wasn’t hurt, she wasn’t sick.</p>
<p>It’s just— She despised the power that had emitted that white light.</p>
<p>To the extent that her blood would run cold just by seeing it.</p>
<p>The reason she detested divine power was, needless to say, due to Urien.</p>
<p>She had entered an entirely new world, but the sensation of divine power was similar everywhere she went. As soon as she saw the illumination of that white light, the afterimage of Urien struck her mind like a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>Divine power was used to save and heal people, but to Rosetta, it gave her nothing but a disgusting, repulsive sensation.</p>
<p>It was thanks to this power that Alicia’s wound was healed, but she couldn’t do anything to stop herself from feeling this way.</p>
<p>And it seemed like this was all the more the case because it’s the first time she’s seeing divine power in this world.</p>
<p>She schooled her features, but she couldn’t do anything about her pale complexion.</p>
<p>“Thank you for helping Alicia.”</p>
<p>Rosetta wrapped an arm around Alicia’s shoulders. Alicia still had those rosy cheeks as she fiddled with the back of her hand.</p>
<p>Alicia raised her head and glanced up at Rosetta.</p>
<p>Daniel’s eyes, too, turned towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>That smile on his face looked thoughtless.</p>
<p>“You helped me first, so I was only returning the favor.”</p>
<p>“Right. Then I believe this makes things even.”</p>
<p>In turn, Rosetta replied with a gentle smile.</p>
<p>Reading between the lines, this meant that they should have nothing to do with each other anymore since it’s been settled.</p>
<p>She was going to use this matter as a debt on House Freesia’s part, but the moment she witnessed the young duke’s divine power, she changed her mind.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t mesh well with the household known for their divine power.</p>
<p>Rather than forcing herself to meet people she was uncomfortable with, she thought that it would just be better to go their separate ways and never meet again, regardless of any debts.</p>
<p>“Why, that sounds a bit upsetting, but that’s probably just me, right?”</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled without a word and shrugged. She didn’t bother to answer him.</p>
<p>Then, she breathed in lightly and soon gave him a nod as a goodbye.</p>
<p>“We’ll be on our way now. My head hurts quite a bit, so we’ll have to leave.”</p>
<p>As Rosetta touched the side of her forehead, Alicia’s eyes widened like a rabbit’s.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Right! Sister, let’s go back so you can rest.”</p>
<p>In her surprise, Alicia seemed to be feeling apologetic because, for a moment, she forgot that her older sister wasn’t feeling well.</p>
<p>She urgently took Rosetta’s hand and stomped her feet, looking as if she was ready to rush away at any given moment.</p>
<p>Rosetta calmed Alicia for a moment with a gentle touch, then she looked at Daniel.</p>
<p>It was a meaningful look that said how they should part ways now.</p>
<p>“Goodness, I’ve been holding you up without knowing you’re sick. Ah, then perhaps I could also use my divine power to heal Your Ladyship…”</p>
<p>“No. It’s alright.”</p>
<p>Daniel just grinned awkwardly as he was cut off in the middle of his sentence.</p>
<p>He was about to step forward and come closer as well, but he was stopped there.</p>
<p>Even the way he touched the bridge of his nose exuded awkwardness.</p>
<p>“…I only need to return home and lie down. Thank you for your kindness, Young Duke, but I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Rosetta wanted to leave right now.</p>
<p>They had gone through the motions of courtesy and she was showing him that they were about to leave now, so he shouldn’t make a fuss and hold her back.</p>
<p>However, the man was far more tactless than she had thought.</p>
<p>Those curved blue eyes, as he awkwardly smiled, were glistening. Then, he asked.</p>
<p>“Did you cry?”</p>
<p>There was not even a single shred of prudence in that question.</p>
<p>Rosetta laughed.</p>
<p>She was so dumbfounded that she let out a laugh. And as her expression was left with only a smile now, she asked in return.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it rude to ask such a question to someone you’ve just met for the first time?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I apologize if it was rude. It’s just, your eyes are red.”</p>
<p>It was as if he meant no harm at all, and so an apology was promptly made.</p>
<p>Seeing Daniel flustered made it seem like he wasn’t lying.</p>
<p>Rosetta shrugged.</p>
<p>“It’s quite alright. However, it’s a bit difficult to answer because it’s embarrassing. Now, may we leave?”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes. Of course. Goodness me, I just… I keep showing only foolish sides of me.”</p>
<p>“Still, we received your help as well. Right, Alicia?”</p>
<p>“…Yes, that’s right. Thank you very much for your help, Young Duke.”</p>
<p>After Alicia conveyed her gratitude, Rosetta smiled lightly and soon turned around.</p>
<p>If she were to continue facing him, she had a hunch that he would catch her by surprise yet again.</p>
<p>In the end, however, Rosetta still could not leave.</p>
<p>The moment she turned around, she saw a group of men approaching them.</p>
<p>There were a total of three men crossing the distance.</p>
<p>Two of them were nobles who she hadn’t seen before, while the one standing in the middle was a familiar face.</p>
<p>Rosetta shifted Alicia and made her stand behind her.</p>
<p>Alicia was hidden only half a step behind her, but if Rosetta could hide her even just that much, she wanted to do it.</p>
<p>“Ah, so you were here, Princess Valentine.”</p>
<p>A deep voice greeted her languidly.</p>
<p>His vivid red eyes flashed.</p>
<p>His red hair, as it was under the sun’s illumination, was like a burning flame.</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled.</p>
<p>Beneath the veil of loose mesh fabric, bright red lips were drawn into a curve.</p>
<p>Ah, this. God damn it.</p>
<p>“It’s you, Young Duke Carter.”</p>
<p>Even as her mind was filled with curses, her gentle tone did not reveal this at all.</p>
<p>With their intentions hidden beneath, the gazes of those two people met in the air.</p>
<p>“Duke and Young Duke Valentine are still here. Perhaps, were you about to go back first?”</p>
<p>“They noticed that I wasn’t feeling very well, so Father and Brother told me to go back home first and rest.”</p>
<p>At this, Leo said, ‘Ah… Is that so.’</p>
<p>He spoke under his breath, though it sounded like a response.</p>
<p>“Indeed, you may have gotten a headache. You had shed so many tears, did you not?”</p>
<p>As he spoke, his eyes were fixed on Rosetta.</p>
<p>The two men standing at either side of Leo were obviously curious.</p>
<p>And apart from them, Daniel, who was behind, also seemed to be watching with interest.</p>
<p>“Yes, it was an embarrassing sight for me to have shown.”</p>
<p>“Embarrassing? But for the Young Lady to have shed many tears for someone you don’t know, all I thought is that you must be a very kind-hearted person.”</p>
<p>“I do admit that I’m rather soft-hearted. And I cry a lot, too.”</p>
<p>Ah, damn.</p>
<p>Rather than just words, the answer that flowed out of her lips was closer to breathing.</p>
<p>Soon, silence fell.</p>
<p>The two people stood facing each other without saying a word.</p>
<p>They were a sight to behold, like a painting, but as their eyes met, they constantly gauged each other.</p>
<p>‘…Why the hell.’</p>
<p>Rosetta asked herself inwardly. She couldn’t let her guards down for one second.</p>
<p>It was only natural for her to be vigilant around him, but why was Leo suddenly trying to see through her.</p>
<p>If he had bumped into them because of the hand of fate, then his attention should have been directed straight at Alicia.</p>
<p>He shouldn’t be staring at Rosetta unnecessarily.</p>
<p>Right. If this situation had been caused by some unwritten rule of the original novel.</p>
<p>But, no. Regardless of fate or whichever else, it’s as if she’s being pushed to appear before this man by some force.</p>
<p>If it’s like that, then what’s the point of trying to furtively figure out his motives?</p>
<p>She didn’t want to believe it, but perhaps—as long as it’s a crying woman, this man’s interest would be piqued?</p>
<p>Then certainly enough, Rosetta felt that she made the right choice in diverting that interest from Alicia.</p>
<p>Since Rosetta had rather wailed at that moment beside Alicia, the tears that little by little dripped down Alicia’s eyes went unnoticed back then.</p>
<p>Dimly, quite possibly.</p>
<p>Well, yes. Rosetta did think that his attention would be shifted to her.</p>
<p>And it didn’t matter.</p>
<p>This was a good thing.</p>
<p>Because her ultimate goal was for Alicia to not play the role of the female lead.</p>
<p>However, now that she was facing this very situation, all she could think was that this man was such a strange prick.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>‘Crazy bastard.’</p>
<p>“By any chance, is that all you need? If that’s the reason you’ve looked for me, then I would like to excuse myself now. As you mentioned earlier, my head hurts quite a bit.”</p>
<p>Rosetta spoke as though she was having a difficult time.</p>
<p>Leo’s gaze was fixed on Rosetta this whole while, but when the long silence between them was broken, he looked away.</p>
<p>Those red eyes turned one by one towards the people at Rosetta’s side.</p>
<p>Towards Alicia, who was slightly behind her. Then towards Cassion, who was standing there while staring back at Leo.</p>
<p>His red eyes lingered on Cassion.</p>
<p>On his hair, which was the shade of the blue night sky.</p>
<p>As though that gaze was calculating, as though that gaze was trying to pierce through the other man’s veil.</p>
<p>With only a thin piece of cloth between them, the two brothers stared closely at each other.</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>Yet again, Rosetta broke the silence.</p>
<p>The gaze that was on Cassion returned towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>“Ah, you’re feeling sick, and yet I’m keeping you here. Yes, that’s all. It’s just I felt bad seeing you cry earlier, so I wanted to ask if you’re doing alright.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for your concern. Then, with your permission, we’ll be on our way now. Again, my deepest condolences.”</p>
<p>Rosetta replied like so and curtsied towards him.</p>
<p>She had no idea just how many times she’d been forced to bow her head like this today.</p>
<p>Why was it so difficult to get out of this mansion.</p>
<p>As Rosetta grumbled inwardly, she took Alicia’s hand behind her.</p>
<p>Alicia was just hiding quietly, and this was exactly what Rosetta asked her to do before they entered the Carter residence.</p>
<p>Never engage Young Duke Carter in any conversation apart from offering her condolences.</p>
<p>Never make eye contact.</p>
<p>Alicia thought that they were strange requests at first, but when she saw the man’s burning red hair beneath the sunlight, she realized that her older sister’s advice was not for naught.</p>
<p>And so Alicia hurriedly lowered her head and stood by Rosetta. When her wrist was caught, it seemed to be the sign that they were finally leaving.</p>
<p>Leo’s gaze meandered along between the two sisters, but he stepped out of the way as though he had no intention of holding them back.</p>
<p>After she had given a light bow as a goodbye, Rosetta then led Alicia and Cassion away.</p>
<p>However, in the end, that pretense did not even last long.</p>
<p>Once again, the same voice held them back.</p>
<p>“From now on, why don’t you come and visit more often?”</p>
<p>Those words, Rosetta could attest, were the worst words she had ever heard.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 79</p>
<p>How difficult was it to get out of this mansion.</p>
<p>Clicking her tongue inwardly, Rosetta asked back with an innocent expression that seemed to make it look like she didn’t know what he’s saying.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s just that I feel so lonely after losing my brother. Perhaps to comfort us in this family and to strengthen the relationship between our three households, why don’t you come and visit often from now on?”</p>
<p>The stream of words flowed out smoothly and without any flaws.</p>
<p>Who would ever dare think that this man was the one who had killed his own brother.</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, wouldn’t our older brother be a better match?”</p>
<p>Rosetta pretended to be troubled for a moment, redirecting the arrow towards Damian.</p>
<p>Even if there was a reason to come here often, it’s not something she should do.</p>
<p>If he’s looking for someone who he’d see often, then it’s better for it to be Damien rather than either Rosetta or Alicia.</p>
<p>At the very least, Leo wouldn’t fall for Damian—unless the genre would change that drastically.</p>
<p>Still, if it’s love, that’s something that a person couldn’t control.</p>
<p>It’s just that, once Leo had fallen in love, he’s not the kind of person who’d be easy-going about it.</p>
<p>“We’re all the same age, aren’t we? We happen to have four people of the same age in our three households, so don’t you think that we’ll be good friends?”</p>
<p>Rosetta heard something snap inside her.</p>
<p>A thunderous sound echoed within her as she reflected on Leo’s words.</p>
<p>‘Four people of the same age in three households.’</p>
<p>The first was Leo, second was Rosetta and third was Alicia.</p>
<p>So, the other one was…</p>
<p>‘That guy?’</p>
<p>Daniel.</p>
<p>Daniel was still standing there, just watching Leo and Rosetta.</p>
<p>And evidently enough, the expression on his face was that of interest.</p>
<p>After just watching the entire time, he soon approached the two as though he had just thought of something.</p>
<p>As that man came closer, Rosetta felt her anxiety rising.</p>
<p>Now that he was close, Daniel patted Leo’s arm with that signature casual smile.</p>
<p>The red gaze of the other man was fixed on the elbow that was patted for a moment, then he looked at Daniel.</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s a good idea, Young Duke Carter. I agree, I agree.”</p>
<p>Daniel said this as he waved one hand.</p>
<p>His voice was so bright that it seemed as if his ability to read the room had been flung to the netherworld.</p>
<p>Rosetta blinked as she scratched the pad of one finger with the tip of a nail.</p>
<p>The situation had turned for the worse.</p>
<p>Leo Carter suggested it, and Daniel Freesia agreed.</p>
<p>Of the three families, two were in favor.</p>
<p>Besides that.</p>
<p>The two young lords who came here with Leo were looking this way very curiously.</p>
<p>Rosetta had received some intel about the nobles from Blanca.</p>
<p>She had to know as much as possible so that, whatever she had in her arsenal, she’d be able to use freely.</p>
<p>In particular, she studied the people who were usually around Leo. She learned their faces and their characteristics, and thanks to this, she could roughly guess who those two were.</p>
<p>Hermann and Walter.</p>
<p>Both had the characteristic of loose lips.</p>
<p>Even now, those two looked as if their lips were itching to talk.</p>
<p>Perhaps as soon as this encounter was over, those loose lips would be flapping about later today.</p>
<p>And it’s obvious that Leo wasn’t going to stop them from doing so.</p>
<p>‘I mean, why did he come to look for me with those two in tow in the first place?’</p>
<p>Suddenly, such doubts arose.</p>
<p>She realized that he must have been thinking of conducting this kind of situation from the beginning.</p>
<p>If this was a logical leap, then it was a leap. But for some reason, it truly seemed to be the case. If she were to consider how he acted in the original novel, then it suited his characterization.</p>
<p>In fact, even with just what happened with Daniel, it’s highly likely that they had been caught starting from there.</p>
<p>In a situation where witnesses were present, it had become difficult to refuse after Leo had suggested fostering a ‘cordial friendship’ with them.</p>
<p>Her red lips curled up.</p>
<p>It was a good smile, but inside her mouth, she was biting her tongue.</p>
<p>The ordeal she was facing now had set her mood into a terribly bad state.</p>
<p>The first scene had been narrowly evaded, but this—she couldn’t believe that everything was being set back like a butterfly effect.</p>
<p>Rosetta wrestled with her thoughts.</p>
<p>Frankly, if she could settle this in a way that she could take full responsibility, at this point, she would have already turned around and left without any regrets.</p>
<p>Regardless of the rumors, regardless of her reputation, regardless of any risks.</p>
<p>She didn’t give a damn about any of those.</p>
<p>Now, however, it’s become a family affair.</p>
<p>In this situation, Alicia and Damian were involved.</p>
<p>‘Rosetta.’</p>
<p>As she recalled Damian, she remembered his voice.</p>
<p>With a sense of guilt so ripe that it was easy to make use of him. That heavily remorseful voice.</p>
<p>“…What do you think, Alicia?”</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced back slightly and whispered to Alicia.</p>
<p>She blinked her wide gold eyes, slightly looking around her surroundings.</p>
<p>“May I have the honor of being your friend, Lady Alicia?”</p>
<p>And when her pink lips didn’t open easily, Daniel was the first to speak soothingly.</p>
<p>As Daniel made an exaggerated gesture of shaking hands, Alicia smiled faintly.</p>
<p>“…I would also like…”</p>
<p>But Alicia trailed off. Suddenly, she recalled what Rosetta said to her about Leo.</p>
<p>However, the brief utterance of a positive answer had already left through her lips.</p>
<p>As Alicia was trying to figure out what Rosetta wanted her to do, Rosetta patted her lightly on the shoulder.</p>
<p>“If Alicia thinks it’s fine, then I’m alright with it as well. Let’s exchange letters often¹. Like good friends.”</p>
<p>The last part of her response was said with deliberate emphasis.</p>
<p>Daniel might not know it, but Leo was the kind of person who was quick on the uptake. He could read between the lines.</p>
<p>Rosetta, Alicia, Daniel and Leo.</p>
<p>All four of them smiled.</p>
<p>Although the meaning of each smile did not have the same meaning.</p>
<p>“Wow, then we’re friends from now on, my friend.”</p>
<p>With a tone full of vigor, Daniel said this. His tactless palm hit Leo’s elbow yet again.</p>
<p>Leo smilingly moved out of the way.</p>
<p>It was a fluid motion, a movement that was clearly natural.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked at both men one at a time for a moment, then she opened her lips.</p>
<p>“Then, I really have to leave now. May I? Truly this time?”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s question, Leo’s brows grew furrowed as he nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course. I apologize once again for keeping you for too long when you’re not feeling well.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. It was discourteous of us.”</p>
<p>When Leo apologized, Daniel chimed in.</p>
<p>Rosetta shrugged, then she shook her head.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. It’s good that we’ve formed a connection. Then, see you again next time.”</p>
<p>“Shall I see you off?”</p>
<p>“No thank you, we’re alright. You have to stay here. Duke and Duchess Carter must be grieving a lot, and isn’t the funeral of your beloved older brother still ongoing?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your consideration.”</p>
<p>“Thank you in return for your kindness.”</p>
<p>After saying this, Rosetta quickly turned around.</p>
<p>Yet another thing might come up to hold her back.</p>
<p>Of course, thus far, it didn’t seem like they wouldn’t keep her here just because she had already turned around.</p>
<p>But she just wanted to leave quickly because she was afraid that even Daniel would insist that he should come out to see them off.</p>
<p>Fortunately, this time, there was no voice to stop them in place again.</p>
<p>‘Let’s just go home and rest.’</p>
<p>Right now, her head really was throbbing.</p>
<p>It hurt so much that it felt as if a migraine would arrest her entire body.</p>
<p>All she was thinking now was that they should go home and rest so that she could think about how to deal with this goddamn situation.</p>
<p>How many steps had they taken?</p>
<p>Carrying a bit of humidity with it, a summer breeze swept past.</p>
<p>The light wind brushed against her hair and her cheeks, then it disappeared.</p>
<p>Leaves could be heard rustling against each other. It was the sound of nature that was brought upon by the breeze.</p>
<p>Soon, all the noises stopped.</p>
<p>What’s left behind was silence.</p>
<p>And so, the sound that could be heard coming from the entrance of the thicket was heard only belatedly.</p>
<p>Rustle.</p>
<p>It was out of place, this sound that seemed to come from an animal.</p>
<p>It was fast, it was light.</p>
<p>Something that was definitely not human.</p>
<p>Inevitably, Rosetta’s gaze turned towards where that sound was coming from.</p>
<p>Halt.</p>
<p>Once more, her strides were stopped.</p>
<p>This time, no one was holding her back. Rosetta stopped of her own accord as she stared blankly into the thicket.</p>
<p>Her gold eyes were filled entirely with the sight of those well-trimmed trees and bushes.</p>
<p>Following Rosetta, Cassion and Alicia also stopped.</p>
<p>The two wordlessly waited for Rosetta to start walking again.</p>
<p>After a few seconds, however, it seemed as if Rosetta was unwilling to move.</p>
<p>With her back against the other two, she was just standing there like a statue, staring at the thicket.</p>
<p>“…Sister?”</p>
<p>“Milady²?”</p>
<p>Feeling that something was amiss, Alicia and Cassion called out to her.</p>
<p>But she did not answer.</p>
<p>Where was it, her answer.</p>
<p>She didn’t make even a small acknowledgement.</p>
<p>The strange reaction urged Cassion to move.</p>
<p>Stepping closer to Rosetta, he now also looked at the thicket where her gaze was fixed.</p>
<p>However, there was nothing there.</p>
<p>There was a rustling sound earlier, but that was all.</p>
<p>It was just an area of well-trimmed trees and bushes.</p>
<p>Nothing more and nothing less.</p>
<p>Knitting his brows, Cassion tried to look through the thicket more, but he soon concluded that nothing’s there. Then, he turned to face Rosetta.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“…Rosetta…?”</p>
<p>He unconsciously called Rosetta’s name.</p>
<p>They were outside and in a public place, so he was required to call her ‘Milady’, but he couldn’t.</p>
<p>Because her face had turned so pale that it seemed as if she was going to turn into a corpse at any given moment.</p>
<p>Her golden eyes reflected the thicket, and as they were deeply sunken, her gaze was empty.</p>
<p>It was as if she had been surprised. But, no. It looked as if she had witnessed such a shocking scene that she’d lost her senses.</p>
<p>“…Rose… Milady. Milady.”</p>
<p>Cassion held her arm and waved a few times in front of her.</p>
<p>Then, Rosetta’s empty gaze turned slowly—ever so slowly—towards Cassion.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? What made you react this way?”</p>
<p>Cassion’s voice pressed down hard as he asked.</p>
<p>It was in a small voice that only the two of them could hear.</p>
<p>Feeling the strange atmosphere, Alicia shifted her weight on one foot then the other.</p>
<p>Blankly, Rosetta shook off Cassion’s hand.</p>
<p>Then, she covered her eyes with her own pale hands.</p>
<p>“Why are you…”</p>
<p>“One second.”</p>
<p>Rosetta firmly cut off the words of concern that he was about to say again.</p>
<p>She hadn’t stumbled, but it looked as though she was about to stumble over any time.</p>
<p>Beneath the hands that covered her eyes, her red lips smiled helplessly.</p>
<p>Rather than an act to show that she was at ease, the stiff smile seemed more to be out of disbelief—out of anger and incredulity.</p>
<p>She laughed.</p>
<p>With her face buried in the dark.</p>
<p>Trying to gauge whether what she saw just now was a mere hallucination or the truth, she laughed.</p>
<p>Immediately after that rustling sound, a strange creature appeared in her sight for but a moment.</p>
<p>She didn’t see it properly and it disappeared in an instant, but the unusual appearance of that thing left a deep impression on her. Even if it was just a moment.</p>
<p>A bluish body that was much too pale. The whites of its eyes that had instead turned entirely black.</p>
<p>Like an animal and like a human being, but unlike an animal nor a human.</p>
<p>A blue monster.</p>
<p>That thing. It was the kind of demonic beast that Urien controlled.</p>
<p>1. it doesn’t translate well, but what Rosetta did here was a play on Leo’s words. Leo proposed that she should ‘come and go often’, meaning to ‘visit’, but Rosetta twisted those words and replied to him with ‘alright, let our letters come and go often.’</p>
<p>2. from now on, i’ll be using the titles of ‘Ducal Lady’, ‘Lady’ or ‘esteemed daughter’ for both Rosetta and Alicia instead of ‘Princess’ or ‘Ducal Princess’.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 80</p>
<p>No way, really, truly.</p>
<p>It’s impossible to believe this.</p>
<p>She must have seen it wrong.</p>
<p>Right. That’s the only way to comprehend this.</p>
<p>It appeared within only a split second. Rosetta just caught sight of it from her periphery.</p>
<p>She’s certain that she must have just imagined it.</p>
<p>That goddamn divine power made her think of Urien, and that’s probably why she was subconsciously reminded of even the monsters that Urien controlled.</p>
<p>In the first place, how could the monsters that Urien controlled be here.</p>
<p>‘Common sense. It shouldn’t be here.’</p>
<p>With her hands still over her eyes, Rosetta repeatedly tried to calm her racing heartbeat.</p>
<p>She had only been mistaken. She’s sure of it.</p>
<p>However, these attempts didn’t have much effect.</p>
<p>Even throughout this fruitless rumination, her cold body temperature didn’t abate easily. Then, she hurriedly turned around because she felt something ominous behind her.</p>
<p>“…Hoh…”</p>
<p>All of a sudden, light poured into her sight, which had been covered by darkness just now.</p>
<p>She waited for her vision to adjust to the sudden light, then she opened them slowly once more.</p>
<p>Still, she could feel goosebumps over her skin as the same creepy feeling was on her back.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure of it… That gaze… I felt it.’</p>
<p>Her golden eyes flashed and looked around in a flurry.</p>
<p>It definitely felt like that eerie gaze, but then all she could see some distance away were the men from earlier.</p>
<p>Leo, Daniel. The two other men.</p>
<p>They were talking, but looking this way.</p>
<p>No matter how you look at it, it just looked like they were watching them leave by seeing them off from a distance.</p>
<p>There were no suspicious glances, nor were there any strange atmospheres.</p>
<p>And that creepy feeling was not there as well.</p>
<p>‘Seriously, did I suddenly go crazy.’</p>
<p>Too much happened in just a short period of time.</p>
<p>No one else noticed. She was the only one who did. But.</p>
<p>As Rosetta stared blankly into the air once more, Cassion had been there to hold her arm.</p>
<p>With her gold eyes gaining recognition once more, her gaze turned directly towards the man.</p>
<p>At the uncharacteristically frantic gaze, Cassion held his tongue.</p>
<p>He was worried about her sudden change in behavior, almost to the extent that he regretted coming here, regardless of the funeral or whichever else.</p>
<p>“Rosetta, let’s go,” he whispered.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared back at Cassion without an answer.</p>
<p>It looked as if she was looking for someone, and so Cassion removed the veil over his face.</p>
<p>Just in case Rosetta was looking for him.</p>
<p>As the flimsy piece of cloth was lifted upon his face, the summer air came into contact with his skin.</p>
<p>Two gazes met head-on.</p>
<p>Lightly rubbing her wrist as she stayed silent, Cassion opened his lips once more.</p>
<p>With a faint, mysterious smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Your hands are cold.”</p>
<p>Only then did Rosetta nod slowly.</p>
<p>Then, her halted steps were slowly set into motion again.</p>
<p>Her bewildered gaze was no more, and instead, a look of propriety and clarity returned.</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s go.”</p>
<p>However, unlike the eyes that found clarity anew, her strides seemed to have slowed, and her pale face remained as white as a sheet, as though she had gotten sick.</p>
<p>“I must have… just imagined it.”</p>
<p>Even when no one asked, these words were mumbled as though to imply.</p>
<p>Right now.</p>
<p>She was closer to Rita than Rosetta.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The man’s eyes were fixed on the woman.</p>
<p>Silver hair that fluttered with every step she took.</p>
<p>Halting in place and blankly staring at something at the side.</p>
<p>When the man next to her approached, she covered her eyes with both hands.</p>
<p>Soon, she looked back towards this direction, on edge. Then she turned around, and her back looked weak.</p>
<p>The Rosetta reflected in the man’s eyes grew farther and farther away.</p>
<p>The man captured her in his gaze without ever blinking. Until, soon, what he was looking at had already disappeared.</p>
<p>As he did not blink for a long time, his eyes had reddened.</p>
<p>Instead of shedding tears, the man laughed.</p>
<p>Finally, he found the woman he’s been looking for.</p>
<p>Yes. At last, I found you.</p>
<p>My Rita.</p>
<p>My…</p>
<p>‘Rosetta.’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘Rosetta.’</p>
<p>In my dreams, I heard a hazy voice echoing through my mind.</p>
<p>As if to act upon the words that he said like a habit, that he would never leave her side, Urien appeared in my dreams to the point that I’d become so sick and tired of it.</p>
<p>With him as their shepherd, even the blue monsters he controlled appeared.</p>
<p>After returning from the funeral, I lay sick in bed for a few days.</p>
<p>Violent nightmares wreaked chaos upon my mind and, as if it was a direct reaction to this, my body began to be riddled with pain as well.</p>
<p>A scorching fever, an inability to keep the food I’ve eaten down, a palpitating heart, immense waves of pain.</p>
<p>It was a tumultuous sickness caused by exhaustion.</p>
<p>Alicia came every day and cried every single time. Damian came here once.</p>
<p>Diana said that the duke also stopped by once…</p>
<p>He came by while I was sleeping, so I didn’t see his face. How fortunate.</p>
<p>I suddenly recalled the doctor’s face as he gave me a check-up.</p>
<p>Then, during one late evening, I recalled Cassion’s face as he was staring down at me.</p>
<p>His lips, closed in a straight line, didn’t say anything. He just watched me for a moment and left the room.</p>
<p>While I was sick, I lay bedridden, flitting back and forth between the realms of dream and reality—waking up and passing out every now and again. Throughout all this, I recalled what happened the day before.</p>
<p>To determine whether what I saw that day was true or false.</p>
<p>But at the end, each conclusion I made was always the same.</p>
<p>‘I must have seen it wrong.’</p>
<p>Why would there be a blue monster at that place.</p>
<p>No, how couldn’t it possibly have been there.</p>
<p>From the very beginning, I was in a different world, separate from the one where that thing existed.</p>
<p>It’s only right for everything related to Urien to remain in the third transmigration. The only thing of him that could have traversed worlds was my remembrance of him.</p>
<p>Then, if it hadn’t been a blue monster, what was that thing?</p>
<p>Just like how I surmised that day, perhaps Urien flashed through my mind because I witnessed Daniel’s divine power, and when I thought of Urien, an apparition of the monster escaped my subconscious.</p>
<p>Besides that, there’s also proof that she had just imagined the monster that day.</p>
<p>Wasn’t I the only one who saw something strange at the time of the incident?</p>
<p>If the monster truly was there, then what of Alicia, Leo, Daniel, the two other noblemen and Cassion?</p>
<p>At least one of them should have seen the monster.</p>
<p>Just like how I did it every single day back then, my worries and doubts eventually came down to the same conclusion—that they were just ‘illusory’. Even before I could think about it deeper, these thoughts would be brushed aside as mere ‘delusions’.</p>
<p>My severe body aches came to an end.</p>
<p>As though my mind had regained control over my body.</p>
<p>Laughably enough.</p>
<p>However, I found out that something else more ridiculous happened.</p>
<p>As soon as I regained my strength, Diana carefully told me about it.</p>
<p>‘Sir Maxwell has been ill since yesterday. Coincidentally, it happened at the same time you came to, Milady.’</p>
<p>Hearing Diana’s words, I laughed.</p>
<p>It’s just as she said—what a coincidence.</p>
<p>Didn’t it look like my sickness had been transferred to him?</p>
<p>I ate lunch at midday.</p>
<p>Even after my meal, I laughed.</p>
<p>I drank tea with Alicia, who wasn’t crying anymore for the first time in a long while—and I laughed again.</p>
<p>We had an early dinner together soon after teatime, and when the meal ended, the smile left my lips as I stepped out of the room.</p>
<p>I had an objective now, and that’s to pay the sick Cassion a visit.</p>
<p>As I reached his door, I knocked, yet I couldn’t hear an answer in return.</p>
<p>In any case, I only knocked for the sake of formalities, so I opened the door without any hesitation.</p>
<p>‘…It’s dark.’</p>
<p>It’s true that it’s already evening, but the room was still too dark.</p>
<p>Thick curtains were covering the window so that the patient could sleep soundly.</p>
<p>The only source of light in that room was a flickering candle.</p>
<p>Looking around the dim room, a slight smile tugged upon my lips because I recalled the past.</p>
<p>Why of course, it was the day after I went to Katie’s prison cell, and Cassion awkwardly comforted me.</p>
<p>I walked closer to Cassion, who was asleep.</p>
<p>Diana, who had followed behind me, closed the door silently. Then, she stood right in front of the room, her legs stuck near the surface.</p>
<p>Looking at Diana once, I soon glanced at the sleeping Cassion.</p>
<p>Eyes, lips, closed like straight lines.</p>
<p>Still, this man had the visage of tranquility as he slept.</p>
<p>I reached out slowly and touched his forehead with my hand.</p>
<p>The round curve of his smooth forehead wound gently beneath the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>In the shadows, his dark hair tickled the back of my hand.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps a bit warm?’</p>
<p>No, wasn’t it a little hot?</p>
<p>At the indeterminable temperature, I removed my hand. When I checked the temperature of my own forehead, it seemed like Cassion’s was slightly hotter.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it soon time for Logan to give him a check-up?”</p>
<p>“Yes, he’ll be here soon.”</p>
<p>As soon as Diana said that, noise could be heard from the other side of the door.</p>
<p>Unsteady footsteps from the end of the hallway came closer and closer, then halted in front of the door.</p>
<p>Then, there was a courteous knock.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Diana answered on my behalf as she opened the door. She seemed to have guessed who that person was.</p>
<p>As long as I was beside Cassion, if it was any other servant, Diana would have sent them back.</p>
<p>But beyond the opened door, as expected, it was Logan.</p>
<p>His round eyes could be seen widening as he looked at Diana, but he soon nodded slightly towards the both of us. He entered the room.</p>
<p>“It’s been a while, Logan.”</p>
<p>“I saw you often, though you probably didn’t notice I was there because your eyes had been closed, Milady.”</p>
<p>“You paid me a sick visit?”</p>
<p>“The Madam was worried, you see.”</p>
<p>“Ah, so you were there as surveillance. By any chance, is she worried that she might not get paid if the person who signed a contract with her dies?”</p>
<p>I chuckled quietly as I said this, but instead of answering right away, Logan adjusted his glasses, up and down with one finger.</p>
<p>Soon, he opened his lips and a sigh came out.</p>
<p>“I’ve said this many times, however you and my master really do resemble each other.”</p>
<p>“And I’ve said this many times, but I simply cannot agree with that statement.”</p>
<p>As I answered, I imitated him and pretended to adjust a nonexistent pair of glasses over my eyes.</p>
<p>Logan closed his eyes, looking as if he’s tired of this. But he opened his eyes eventually and approached Cassion’s side.</p>
<p>“So then, how did Maxwell end up like this?”</p>
<p>No more jokes this time. I asked him a genuine question now.</p>
<p>How on earth did this guy end up getting bedridden.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like he was wracked with cold sweat, he wasn’t tossing and turning, and the vaguely warm temperature of his forehead didn’t even seem like his condition was serious…</p>
<p>“It’s simply an accumulation of fatigue. He was training intensely over the course of a short period of time until now, so of course.”</p>
<p>“…Aha.”</p>
<p>Hearing Logan’s explanation, I let out a shallow sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Leaning slightly down towards Cassion, I raised one empty hand. To be exact, I was feeling the pulse of his wrist.</p>
<p>And it was just as Logan said. It seemed to be a case of overexertion.</p>
<p>He didn’t sustain any internal injuries, and the flow of his energy was stable.</p>
<p>In fact, as soon as I entered this room, I could have just checked his pulse.</p>
<p>But I didn’t.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until I heard Logan say that it’s not something serious that I did it.</p>
<p>Why was that?</p>
<p>The question arose belatedly, but it calmly subsided.</p>
<p>Again, only a short sigh of relief slipped through.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 81</p>
<p>“If all that work caught up to you, of course you’d get fatigued.”</p>
<p>After setting down Cassion’s wrist, I leaned against the windowsill.</p>
<p>Now that I think about it, when one’s fatigue were to accumulate, their body’s condition wouldn’t be the same.</p>
<p>This man was so far removed from rigorous swordsmanship training before, but he endured it and even bested a knight in a match.</p>
<p>After swordsmanship training, he didn’t lag behind with his magic training either.</p>
<p>I told him that he shouldn’t sleep less at night, but I’m not sure if he heeded my advice.</p>
<p>When setting a goal and striving to achieve it, the moment that the goal could be seen on the horizon, people tended to act foolishly.</p>
<p>Besides that, the amount of mana he could control increased and he also recently saw his family, who’d been trying to kill him all this time, so he was only bound to be fatigued.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s laudable enough that he collapsed only now.</p>
<p>Staring at his closed eyelids quietly, I opened my lips.</p>
<p>“He even has a fever now, will he be okay?”</p>
<p>“Your Ladyship also fell ill just a couple days ago.”</p>
<p>Logan’s firm answer was understandable.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“Do you think he and I are the same? Our Maxwell is weak¹, you know.”</p>
<p>I meant it sincerely, but as they listened to my words, Diana and Logan’s expressions changed spectacularly.</p>
<p>As though they had rehearsed it, they looked at me at the same time. Then, as they glanced down at Cassion, they nodded together.</p>
<p>“Indeed…”</p>
<p>“He is still unskilled in many ways.”</p>
<p>Diana and Logan spoke one after another.</p>
<p>I murmured only to myself, but the way Cassion’s circumstances elicited pity made me chuckle.</p>
<p>“Anyway, there’s nothing to worry about. As long as he takes a few days off and drinks his medicine, he’ll recover quickly.”</p>
<p>“Alright then.”</p>
<p>As Cassion remained asleep all the while, Logan examined him. Those closed eyes did not open.</p>
<p>Logan jotted down a few notes on a notebook that he brought, then with a snap, he closed it.</p>
<p>Looking tired as he pressed a hand over his eyes, Logan turned to me.</p>
<p>“And about the ‘elixir’ you told me about the other day.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right. How did that go?”</p>
<p>Back then, a few days after Diana’s revenge—</p>
<p>I wrote down what I could still remember about the elixir’s recipe and gave it to Logan.</p>
<p>I had to choose ingredients that existed in this world—there were only a few kinds.</p>
<p>But even procuring those few things wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>Most of the ingredients and preparation methods would be unfamiliar to Logan, and even if they were common in this world, the efficacy would be slightly different.</p>
<p>Besides, the person who originally made this elixir was a person who was half-transcendent and half-human.</p>
<p>Starting with the vessel of the individual who would be making it, the difference was stark, so it would be difficult to make exactly the same medicine.</p>
<p>In the end, our conclusion from this endeavor would be to study a new method of formulating.</p>
<p>The ingredients had been tweaked a little, and the formulation method was slightly different as well.</p>
<p>There’s no guarantee that this would end up successful, but likewise, there’s no guarantee that we would fail. It’s worth a try.</p>
<p>“Are you making any progress?”</p>
<p>I asked again, urging but without any pressure.</p>
<p>Logan nodded with an expression that wasn’t all too confident, but also not too bad.</p>
<p>“First, I have successfully studied some of the mixing methods that you’ve given me. As for the other things, progress is still ongoing.”</p>
<p>“Oh.”</p>
<p>It was only a fraction of the work, but I was a little impressed to know that he’d succeeded in that regard because even that wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>Without revealing a reaction, Logan continued explaining.</p>
<p>“I was worried because it’s mostly a formulation of Eastern medicinal herbs, oddly enough, but when I tested it, there were no side effects and its efficacy was good.”</p>
<p>“…Test? How exactly did you test it?”</p>
<p>A dangerous scenario fluttered in my mind.</p>
<p>That is, Leo’s misdeed against Diana’s younger sister in the original novel.</p>
<p>Logan might have caught on to what I was insinuating. He just looked back at me with disbelief in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I myself am the test subject.”</p>
<p>“You did it yourself?”</p>
<p>He surprised me in a different way.</p>
<p>“What if you fall ill because you did that?”</p>
<p>The man fell silent.</p>
<p>He gazed into the air as though to gauge something. Then, he slowly opened his lips.</p>
<p>“I’m somewhat resistant to poison. You don’t have to worry about that happening.”</p>
<p>“…Aha. That reminds me, you did say that your specialty is poison.”</p>
<p>There’s no way that someone handling poison wasn’t marginally tolerant to it.</p>
<p>I had a fleeting thought that his body was in the perfect condition to handle medicine and potions.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sleeping Cassion caught my eye.</p>
<p>‘Come to think of it, Cassion needs to develop some resistance to poison.’</p>
<p>I should ask Logan to make a potion that could develop Cassion’s poison resistance next time.</p>
<p>While I was distracted by these random thoughts, Logan continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Anyway, the progress right now isn’t bad in many ways, however the medicine you most desire couldn’t be formulated to the best of its potential because of the lacking ingredients.”</p>
<p>“If it’s the most desired, then you mean a rapid development potion?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a rapid development potion.”</p>
<p>Exactly as it’s called, it was a medicine to accelerate one’s growth.</p>
<p>Drinking this medicine would improve one’s internal strength and would make one’s qi flow smoothly. At the same time, it would also purify one’s blood and help the body recover.</p>
<p>It was a necessary medicine for Cassion, as he needed to grow in a short period of time.</p>
<p>That’s why I really want the rapid development potion to be made successfully…</p>
<p>“You said that there’s not enough ingredients. If you do have the ingredients, will there be any other problem?”</p>
<p>“There won’t. I succeeded in making a potion that’s of a similar kind to the recipe you had given me. However, I ran out of the ingredients I needed the most while I was studying it.”</p>
<p>“Can’t you ask Blanca to procure more? There’s nothing she can’t get her hands on.”</p>
<p>At my declaration of my firm belief in Blanca, Logan’s brows rose.</p>
<p>“She can procure it. But it would be difficult to find those ingredients within the Empire, so she would have to import it from abroad. It will take a while.”</p>
<p>“How long…”</p>
<p>“Perhaps, about two years?”</p>
<p>Hoh.</p>
<p>I’m at a loss for words. If it’ll get here in two years, then that’s too late.</p>
<p>Cassion’s resurrection was due on the coming-of-age ball next January.</p>
<p>“That’s too late already. Is there really no way to get those ingredients within the Empire?”</p>
<p>Well, it’s clear that it’s unobtainable when Blanca had yet to start discussing the price.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I couldn’t help but think it’s a shame.</p>
<p>“At this moment, the ingredient doesn’t exist in the Empire. It’s been extinct for more than two decades now.”</p>
<p>“Extinct? Which ingredient?”</p>
<p>“The antlers of a white deer.”</p>
<p>So it’s that, the antlers of a white deer.</p>
<p>In the case of the rapid development potion, Logan had to research and modify the ingredients and formulation for this elixir.</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar item, so those white deer antlers must be one of the improvised ingredients.</p>
<p>‘Even just hearing about it makes it seem unfamiliar.’</p>
<p>As I nodded, I tried to brush off my disappointment.</p>
<p>It was a shame, but we have to let go of what we couldn’t do.</p>
<p>It’s not a habit of mine to waste time on things that wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>In my mind, I saw a deer with a white body and yellow antlers, but with a meaningless shake of the head, the image gradually faded.</p>
<p>Along with the deer’s silhouette.</p>
<p>All of a sudden, I was filled with a strange feeling as I associated the words ‘white deer’ with the white-furred and yellow-horned animal.</p>
<p>“Wait, did you say white deer?”</p>
<p>“Yes. A white deer.”</p>
<p>“Then… the deer’s body is white, and the antlers are yellow?”</p>
<p>As I mumbled, Logan nodded as he looked at me with questions in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>Leaning against the window frame, I tapped a curtain with my fingertips. Tok. The thick curtain made a dull sound.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes for a moment and thought about the original novel.</p>
<p>And I wondered, where exactly I saw this deer that I had a strange feeling of déjà vu.</p>
<p>My rumination didn’t last long.</p>
<p>Soon enough, I realized where I saw it.</p>
<p>That was quite the massive episode. Funny how I didn’t think about it right away.</p>
<p>With a grin now on my lips, I opened my eyes. Still, the green-gray eyes looked at me dubiously.</p>
<p>“I’ll get it for you, that ingredient.”</p>
<p>Hearing my confident declaration, the questions in his eyes grew even more.</p>
<p>“You’re going to procure it? How?”</p>
<p>“How, well. Instead of that, I can tell you that the time I’ll need to get it will be about… two months?”</p>
<p>“That’s better than two years.”</p>
<p>“Certainly.”</p>
<p>It seemed like he wanted to ask further, but instead, he nodded.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll trust you and wait for it.”</p>
<p>I could roughly guess his unsaid question.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be procured by Blanca, who he was loyal to, so how could I get it in just two months?</p>
<p>However, I didn’t have to answer a question that I wasn’t asked, so I just hummed.</p>
<p>“Of course, Doctor.”</p>
<p>Logan rose from his seat.</p>
<p>It’s an implicit gesture to say that their business here was over.</p>
<p>As I was still leaning against the windowsill, I watched Logan as he was ready to go out. However, I opened my lips once more because something occurred to me belatedly.</p>
<p>“By the way, what do you think about him?”</p>
<p>“Who are you referring to?”</p>
<p>“You know already but you’re feigning innocence. I’m talking about your student.”</p>
<p>At the mention of that student, Logan scratched his forehead. While putting his notebook into his coat pocket, he responded.</p>
<p>“I don’t recall having a student or anything like that.”</p>
<p>His voice was once again firm.</p>
<p>Diana had been listening quietly until now, but with a pout, Diana interjected.</p>
<p>“Zobel will be very disheartened if he heard you say that. He treats you like a teacher, you know.”</p>
<p>Logan stared back at Diana without answering. He just shoved his pen in his pocket.</p>
<p>I laughed a little as I watched Logan act that way.</p>
<p>His voice was entirely firm and his attitude was absolutely negative, but his expression didn’t look all that bad.</p>
<p>“Yeah, be nice to Zobel. He’s someone I especially entrusted to you. If you teach him well, he’ll be a decent pharmacist.”</p>
<p>My words were to pacify him, but Logan’s straight brows knitted slightly.</p>
<p>It seemed like he noticed that I was teasing him.</p>
<p>Anyway, just like Blanca, he’s quite quick-witted.</p>
<p>His green-gray eyes were sullen now, and with an equally sullen voice, he answered.</p>
<p>“Well… Even with his skills now, he’s not bad as a pharmacist. To the point that you wouldn’t believe he’s actually a knight.”</p>
<p>1. When Rosetta said Cassion is weak, it was more like in the ‘fragile’, ‘delicate’ or ‘frail’ way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 82</p>
<p>Zobel.</p>
<p>He’s the pharmacist I attached to Logan.</p>
<p>To be more exact, he’s a hatchling chick pharmacist who I entrusted Logan to raise.</p>
<p>That’s why Logan gave a negative response as though he loathed the idea.</p>
<p>Logan acted as though it’s annoying to take charge of another person, but when he checked Zobel’s skills, he soon realized that they weren’t all that bad, and so Logan became willing to take Zobel under his wing as his student.</p>
<p>Zobel helped out David with his deceitful stints all this time, however it wasn’t long after David had been taken away that Zobel went to my side.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This was a few days after the match between Cassion and David—</p>
<p>Zobel himself asked if I could meet him in person.</p>
<p>Although Diana had already told me the whole story of David’s ‘defecation incident,’ Zobel came forward to convey his apology and express his gratitude directly.</p>
<p>Still with an ashen complexion, he bowed very low towards me.</p>
<p>“I deeply apologize that I acted the way that I did. And for absolving me of my c-crimes, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>I stared at him aloofly and spoke quietly.</p>
<p>“Fine. I accept both your gratitude and your apology.”</p>
<p>The tone of my voice wasn’t all that kind, but Zobel smiled as though he was greatly comforted. All that happened was that he apologized, and I received his apology.</p>
<p>After this, we had nothing else to talk about.</p>
<p>In the midst of a secret transaction, what more was the point of facing each other again?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as I sat in front of him, Zobel continued to stand still in that spot, and it seemed as if he didn’t want to leave.</p>
<p>As he fidgeted with his fingers, it looked like he had something more to say.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>Cutting the prolonged silence short, I was the first to speak.</p>
<p>I’m here now, face-to-face with him, so he should just say what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>Zobel’s shoulders flinched in surprise, however he soon opened his lips in a stutter.</p>
<p>“I, I’m going to quit being a knight, Milady.”</p>
<p>He hardly spoke more than a few words, but after this statement alone, he looked a little relieved.</p>
<p>And whether or not he gained courage from that first statement, he continued his confessions, which I frankly wasn’t very curious about in the first place.</p>
<p>“I only did those things because David was threatening me, but everything I’ve done until now still weighs heavily on my conscience.”</p>
<p>“So?”</p>
<p>“…S…So, because I’ve done something shameful enough to disparage my honor as a knight, I’ve decided to stop being one.”</p>
<p>He dreamed of such a position that didn’t suit him from the very beginning, so he’s not that far off from the mark.</p>
<p>Then, the man added bitterly as a murmur.</p>
<p>It’s bittersweet, but it’s not a lie.</p>
<p>In any case, he had many realizations as he saw David being dragged away.</p>
<p>To be honest, I could understand Zobel’s position as he was thinking something along the lines of, ‘Should I blame myself for everything that I did, regardless of whether I was being threatened or not?’ Everyone had different notions, and I could respect Zobel’s stance.</p>
<p>“Then what will you do from now on?”</p>
<p>As if he didn’t expect for me to reply, the man’s carrot-colored eyes grew wide.</p>
<p>He scratched one freckled cheek and stuttered out a response.</p>
<p>“I’m going to be… a pharmacist.”</p>
<p>“A pharmacist?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Milady. My father is a pharmacist, you see, and I’d like to follow in his footsteps to help.”</p>
<p>Pharmacist, he said.</p>
<p>“It suits you.”</p>
<p>It was quite literally the occupation that suited him perfectly.</p>
<p>After all, every single potion and medicine that helped David thus far was made by Zobel himself.</p>
<p>If David had bought those potions himself, he might have gotten noticed, that’s why he left the task of formulating to Zobel.</p>
<p>Originally, it was considered dangerous for any civilian to formulate medicines, but the background check I had on him stated that, ever since his days at the academy, he had a great talent in medicine manufacturing…</p>
<p>It wouldn’t hurt for him to pursue pharmacy.</p>
<p>Then again, this reminded me of something.</p>
<p>‘I also need a pharmacist to make a cure for Ria.’</p>
<p>The cure for Diana’s younger sister definitely exists.</p>
<p>In the original novel, Leo’s researcher had succeeded in making it, so this meant that it’s entirely possible to recreate it.</p>
<p>In fact, I knew what the main ingredient was.</p>
<p>The only problem was that I didn’t know how exactly to make it.</p>
<p>Unless I knew the manufacturing process, I’d need to find a professional pharmacist to work on creating it.</p>
<p>‘If it’s Logan…’</p>
<p>No, it can’t be him.</p>
<p>Logan was a specialist in both poison and medicine.</p>
<p>However, some problems would arise if he was the one I’d ask.</p>
<p>He was Blanca’s subordinate, not mine.</p>
<p>That was the problem.</p>
<p>I couldn’t easily leave a matter like this to someone who wasn’t even my own person, especially if it was an endeavor that could take years to complete.</p>
<p>‘To begin with, the contract I have with Blanca is just two years…’</p>
<p>Through and through, Logan would move just for the sake of Blanca.</p>
<p>He was only willing to listen to me now because I had signed a contract with Blanca.</p>
<p>After two years, he would leave without ever looking back, and so this matter was something I couldn’t possibly leave in his hands.</p>
<p>‘As expected, the best method is to find the pharmacist who made the medicine in the original.’</p>
<p>Rather, it was the fastest method to look for that pharmacist rather than to go about this in the roundabout manner.</p>
<p>If I want complete certainty when it comes to the medicine’s creation, wouldn’t the chances of success be more significant with the original pharmacist rather than any other average person?</p>
<p>Allegedly, the pharmacist who made the cure in the original novel was a man in his mid-twenties, and he had brown hair and orange eyes…</p>
<p>Thinking to myself, my eyes gravitated to the person in front of me.</p>
<p>This man was standing quietly there, staring back at me while I was lost in thought.</p>
<p>Brown hair. Orange eyes. They both caught my attention.</p>
<p>‘No way…’</p>
<p>I blinked in a daze. Then soon, a smirk found its way to my lips.</p>
<p>‘Ey, no way.’</p>
<p>This is absolutely ridiculous.</p>
<p>In this world, what kind of coincidence exactly was this.</p>
<p>However, unlike the incredulity I felt that was revealed on my expression, inwardly, doubt still constantly nagged at me.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, I started to compare Zobel to the original pharmacist.</p>
<p>‘The original novel’s pharmacist… That character remained unnamed, but he was characterized with a stutter. And he looked very emaciated due to the dark circles around his eyes…’</p>
<p>Based on these clues, the descriptions matched one after another.</p>
<p>Still, what turned my doubts into conviction weren’t these physical descriptions, but the biggest difference between the pharmacist in the original story and the current Zobel.</p>
<p>That is,</p>
<p>‘The pharmacist in the novel despised the Valentines.’</p>
<p>I raised one hand to cover my lips.</p>
<p>This was to hide the cheers that would have come out, along with the astonishment that I was feeling.</p>
<p>If the pharmacist in the novel and Zobel were the same person, then it all made sense.</p>
<p>Since Cassion and David wouldn’t have had a match in the original storyline, Zobel had to continue working as David’s lackey.</p>
<p>His mind would have been more worn down than it was now.</p>
<p>David would have no problems being promoted to a senior knight, unless he was caught in the act.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder that Zobel, who failed to get promoted, quit being a knight while harboring spite for House Valentine.</p>
<p>Perhaps it went like this—he became a pharmacist, but as he wandered around, he caught Leo’s eye and so eventually fell under his command.</p>
<p>This theory turned into certainty.</p>
<p>Yes. This man in front of me now will be the pharmacist in the original novel.</p>
<p>‘The fall of House Valentine. Every aspect of it has a reason.’</p>
<p>As soon as I became sure of Zobel’s identity, this thought occurred to me.</p>
<p>The household’s reliable manpower was taken away, and all that was left were these people: a nanny who abused the ducal ladies of the house, and the servants who turned a blind eye to this transgression.</p>
<p>Then, the only knights left were those who attained their position through deceitful means.</p>
<p>How could such a household not fall to ruin?</p>
<p>Taking my hand off my lips, I slowly leaned back against my seat.</p>
<p>And, tsk, I clicked my tongue.</p>
<p>This was done while I was thinking of how pathetic the Valentines were, but Zobel, as he was in front of me, flinched.</p>
<p>While his shoulders shook, he scratched the back of his head awkwardly.</p>
<p>“Of course… I’m being too shameless, aren’t I, Milady? It’s ridiculous for me to strive to become a pharmacist when I once made medicine to harass other people…”</p>
<p>“No, I’m rooting for you though?”</p>
<p>Before that discouraged voice could continue his bout of self-deprecation, I cut him short.</p>
<p>Here in front of me was someone who had potential, so he shouldn’t be discouraged.</p>
<p>Rather than ordering him around with threats, it was better to boost his confidence with positive reinforcement.</p>
<p>If you just whip someone who already had low self-esteem, then their efficiency would just drop further.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>Bewildered, he asked back. However, I soon replied with a smile directed at him.</p>
<p>“Exactly that, I’m rooting for you. I’ll even support you.”</p>
<p>“Su…pport?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I believe you’ll be quite the talented pharmacist.”</p>
<p>At the gently spoken words, the man’s cheeks turned red.</p>
<p>It was as if he had never in his life heard a compliment before.</p>
<p>“N…Not at all, Milady. That’s not possible. I’m not talented, not at all.”</p>
<p>While waving his hands in the air as though he was swimming, my expression grew stiff when he denied it outright.</p>
<p>Watching me lean back fully as I tapped the armrest of my seat, the man’s gaze quickly became filled with tension.</p>
<p>“Then, are you saying that my eyes are wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that, but…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it easy for you to make effective medicine in a short period of time?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“That’s what you would call talent—and I acknowledge your talent. I’m not saying this lightly, and these aren’t empty words. Just take it as it is.”</p>
<p>If given a compliment with a smile, it’s obvious that he would think that it’s a lie.</p>
<p>‘He must be denying it right now, thinking that I’m just being considerate of him.’</p>
<p>People who lacked confidence usually wouldn’t take compliments at face value.</p>
<p>They’d think that the person complimenting them was just them being kind and considerate.</p>
<p>That’s why I deliberately hardened my expression and spoke firmly.</p>
<p>With the carrot and stick approach done in a short span of time, Zobel was at a complete loss. He immediately bowed fully with his head practically slammed to the ground.</p>
<p>However, his first reaction was clearly a questioning look that said, ‘Maybe?’</p>
<p>Just as I thought, he was suspicious of whether I was being sincere or not.</p>
<p>Until now, he remained awkwardly silent, but his lips soon opened hesitantly.</p>
<p>“But then— I’m someone who’s caused damage to House Valentine…”</p>
<p>“And I’m someone who’ll support you. As far as I know, I don’t think you’ve ever harmed me directly though?”</p>
<p>“Can I truly be of help to you, Milady?”</p>
<p>The question was answered with another question, but this wasn’t a bad response.</p>
<p>This was enough to prove that he was slowly leaning towards accepting it.</p>
<p>Softening my hard expression now, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Of course. You’ll be of great help. I’ll give you my full support. If you ever become a commendable pharmacist, I’ll even help you earn a lot of money.”</p>
<p>At the enticing suggestion, Zobel wavered and raised his head.</p>
<p>Beneath the empty gaze of his carrot-colored eyes, a hint of vigor was faintly restored.</p>
<p>Gulp. The man’s adam’s apple bobbed up and down as he gulped dryly.</p>
<p>His lips, which hesitated for a very long time, opened carefully.</p>
<p>It’s clear that the next question he was to utter was the one he’d been wanting to ask the most.</p>
<p>“But why me, and why go through all that trouble?”</p>
<p>It was practically the first time he didn’t stutter.</p>
<p>I paused for a moment, pondering how I should answer. I decided to say what I wanted to say.</p>
<p>The reason I wanted him on my side.</p>
<p>The reason why I’m doing all this for Zobel.</p>
<p>“There’s a medicine that I just know you can make.”</p>
<p>A few days later, Zobel resigned from the knight order.</p>
<p>However, he still remained in House Valentine.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 83</p>
<p>That’s how he became a pharmacist.</p>
<p>After receiving permission from Blanca, I got Logan as his teacher.</p>
<p>However, it’s still uncertain whether he was completely trustworthy, so Cassion’s identity remained a secret with him.</p>
<p>All I told him was that Maxwell and I were very close friends.</p>
<p>Zobel assisted Logan in making the elixir.</p>
<p>With that matter as well, Zobel was just told that the elixir was to make my friend, who became my escort knight, stronger.</p>
<p>And so, back to the present—</p>
<p>‘Well… Even with his skills now, he’s not bad as a pharmacist. To the point that you wouldn’t believe he was a knight before.’</p>
<p>After uttering a bitter compliment towards Zobel, Logan spoke again.</p>
<p>“Your Ladyship, why do you keep pulling in only strange people?”</p>
<p>The amusing remark made me smile widely.</p>
<p>“To begin with, the representative of all these strange people is your master. You know that, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m also aware that it includes the Madam.”</p>
<p>He spoke honestly with a calm tone. Shrugging, I pushed myself off the windowsill.</p>
<p>Then, I walked unhurriedly towards the empty sofa.</p>
<p>“Who knows… Well, let’s see in the future.”</p>
<p>Logan smiled sardonically. Behind the silver-rimmed glasses, his eyes weren’t smiling at all.</p>
<p>I sat down on the empty sofa and leaned back.</p>
<p>It was a seat situated next to the bed, so no matter where I turned my eyes, I’d still see Cassion at the end of my gaze.</p>
<p>“In any case, what did Zobel say? Did he find out anything about Ria’s illness?”</p>
<p>As soon as Ria’s name was mentioned, Diana reacted without a sound.</p>
<p>She seemed to be suppressing her emotions, but there was no way to hide the ever so minute trembling of her fingertips, or the way her shoulders were so tense.</p>
<p>Logan had never seen Diana react in such a way.</p>
<p>Even though she was like that next to him, Logan still answered in the same calm and businesslike tone.</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been easy. It’s only been less than a month since he started taking charge of Ria. Though I do think that he’s gotten closer to her.”</p>
<p>“That’s right, Milady. I’ve also seen from time to time how kind he is to Ria. And she’s also good at following his words.”</p>
<p>Diana added this cautiously.</p>
<p>Though her shoulders continued to be tense, there was a warm smile on her lips.</p>
<p>When he became a pharmacist, the first task Zobel had was to examine Ria.</p>
<p>It was a special task because he’d only be able to make the medicine for her illness if he knew about it well.</p>
<p>“Right. That’s good then.”</p>
<p>At first, Logan examined Ria two or three times a week, then Zobel would check her condition again one more time.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he was characteristically gentle, he and the child seemed to get along well.</p>
<p>“Since we’re talking about the elixir, wouldn’t you need Zobel’s help once you start making it?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m done researching the process of how to make it, and all that’s left is the actual formulation. As for the other formulation methods, it’s enough for me to study them myself.”</p>
<p>Anyway, Logan was still mainly in charge of the elixir, so Zobel would only be assisting him from the side.</p>
<p>“Well… Then, inform Zobel. It’s now time to slowly start working on the research for Ria’s medication.”</p>
<p>I’ll provide the needed ingredients within the next few months at the latest.</p>
<p>“……!”</p>
<p>Ever since Ria had been mentioned earlier, Diana’s expression was stiff. However now, there was a bright smile in the place where tension had once been.</p>
<p>She kept her lips closed as though to control her surprise, but her round eyes were full of anticipation.</p>
<p>As I rubbed the pad of my thumb with another finger’s nail, I smiled.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Now then, please say ‘ah’.”</p>
<p>“Ahh—”</p>
<p>Ria followed after Zobel’s instruction.</p>
<p>A child as young as her would be brimming with playful energy, but whenever it was time for her check-ups, she would become very obedient.</p>
<p>She was sickly ever since she was very young, so she was used to seeing doctors.</p>
<p>After taking a look into the child’s small mouth, he held up a piece of candy for her.</p>
<p>Ria smiled and put the candy into her pocket.</p>
<p>“How are you feeling today?”</p>
<p>“Good!”</p>
<p>“Do you feel uncomfortable anywhere?”</p>
<p>“Nope!”</p>
<p>Ria’s words were believable.</p>
<p>She realized earlier on that it was difficult to hide the pain.</p>
<p>This child was always honest about her physical condition.</p>
<p>Zobel grinned and patted her round head.</p>
<p>By then, the sound of chimes could be heard from the door.</p>
<p>This meant that someone had arrived.</p>
<p>Logan and Zobel’s workplace was in a small building situated between the knightage and the annex of the Valentine family’s manor.</p>
<p>There were three medical facilities inside the estate, and this one was for the servants and the knights.</p>
<p>However, Logan’s clinic was moreso visited by servants rather than knights.</p>
<p>Wondering if a patient had come in, Zobel stood up from his seat.</p>
<p>Though he soon found out that it was Logan and Diana who had entered.</p>
<p>“Teacher! And Miss Diana.”</p>
<p>At Zobel’s call, Ria hurriedly climbed onto her chair so she could peek.</p>
<p>The moment she saw Diana from behind the table, Ria jumped out of the chair with a big smile.</p>
<p>“Ria!”</p>
<p>Surprised, Diana exclaimed, but she caught Ria into her embrace readily.</p>
<p>“Ha… really…”</p>
<p>A sigh of relief and worry slipped through Diana’s lips.</p>
<p>Logan glanced at the two sisters, then he sat down behind his desk.</p>
<p>“How is she doing?”</p>
<p>While still holding Ria in her arms, Diana carefully asked Zobel.</p>
<p>Zobel nodded and gave the older sister a pleasant smile.</p>
<p>“She’s doing good. Her complexion’s better, and overall, her condition won’t deteriorate quickly.”</p>
<p>Though in other words, her condition was still steadily worsening.</p>
<p>Diana already knew this, but she thought about why exactly it was like that.</p>
<p>Her younger sister had been administered some strange medicine all this time, and just recalling that fact made Diana’s blood boil.</p>
<p>And in the end, the worsening of the disease couldn’t be stopped.</p>
<p>All that could be done right now was to make the deterioration slower.</p>
<p>“One of the medicinal herbs that Her Ladyship told me to use in the formulation is good for detoxification. Thanks to that, the effects of poisoning from those illegal medications have been reduced a lot.”</p>
<p>Logan said this as he rummaged through his coat pocket and took out a notebook, where he jotted down some notes with a pen.</p>
<p>Diana paused and looked back at Logan. Then, she closed her eyes and smiled.</p>
<p>Beneath the closed lids, she could see Rosetta’s face.</p>
<p>A roof over their head, walls surrounding them, a floor beneath their feet, and food provided for them. What came to Diana’s mind was Rosetta’s face when she said that she would become anything for the two sisters.</p>
<p>“As expected, Lady Rosetta is…”</p>
<p>Diana murmured faintly as she opened her eyes once more.</p>
<p>“Zobel has worked very hard on creating the medicine, too.”</p>
<p>Logan, too, added with a murmur.</p>
<p>Diana’s eyes widened, then she gave Zobel a smile.</p>
<p>“Sir Zobel, thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“No, I just… I only did… did it as it was written.”</p>
<p>It’s been a while since his voice broke out into a stutter, but it was because he was still not familiar with receiving compliments.</p>
<p>Turning his back on the sight of those kids, Logan compiled the data.</p>
<p>A bit later, Diana left the clinic with Ria in her arms.</p>
<p>She was here thanks to Rosetta’s kindness. She allowed Diana to leave work early today because she knew that it was Ria’s check-up day.</p>
<p>After the child and her older sister left, the clinic was left with silence.</p>
<p>Zobel helped Logan until late that day, then he turned in for the night.</p>
<p>That is, Logan made Zobel stop working with a sharp shake of his head.</p>
<p>One would instantly think that Logan was being cold, but Zobel wasn’t hurt by this at all.</p>
<p>Logan was acting cold, but Zobel knew that his teacher was a warm-hearted person.</p>
<p>A while ago when Lady Rosetta’s name was mentioned to credit Ria’s medication, didn’t Logan bring up Zobel’s name, too?</p>
<p>Zobel liked how Logan showed subtle acts of kindness, and for that, he looked up to Logan a lot.</p>
<p>He was the opposite of David.</p>
<p>Right, the opposite of the kind of person Lady Rosetta was.</p>
<p>Someone who looked a bit difficult to gauge and seemed very cold, but nevertheless treated people they regarded as ‘my people’ with kindness.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he recalled the day that the ducal lady said that she’d support him.</p>
<p>When he asked why she’d go to that extent for him, she just said that there was a medicine that she wanted him to make.</p>
<p>‘It’s not some strange drug—my person’s family member is sick. I need you to make medicine to cure that illness.’</p>
<p>When the ducal lady said ‘my person’, her expression was difficult to describe.</p>
<p>At first glance, what flashed across her features to be along the lines of kindness, coldness and pity. However, there seemed to be a hint of anger as well.</p>
<p>Seeing her show those kinds of emotions, Zobel felt that he wanted to be one of her people, too.</p>
<p>“Her Ladyship asked me to deliver a message.”</p>
<p>While Zobel was praising Logan and Rosetta inwardly, he blinked up at Logan the moment he heard the word ‘lady’.</p>
<p>Somehow, just like a man who’d been caught doing something wrong.</p>
<p>Seeing the unnecessary reaction from Zobel, Logan raised one eyebrow, but he continued speaking.</p>
<p>“She said that she’d get the ingredients for you in a few months at the latest, so right now, you have to start preparing to research how to make Ria’s medicine.”</p>
<p>“Ah, the ingredients.”</p>
<p>His carrot-colored eyes brightened up at the mention of ingredients and research.</p>
<p>Logan stared at the younger man wordlessly, then he asked a question that he’d been wanting to ask for a while now.</p>
<p>“By the way, what are those ‘ingredients’? I don’t think I’ve heard exactly what they’ll be.”</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>Instead of answering Logan’s question right away, Zobel held his breath anxiously.</p>
<p>Zobel looked like he was being extremely careful about this, so for a moment now, Logan slightly regretted that he asked for no reason.</p>
<p>However, the answer that was returned to him was far from the cautious answer he was expecting.</p>
<p>“I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>The hum that passed through Logan’s lips was not unjustified. That’s how incredulous the situation was.</p>
<p>Even the main pharmacist in charge did not know what the ingredients would be.</p>
<p>“All I heard is that one of the ingredients is something that hasn’t appeared in the world yet, that’s why it’ll take some time to get it ready…”</p>
<p>‘An ingredient that has yet to appear in the world, huh…’</p>
<p>Logan silently brooded over what Zobel said.</p>
<p>It was something that he couldn’t comprehend, but strangely, he also understood it.</p>
<p>‘No wonder. Is that why she didn’t put in a request with the Madam?’</p>
<p>Then, he speculated.</p>
<p>She commissioned the Madam to procure all the ingredients for the elixir, but oddly enough, she didn’t request any medicine or any ingredients related to Ria’s disease.</p>
<p>He wanted to ask just what kind of undiscovered ingredient it was and how exactly she knew about it if it had yet to appear in the world, but Logan shook his head without hesitation.</p>
<p>Given his long experience of working under Blanca, he knew that the easiest way to handle this was to bury these questions.</p>
<p>She always denied it, but in many aspects, Rosetta really did resemble his master.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 84</p>
<p>Slowly, I lifted my heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>As my eyesight adjusted to my surroundings, it was exceptionally bright.</p>
<p>Beneath the cloudless sky, white flowers bloomed upon a field, swaying along with the wind.</p>
<p>Peach blossoms. No, perhaps magnolias.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the flowers’ sweet fragrance reached the tip of my nose.</p>
<p>It was an unfamiliar yet familiar scent.</p>
<p>And only then did I realize what I was lying on.</p>
<p>‘A boulder.’</p>
<p>I was lying on a broad flat boulder that looked as though it was carved.</p>
<p>I blinked my heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>After sweeping both hands over my face, I noticed the long sleeves over my arms, which made a sound as I moved.</p>
<p>Maybe.</p>
<p>No, I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>This was a dream.</p>
<p>A dream about the second transmigration.</p>
<p>‘How long has it been since I had a vivid dream, I wonder.’</p>
<p>It was the first time after I had dreamt of Urien, which happened after I visited the dungeon last time.</p>
<p>I’ve had so many nightmares and hogwash dreams before this that I’d become sick and tired of them, but this was so unusually vivid.</p>
<p>‘Why the hell does this keep happening.’</p>
<p>It was only the second time that I’m experiencing a vivid dream. But if you put it another way, it repeated a second time.</p>
<p>I’ve lived through multiple transmigrations, but it’s the first time I’m experiencing it in this round.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and thought.</p>
<p>It’s been a while, but I was so vividly experiencing this body’s strong condition again.</p>
<p>This body felt so light that it couldn’t be compared to the weak body of a duke’s daughter.</p>
<p>That’s right. I used to travel across the world with this body.</p>
<p>But how long had I been lying just like that?</p>
<p>Shortly, a sharp sound coming in from the side, and a presence.</p>
<p>Hearing the sound that was purposely not concealed, my eyes quickly turned to see who it was.</p>
<p>And there, the person who made that sound looked back at me.</p>
<p>He was a tall young man who had a limber body and long hair.</p>
<p>Though his eyes were covered with a white cloth, his lips were smiling as they slowly opened to speak.</p>
<p>“Seola¹.”</p>
<p>The voice that spoke was deep, gentle.</p>
<p>I thought that this voice would sound alien to my ears because it’s been a long time since I last heard it, but it didn’t feel unfamiliar at all. Perhaps because this was a dream.</p>
<p>Staring blankly at him, I opened my lips.</p>
<p>“Mogi Oraboni²…”</p>
<p>In the second transmigration, he was my older brother, who taught me how to make the elixir. Shin Mog. That’s his name.</p>
<p>His eyes were always covered by a white cloth. His eyes were injured many years prior before the birth of the person I was possessing.</p>
<p>So, I never got to see those eyes of his as they were covered with white cloth.</p>
<p>I didn’t know the color of his eyes, the shape of his eyes, the length of his lashes.</p>
<p>Immediately after I possessed the body of Baek Seol, I became very afraid of him.</p>
<p>All that I had to disguise myself was this outer shell. And for someone who did not rely on his eyes, he might see right through me.</p>
<p>I was afraid that he, whose eyes were closed beneath that white cloth, would be able to capture my very essence.</p>
<p>I was so incredibly afraid of that.</p>
<p>But for some reason or another, I became close to him.</p>
<p>Because he was the only one who took pity on me, amongst the siblings who held no affection for each other.</p>
<p>His sympathy was like rain over a drought-stricken land as I tried to navigate this difficult world.</p>
<p>I had no idea why he sympathized with me.</p>
<p>Perhaps he felt sorry for this body, which was weak compared to the other siblings.</p>
<p>Perhaps it’s because I vomited blood every time I trained, and I had to beg him for medicine every single day.</p>
<p>He was called the ‘Austere Crane’ by others, and yet he was especially kind to me.</p>
<p>He was originally an outstanding martial arts warrior, but he lost his eyesight, which prompted him to dive into researching medicine. In the end, he showed a particular talent in making man-made elixirs.</p>
<p>Many people wanted to become a disciple under his tutelage so that they could be taught how to make the elixirs.</p>
<p>However, the only one he took in under his wing as a student and taught how to make the elixir was me.</p>
<p>‘Seola, keep mastering it. I’m certain that it’ll one day be of help to you.’</p>
<p>Through the coldblooded and eternally frosty gaze, there was a gap in his countenance as he regarded me warmly as family rather than as the ‘Austere Crane’. And at the same time, he was also my esteemed teacher.</p>
<p>When I hit my head on the ground and met my demise during that second transmigration, the only face that came to my mind was Mogi Oraboni’s.</p>
<p>Sometimes he said this.</p>
<p>That, maybe because he had been robbed of his eyesight, he looked at things differently compared to others.</p>
<p>Saying so, it was only sometimes that the white cloth over his eyes would become soaked.</p>
<p>Those eyes beneath the cloth, which I had never seen before, became wet at that time.</p>
<p>‘Poor thing. You poor thing…’</p>
<p>Tears that were both cold and warm flowed down his eyes as he repeated these words over and over.</p>
<p>All the while, he also stroked my hair.</p>
<p>His voice, as he recited the same words to me, was so terribly sorrowful that, after this, I cried secretly to myself a few times while remembering it.</p>
<p>Here in my dream, I walked through the field while looking at Mogi Oraboni’s broad back.</p>
<p>The white flowers, which had grown tall, tickled my ankles.</p>
<p>“Seola.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Oraboni.”</p>
<p>Every time he took a step and every time the wind blew, Oraboni’s long, dark hair fluttered along.</p>
<p>The last time I saw Oraboni was during that tearful scene, and so I couldn’t help but bite my lips as I’m now meeting him again after a long time.</p>
<p>“I wish for you to master your techniques slowly, very slowly.”</p>
<p>After saying this, he stopped walking.</p>
<p>The same moment Mogi Oraboni’s strides came to a halt, the wind that was blowing stopped as well.</p>
<p>When the wind stopped, the petals that were dancing along with the breeze seemingly halted mid-air.</p>
<p>And here, the petals fell much slower towards the ground, as if it was a rain of petals.</p>
<p>It was truly a scene that was suitable for the celestial realm.</p>
<p>With a somewhat restrained voice, I replied to him.</p>
<p>“But, Oraboni. Wouldn’t that put my life in danger?”</p>
<p>He slowly turned around.</p>
<p>The eyes hidden by that white cloth remained to be unknown.</p>
<p>His fine lips drew a beautiful smile.</p>
<p>“…Who knows. Still, I feel regrettable about how you left. I guess you could say that I’ve grown attached to you.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Not knowing what he was talking about, I asked back. But at this, he smiled silently and stroked my hair.</p>
<p>From the time that I was very young, until the time that I learned martial arts and went back and forth between the mortal realm and the celestial realm.</p>
<p>He stroked my hair just as he usually did.</p>
<p>“Seola.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Oraboni.”</p>
<p>“Perhaps all of Mount Baek’s disciples, along with the disciple brothers and disciple sisters from the same master—they could all have descended already if the only thing you need to do is prepare yourself with all that’s needed to be prepared.”</p>
<p>At one point, I also descended.</p>
<p>It was only a moment, but it felt like I was riding a cloud.</p>
<p>Oraboni continued speaking quietly, and his voice was like the breeze of a fine spring day.</p>
<p>“I suppose that’s how it is.”</p>
<p>Along where his eyes should be, the white cloth became wet.</p>
<p>Without saying a word, I stared at the white cloth as it continued to be soaked.</p>
<p>“I wish for you to descend very slowly.”</p>
<p>“Oraboni.”</p>
<p>“I wish for you to have fewer hardships, even if it could be lessened only a little.”</p>
<p>“Oraboni… Why are you saying these things.”</p>
<p>“Where else will you be going this time, I wonder, on these wandering travels.”</p>
<p>The hand that was stroking my hair stopped.</p>
<p>He smiled sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Wept, sorrowfully.</p>
<p>Smiling and crying, he said one last thing.</p>
<p>“Seola, poor child.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With my eyes slowly fluttering open, I woke up from the dream.</p>
<p>Unlike the nightmare where I saw Urien, I did not wake up screaming or feeling as if I was being chased.</p>
<p>‘What kind of dream was that?’</p>
<p>It was such a vivid dream.</p>
<p>It really felt like I was there, like I really met Mogi Oraboni.</p>
<p>That’s why, even if we had talked only in a dream, it felt like a truly meaningful conversation.</p>
<p>He talked in that way from time to time. While seeing something else with his unseeing eyes, he spoke in that way towards me.</p>
<p>‘Where else will you be going this time, I wonder, on these wandering travels.’</p>
<p>‘Poor child.’</p>
<p>Still, his clear voice rang behind my ears.</p>
<p>Tears welled up at the corner of my eyes, and so I blinked and wiped them away.</p>
<p>Through my cloudy vision, I saw Cassion’s back.</p>
<p>And seeing the appearance of that familiar person made me finally realize that this was the reality I was living in now.</p>
<p>Pushing aside my thoughts of the dream, I fiddled with the blanket.</p>
<p>It seemed as though the place I woke up in was Cassion’s room, and I was in his bed.</p>
<p>‘How did I fall asleep?’</p>
<p>While staring at the man’s wide back, I tried to grapple with my memories from before I fell asleep.</p>
<p>It was Ria’s check-up day, so Diana left work early.</p>
<p>Since Logan was going the same direction, I told them to go back together.</p>
<p>So I stayed in this room alone, watching Cassion as he slept and, at the same time, organizing my plans for the future.</p>
<p>That’s all I could remember.</p>
<p>It seemed like I succumbed to slumber while I was on the sofa.</p>
<p>However, I woke up lying in this bed, not on that sofa.</p>
<p>The sofa where I fell asleep had only one small cushion.</p>
<p>Looking alternately between the empty sofa and the window, I soon opened my lips to speak.</p>
<p>“What’re you doing.”</p>
<p>Because I had just woken up, my voice was a bit raspy.</p>
<p>At the succinct question, the man calmly turned his head to look this way.</p>
<p>“You’re awake?”</p>
<p>“Why are you up when you’re the patient? Why am I lying here, again.”</p>
<p>“The one who’s sleeping should lie down, and the one who’s awake should get up.”</p>
<p>With a small smile, I got up from the bed. His black eyes watched as I did, and he spoke.</p>
<p>“Why. You should lie down more.”</p>
<p>“You just said that someone who’s awake should get up.”</p>
<p>“…If there’s a contest to rank people who always get the last word in, you’ll be ranked the first in all of the Empire.”</p>
<p>One eyebrow twitched as he said that, though he answered with a smile.</p>
<p>As I got up on my feet, I went to stand next to Cassion.</p>
<p>While he looked towards the bed, he was leaning back against the windowsill, and on that same windowsill, I leaned over with my chest against the frame.</p>
<p>I could only hear our breathing going alternately as we were looking at different things.</p>
<p>Amid the dark silence, Cassion turned his head once our breathing had synced.</p>
<p>And as I felt his gaze on the side of my face, I also turned to look at him.</p>
<p>In that close distance, our eyes met.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>“Why do you ask?”</p>
<p>The sudden question was answered with another question.</p>
<p>“Until just now, you looked like you weren’t alright, so I couldn’t ask. Still, your complexion is better today. So I wanted to ask.”</p>
<p>‘Are you alright?’</p>
<p>I recalled the same question I’ve heard before.</p>
<p>‘Until just now, you didn’t look like you were doing alright, La³.’</p>
<p>The two questions conflated on top of one another.</p>
<p>Seemed like I didn’t look well.</p>
<p>And somewhere in another world, in that other body, I also didn’t look alright.</p>
<p>Cassion wasn’t originally quick-witted when it came to these things.</p>
<p>Especially when it’s being hidden, he’s not supposed to notice like a ghost.</p>
<p>Rolling my tongue inside my mouth, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm, I’m fine.”</p>
<p>Again, there was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>The night was essentially a period of quietude, so the silence wasn’t strange.</p>
<p>This time, I was the first to break that silence.</p>
<p>“How about you, are you alright? You look better now, so I’m also asking.”</p>
<p>Hearing the question uttered with a playful tone, Cassion’s eyes met mine across the distance between us.</p>
<p>A silly smile graced his lips as he, too, nodded.</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm, I’m also doing good.”</p>
<p>The silly answer matched his silly smile.</p>
<p>After smiling back briefly as well, I spoke again.</p>
<p>“You’re not asking, by the way.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“About what happened during the funeral. Why zoned out as though I’d gone mad that day.”</p>
<p>After asking if the other’s alright or not alright, that’s where we started.</p>
<p>In the middle of the subsequent silence, his quiet eyes turned to me.</p>
<p>“If you have a reason to tell me, then you will tell me. There’s no need to pry.”</p>
<p>His tone was calm.</p>
<p>Even calmer than when he was asking me if I was alright.</p>
<p>As I stared at him wordlessly, Cassion tilted his head slightly as though to ask if there was something wrong.</p>
<p>I averted my gaze.</p>
<p>Perhaps because I was staring into his black eyes, but the darkened room didn’t look so dark now.</p>
<p>“…I thought I saw a monster. One that’s been chasing after me for a long time, that monster.”</p>
<p>“Monster…”</p>
<p>It was a strange thing to hear about, but Cassion didn’t pry.</p>
<p>However, he gave just this answer.</p>
<p>“There’s no monster that you can’t defeat.”</p>
<p>Perhaps succour, perhaps not.</p>
<p>What I was sure of was this— whatever purpose he had in saying that, I felt at ease once more.</p>
<p>“Indeed, that’s true.”</p>
<p>Feeling better now, I smiled again.</p>
<p>Beneath this dark, pitch black sky, the night was filled with laughter.</p>
<p>1. After Seol and Mog’s names are the sounds ‘a/ah’ and ‘i/ee’. When these syllables are added to someone’s name, they turn into a nickname as they’re called by someone who’s close to them. Their actual names are just Seol and Mog.</p>
<p>Additionally, Mog’s full name is ‘Shin Mog’, but Shin is his last name and Mog is his given name. Likewise with ‘Baek Seol’.</p>
<p>2. Oraboni = Older brother. I decided to leave the word as it is since we’re in an eastern setting this time.</p>
<p>(Rosetta and Alicia also call Damian ‘Oraboni’, but I’ve been translating that word to ‘Brother’ since the novel they’re in has a western setting.)</p>
<p>3. La = could also be ‘Ra’ because Hangul has just one character for ‘R’ and ‘L’.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 85</p>
<p>After talking aimlessly all night, I finally managed to get Cassion to lay back down on his bed.</p>
<p>Cassion kept saying he’s fine, but I wasn’t fine with it.</p>
<p>First of all, he was still a patient, so this couldn’t go on.</p>
<p>While I sat on the sofa that was beside the bed, I reached forward to sweep aside a lock of his hair that was clinging to his forehead.</p>
<p>“Once autumn comes, there will be a hunting festival. You know about this, right?”</p>
<p>“You mean the one that takes place around October?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. And after that, there will be a ball to celebrate the hunting festival.”</p>
<p>When my hand brushed against the top of his brows, his black eyelashes trembled slightly.</p>
<p>However, even at that moment, the gaze beneath the lashes was directed only at me.</p>
<p>Seeing this pleased me somehow, so I deliberately touched his brows once more.</p>
<p>With his lashes trembling slightly again, Cassion replied.</p>
<p>“Since you’re mentioning it, does that mean I’ll have to participate?”</p>
<p>Instead of an answer, I gave a small chuckle. This silence was also another way to say yet.</p>
<p>Though the verbal answer still came later.</p>
<p>Well, it was only after his eyelashes trembled three more times that I opened my lips to speak.</p>
<p>“Yes. You have to go. Where else should you go if not there. That’s the place where you can show off and run wild.”</p>
<p>‘Show off’ and ‘run wild’.</p>
<p>Cassion’s brows rumpled slightly as the two phrases that were mentioned bothered him a bit.</p>
<p>“It won’t be at the ball, but at the hunting festival, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s why you should focus on getting well and training hard. I’ll have a new sword made for you.”</p>
<p>“What about my face? Of course, I’m not sure if anyone will recognize me anyway, but it might be better to cover my face.”</p>
<p>I can understand what he’s worried about.</p>
<p>The hunting festival was one of the biggest events that the imperial family regularly held.</p>
<p>Most of the aristocracy would attend, and naturally, the high nobles would as well.</p>
<p>As it was just around the coming-of-age ceremony, and while he was as good as declared the successor to their duchy, Leo would certainly be present.</p>
<p>His and Cassion’s mother as well.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>With my hand touching his hair still, it went down to caress the man’s cheek.</p>
<p>His expression was grim as he was contemplating over the matter, but his face soon grew stiff as though he had become a broken machine.</p>
<p>His cheek was smooth.</p>
<p>“I’ll give you a mask so that you won’t get recognized.”</p>
<p>And it was a tad bit hot as though its temperature had risen.</p>
<p>While hardened like that, he stared at me with those dark eyes, but he soon leaned his cheek against my hand.</p>
<p>Even throughout this small movement, his eyes did not leave mine at all.</p>
<p>“I guess you really aren’t feeling well. Seeing as how you’re letting yourself be pampered like this.”</p>
<p>“…You too, though. Don’t you still have a slight fever?”</p>
<p>Again, I laughed instead of answering.</p>
<p>Right, I did think to myself that I still might have a slight fever.</p>
<p>With my back facing the window, the dim light of the dawn broke through.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Within a few days, Cassion recovered from his sickbed completely.</p>
<p>Truthfully, even though he had been sick, it’s still funny how he had that fever.</p>
<p>Still, after his clean recovery, Cassion immediately jumped back into his training.</p>
<p>The mention of the ‘hunting festival’ along with the recent funeral where he met Leo seemed to be a pretty good motivation boost for him.</p>
<p>Every day, there seemed to be flames surging in his black eyes.</p>
<p>As Cassion gritted his teeth again, there came a change in his training schedule.</p>
<p>Because he was set to have a match with another knight before this, his training had been divided into 60% swordsmanship and 40% magic. This time, however, it was changed to 30% swordsmanship and 70% magic.</p>
<p>Cassion was aiming to become the head of a mage household, not a knight household, so it was only natural for his training to be this way.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Logan had become busier in the last few weeks.</p>
<p>Nowadays, Cassion’s training started being focused on incorporating his magic into his swordsmanship.</p>
<p>This was so he could be endowed with the title of a ‘mage knight’.</p>
<p>Since there was no concept of a mage knight in this world, when I first mentioned it to them, Cassion, Logan and Diana had been greatly taken aback.</p>
<p>However, their astonishment was only for a short moment.</p>
<p>If it’s something they had to do anyway, wouldn’t it be better to jump right into it without hesitation?</p>
<p>Those three people—and Blanca as well as she received the news—put their heads together and began to think about this deeper.</p>
<p>‘The most ideal fighting style is close combat swordsmanship with long-range magic, right?’</p>
<p>‘But then it might be difficult to get the right timing to do the spell incantation. If he shows an opening in his defense in the middle of a battle…’</p>
<p>‘The usual outcome is death, yes.’</p>
<p>‘Also though, I don’t think it’s possible for me to do this and that.’</p>
<p>They tried and tried, but failed to think of a good solution over and over.</p>
<p>However, failure was the mother of success.</p>
<p>After weeks of countless attempts and failures, the fighting style of a ‘mage knight’, which didn’t even exist before this, gradually took hold.</p>
<p>As a result, the form of a mage knight that they’d come to develop was ‘a man who can create a magic sword’.</p>
<p>Starting with a chain of magic while wrapping the sword with mana, the sword itself would then become a ‘man-made magic sword’.</p>
<p>Truthfully, it wasn’t something likely to happen because it was easier said than done.</p>
<p>Mana was an expendable energy and it would take some time to use it as a charge, so it wouldn’t be easy to conjure enough mana to make a solid mass that would take the shape of a sword.</p>
<p>And if something were to go wrong in the middle, it wouldn’t hold out for long and his mana would just run out.</p>
<p>But, then again, who exactly was Cassion?</p>
<p>He’s someone who’s been born with the character setting of, ‘unfortunate genius’.</p>
<p>Well, that’s a thing of the past now.</p>
<p>Since he could wield his mana properly this time, he wasn’t an unfortunate genius anymore.</p>
<p>He’s a genius, period.</p>
<p>Besides that, he was endowed with a body that had a vast amount of mana along with an innate mana affinity that he was born with.</p>
<p>Even without having to utter the incantation, he could still wield his mana and cast the spell properly.</p>
<p>He could easily break the barrier between theory and reality.</p>
<p>As a result, even in the middle of practice battles, it was possible for him to transform a sword into a magic sword that easily.</p>
<p>Just by touching a sword, he could make electricity ripple through it, thereby making a blazing magic sword.</p>
<p>In close range combat, he could fight using his general swordsmanship skills, while with long range, he could immediately shoot out the magic that was wrapped around the blade of his sword.</p>
<p>Since the magic spell had already been cast, there would be no gap between his swordplay and his magic wielding.</p>
<p>Indeed, this was the fighting style of a ‘mage knight’ that was envisioned for him from the start—someone who was good at both close range and long range combat.</p>
<p>‘That… Doesn’t that look like aura?’</p>
<p>One day, Diana observed Cassion’s sword and said this.</p>
<p>Indeed, it’s just as she mentioned. The magic sword, which was coated with mana, was giving off an enigmatic glow.</p>
<p>It looked as if blue and red flames were being intertwined as it glowed.</p>
<p>The sight of it was quite mysterious, so it looked like the sword was instead wrapped with aura.</p>
<p>Still, it was quite different from the real deal.</p>
<p>Well, anyway.</p>
<p>‘The only swordmaster in this world is Duke Valentine, so…’</p>
<p>Only one person in the entire empire. Additionally, it was a duke.</p>
<p>How many people exactly would have actually seen the aura wielded by such a person?</p>
<p>If people who had never seen the real deal, the moment they see Cassion’s sword, they would one hundred percent think that it’s ‘aura’.</p>
<p>There’d be a lot of noise about it for sure.</p>
<p>Later on, once it’s revealed that this power came not from swordsmanship but from magic, then there would be a whole lot more clamor.</p>
<p>And, of course, that’s what I intend to happen.</p>
<p>After Cassion successfully raises his name in the future, wouldn’t it be better to carry with him at least one positive attribute?</p>
<p>Since we’re going up against the main character here, it’s imperative to exert this much effort.</p>
<p>The long box I’m holding right now was also part of this ongoing effort.</p>
<p>Inside this box was a one-of-a-kind item that could never be found anywhere else in the empire, and it was prepared especially for Cassion, who had become the empire’s one and only ‘mage knight’.</p>
<p>I designed it myself, and I commissioned Blanca to have it made, so it’s clear that this is the only one of its kind in this world.</p>
<p>After several weeks of its production, it was completed only today.</p>
<p>“Have you received the sword?”</p>
<p>A voice rang out in the room even as I was the only person inside.</p>
<p>The voice was coming from a crystal ball that was on the table.</p>
<p>It was a crystal ball for communication, which I received from Blanca the other day. Long distance video communication was possible through this.</p>
<p>‘Blanca said that it’s available only in her guild.’</p>
<p>Over the round crystal ball, I saw the Madam’s wide smile.</p>
<p>Instead of picking it up myself, I asked Diana to do it on my behalf.</p>
<p>Ever since the unexpected encounter with Leo at the funeral, I’d become apprehensive about getting involved with him.</p>
<p>It felt as if I got hit by the original plot.</p>
<p>So, I decided to be a little more cautious for the time being.</p>
<p>The big event that was the hunting festival was coming up soon, so I intend to twist the original novel’s plot there as well.</p>
<p>When carrying out an insurrection, was it not a virtue to hold one’s breath before the main event?</p>
<p>Refraining from going out was also part of that tactic.</p>
<p>Because of this, I sent Diana to retrieve the item, but Blanca wanted to check the delivery status with her own eyes.</p>
<p>With the case containing the sword in my hands, I shook it in front of the crystal ball.</p>
<p>Blanca smiled and nodded as though she was satisfied to see this.</p>
<p>“I put so much effort into this sword, so I wanted to make sure it arrived safely to you. And the name of this sword is…”</p>
<p>“Whip sword.”</p>
<p>As I answered briefly, I opened the case.</p>
<p>Click. Accompanied by the sound, the whip sword, the creation of which I had entrusted to her, was now in plain sight.</p>
<p>I took out the sword and set down the empty case.</p>
<p>“Right, whip sword. I’ve never heard of such a sword in my life.”</p>
<p>As I listened to Blanca speak, I examined the sword carefully.</p>
<p>Its scabbard was black. And over that black exterior, there was a subtle engraving of blazing flames.</p>
<p>A fleeting thought passed through my mind that it seemed to represent both Maxwell and Cassion, and so it made me chuckle briefly.</p>
<p>Gripping the hilt, I drew the sword from the scabbard.</p>
<p>Shrrng.</p>
<p>As soon as it was unsheathed, the sound of the sharpened blade cut through the air.</p>
<p>With its slightly vibrating atmosphere and its fricative sound, the blade’s quiet ringing resounded throughout the room.</p>
<p>I examined the blade carefully.</p>
<p>The form of a whip sword was a bit unique.</p>
<p>It looked like a regular sword at its base form, but it would stretch out like a whip once inner strength were to be imbued into it.</p>
<p>This sword, however, would react to mana instead of inner strength.</p>
<p>When looked at closely, the exceptionally thin lines on the sword could be seen.</p>
<p>Once the sword would stretch out from those lines, it would then take on the form of a whip that could be swung.</p>
<p>At the center of the sword were microfibers sustained by mana or inner strength.</p>
<p>After counting over 50 fine lines over the sword, I looked up at Blanca.</p>
<p>“It’s perfect.”</p>
<p>“I did my very best to make it according to your instructions.”</p>
<p>At the restrained praise she received, Blanca gave a captivating smile.</p>
<p>She was overflowing with uninhibited confidence.</p>
<p>Since her confidence was justified, I answered with a nod.</p>
<p>“Have you tried to test it?”</p>
<p>”Unfortunately, I wasn’t able to do that. I don’t have anyone around me who can handle aura or mana, so I didn’t have the chance to modify the sword…”</p>
<p>“Well, indeed, that’s something that couldn’t be helped.”</p>
<p>Right, it was impossible.</p>
<p>Because after all, the only people who can wield this sword were Cassion, Duke Valentine…</p>
<p>And me.</p>
<p>Just the three of us.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 86</p>
<p>“Give it a try first. If you find any problems with it, please contact me right away.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do that. You worked hard on making it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. I worked really hard on it, put all that effort in it. My kids and I went through so much making a sword that we’ve never heard about before.”</p>
<p>[ t/n: she calls her subordinates her ‘kids’ ]</p>
<p>What I said was just for formalities, but then Blanca’s reply quickly followed.</p>
<p>She said it in a quick, clear tone, her brows raised as she smiled a picturesque smile.</p>
<p>Whenever she acted like this, I could feel that something unpleasant was about to happen.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the next moment.</p>
<p>Blanca covered her lips with one hand as though she was very, very hurt, then she said,</p>
<p>“I went through so many difficulties, but you didn’t even come to receive the item in person. You know, I’ve just been here, waiting patiently for when you’ll come to see me again.”</p>
<p>“Hah.”</p>
<p>Her words instantly gave me a sharp headache. Despite me scoffing at her, she continued her charade.</p>
<p>She suddenly raised her other hand, the one that wasn’t covering her mouth, then fluttered her fingers theatrically.</p>
<p>“You even put a ring on me.”</p>
<p>The diamond ring glimmered brilliantly on her right ring finger.</p>
<p>It was the ring I gave her as commission payment back then.</p>
<p>‘I shouldn’t have given a ring.’</p>
<p>I should have given her something else.</p>
<p>“Right, I gave you that ring. I even gave you the gloves you’re wearing now, right?”</p>
<p>My eyes were narrowed as I replied to her, and Blanca removed the hand that was covering her lips.</p>
<p>There was a refreshing smile on her lips as they were revealed.</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you. It’s a truly rewarding gift in exchange for making the sword.”</p>
<p>In response, Blanca stroked the back of one of her gloved hands as though she were caressing a baby’s cheek.</p>
<p>Every time her hand moved, the lace and tightly embedded jewels in the fabric glittered lustrously. The gloves were made by a master artisan.</p>
<p>Indeed, that pair was worth a fortune.</p>
<p>“I’ll use this well, too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, so enough of that nonsense. Let’s just proceed to discussing the next thing.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, nonsense, you say. I’m hurt.”</p>
<p>Casually ignoring that, I brought up the next topic.</p>
<p>“The item to be auctioned that I asked you to look into last time. How did that go? News about it should be going around these days.”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s on the list of the Arcano auction. It’ll be held after the hunting festival, towards the beginning of winter… Ah. It just so happens to be around your birthday, Lady Valentine.”</p>
<p>‘Rosetta’s birthday is around early November, I think.’</p>
<p>I nodded and repeated Blanca’s words.</p>
<p>“The Arcano auction.”</p>
<p>It was the name of the largest covert auction in the empire.</p>
<p>It was the auction I asked her to look into, and at the same time, it was the one that would supply us the key ingredient for Lia’s medicine, which I promised Zobel.</p>
<p>The ingredient was yet to be named, and it would be first revealed through the Arcano auction.</p>
<p>But there was a problem.</p>
<p>Through the original novel, I could roughly guess around when it’d be held, but not the exact date and time.</p>
<p>That’s why I had to entrust the matter of investigating it to Blanca. After all, there was no such word as ‘secret’ in her vocabulary.</p>
<p>“And the auction house’s location?”</p>
<p>“It hasn’t been announced yet. The Arcano auction’s event details aren’t usually released to the public until just before the event itself.”</p>
<p>Certainly enough, the method in which they hosted this event was true to its reputation.</p>
<p>I rummaged through my mind, trying to see if there was any other relevant information I could glean from the original work. In the meantime, Blanca added as though she was trying to set me at ease.</p>
<p>“But you don’t have to worry. I’ll find out a week before the auction. I’ll even look into the number of seats they’d have inside.”</p>
<p>As she said this, she winked gracefully. At the suggestive wink, I rolled my eyes and shook my head.</p>
<p>“Then, please do so. It’s an auction that cannot be missed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Is there anything else you need?”</p>
<p>“No, not anymore. That’s already a lot for you to do.”</p>
<p>“It’s no trouble. However…”</p>
<p>One hand was waved in the air as she said that it was nothing, but it slowly went back to its place.</p>
<p>She leaned that one arm on the table and propped her chin with her hand.</p>
<p>With her eyes narrowed, her silver irises were touched by a ray of sunlight.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I have a question. May I ask?”</p>
<p>Blanca’s curiosity was likely to tire me out once again, but since she was juggling many responsibilities this time, I nodded in response.</p>
<p>One finger tapped on her cheek.</p>
<p>“How… did you know?”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>Towards the vague question, my answer was likewise an inquiry. I tilted my head to the side.</p>
<p>Even through the crystal ball, her silver eyes twinkled clearly.</p>
<p>“About the item that will appear in the Arcano auction. It’s not even a piece of information that we obtained, so how did you know about it so quickly…”</p>
<p>I’m just curious.</p>
<p>She added in a whisper.</p>
<p>Beyond the crystal ball, she looked at me expectantly with her torso slightly tilted forward.</p>
<p>And beneath that playful smile, there was a hint of genuine curiosity.</p>
<p>No, actually, her excitement just couldn’t be hidden.</p>
<p>For a moment, it crossed my mind that this might be the reason why she goes around wearing a veil.</p>
<p>If she constantly showed that kind of curiosity, who on earth would want to entrust her with a commissioned request?</p>
<p>They’d just run away instead.</p>
<p>I leaned back against my seat.</p>
<p>Only then did the space between us return to what it was before.</p>
<p>“Why, are you afraid that I’m two-timing you with another guild?”</p>
<p>As I asked, Blanca shook her head as though it was far from what she was thinking.</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t get a tip-off about something like that. Who would have gotten that intel first anyway. Even if you were two-timing, they wouldn’t know that information.”</p>
<p>“Still full of confidence, are we.”</p>
<p>“That’s my charm.”</p>
<p>“Yup, sounds about right.”</p>
<p>After I answered briefly, I blinked in a daze.</p>
<p>Look at all that confidence.</p>
<p>Of course, I couldn’t tell her the truth.</p>
<p>But I don’t think she’d be happy if I’d tell her about some made-up reason. It’s the same the other way around if she said nonsense to me.</p>
<p>After thinking about it for a second, I opened my lips to speak.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a faint glimmer in the silver gaze that was staring intently at me.</p>
<p>“It’s possible after reading many books.”</p>
<p>At the matter-of-fact tone thrown at her, Blanca’s expression fleetingly hardened.</p>
<p>Her expression had grown awkward for that one moment, but a smile soon graced her face.</p>
<p>I just knew that she was going to laugh any second now, so I took the initiative to intercept.</p>
<p>“I’m hanging up. I need to go and test the sword.”</p>
<p>“My oh my, how truly col—”</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>Her loud voice was promptly cut short, and the screen disappeared as well.</p>
<p>I stared at the blank crystal ball, then turned my gaze to the window.</p>
<p>The weather was good.</p>
<p>It was the perfect weather to test this sword.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With the sword fastened to my back, I left my room.</p>
<p>My hair was tied up in a ponytail, and I intentionally wore a skirt with a slit on the side since I had no pants here.</p>
<p>I should at least have one piece of clothing that I could move comfortably in, so I had this prepared.</p>
<p>Leaving the comforts of my room and going out the door of the detached mansion, I moved as fast as I could.</p>
<p>On the outside, Rosetta looked the furthest from a person who knew martial arts, but if anyone were to see me moving like this, they’d obviously think that I am practicing martial arts.</p>
<p>It’s better not to run into anyone.</p>
<p>Moving in that way, I went to the back of the detached mansion and took the first trail path I saw.</p>
<p>It’s the scheduled time for Cassion’s training at the clearing where he often went.</p>
<p>I can’t take up someone else’s training spot, of course.</p>
<p>Besides, I’m still keeping this sword a secret.</p>
<p>In a way, it’s a surprise gift for him, but since it’s not yet completely ready, who on earth would give an unfinished gift?</p>
<p>So now, I needed to find another quiet place that wasn’t the vacant lot. I think it would be alright if it’s a place good enough for training, and at the same time, that no one knew about it.</p>
<p>That’s why this was the path I found.</p>
<p>From behind the detached mansion, it was a path leading nearby the mountain and the gardens, and it was just at the border that’s not much frequented by people.</p>
<p>‘Well, it’s a bit too narrow to even call it a path, but…’</p>
<p>The path we usually took to the clearing was wide and well-maintained, but this one was the opposite.</p>
<p>There were thick bushes and unkempt trees here and there. The only thing that would inform anyone that there’s a path here were the parts where the grass was growing just slightly lower.</p>
<p>Seeing as there were no traces of other people stepping on the grass here, there seemed to have been no one coming and going through this path these days.</p>
<p>‘It’s been a long time since I went this way.’</p>
<p>I trudged through the low-growing grace, walking along the dim path.</p>
<p>It felt much like I was walking on a snow field where no one else had walked through.</p>
<p>The smell of grass enveloped my senses.</p>
<p>The rustling of foliage echoed along with the steps that seemed endless.</p>
<p>From somewhere unknown, a bird’s chirping could also be heard.</p>
<p>I fanned my face a little. I couldn’t feel the sun’s direct heat because of the trees’ shade, but the air was still humid.</p>
<p>Soon, I found a fork in the road.</p>
<p>There was a large tree dividing the path. Compared to the left side, the foliage in the path on the right looked more overgrown.</p>
<p>‘Then…’</p>
<p>The right one.</p>
<p>I took the path on the right on purpose.</p>
<p>Since I came here in search of a place that no one frequented, it’s better to choose the path that looked like no one was going there.</p>
<p>In any case, all I need is a wide clearing.</p>
<p>The grass growing on the path on the right was comparatively shorter. Maybe it’s because the trees’ shadows here were denser, so the grass couldn’t grow taller.</p>
<p>The air was cooler here.</p>
<p>As I walked, the temperature unexpectedly made it feel like it was daybreak during early summer.</p>
<p>I wonder how long I walked.</p>
<p>Still, I soon found the end of the path.</p>
<p>I stopped at the edge of the field, blinking in a daze.</p>
<p>The scenery before me was so very different from what I was expecting.</p>
<p>To be honest, the picture I had in mind was an empty field. Or perhaps a field wrought with the wilderness, full of tall grass.</p>
<p>However, the sight in front of me now was neither a wasteland nor an unkempt field.</p>
<p>Rather than that…</p>
<p>It was a landscape that was reminiscent of the world I lived in during my second transmigration.</p>
<p>Right, it felt close to that.</p>
<p>The grass over here was long enough, too, that they went past my ankle.</p>
<p>Except for that, however, the scenery here was worth admiring.</p>
<p>A small pond.</p>
<p>Flowering trees with delicate leaves, growing here and there.</p>
<p>Wildflowers that were blooming beautifully across the field, interspersed with a couple of boulders.</p>
<p>I took a careful step forward.</p>
<p>Tickling my ankles, the grass here was a little softer compared to the grass on the path I had been walking over so far.</p>
<p>Walking through the flower trees which were planted in a loose circle, I checked the surroundings.</p>
<p>‘It’s the same with the path, too. Judging by how it doesn’t seem to be managed, it’s either a place where people don’t come and go…’</p>
<p>Or a place that’s been abandoned long ago.</p>
<p>The latter seemed highly likely.</p>
<p>The pond hadn’t dried up, but at the same time, it seemed as if it had been man-made somewhat.</p>
<p>The wide boulders also looked as though they’d been cut according to a landscaping design.</p>
<p>Touching the smooth side of the boulder, my hand got caught with a thin layer of moss.</p>
<p>I looked blankly between my hand and the boulder.</p>
<p>Then suddenly, I recalled my dream where I met Mogi Oraboni, and I smiled.</p>
<p>Of course, there was no moss over there.</p>
<p>‘I’ll do it here.’</p>
<p>An abandoned place that no one frequented, and yet it would strangely evoke nostalgia.</p>
<p>Where else would be a better place?</p>
<p>I soon took out my fan. Then, I swung it in a large arc, towards the direction of a myriad of weeds.</p>
<p>Whizz—</p>
<p>The sound of air being cut went off briefly, then it was gone.</p>
<p>Beneath where the sound passed, the grass was cut short.</p>
<p>Staring at the cut grass where a straight path had appeared, I clutched my fan.</p>
<p>Before holding the sword, it would be best to clean up this place first.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 87</p>
<p>After I was done arranging things here, I placed one hand on my waist as I looked around once more.</p>
<p>After cutting the overgrown grass and removing the moss from the pond, the abandoned space soon transformed into a small personal garden.</p>
<p>‘No matter who sees this, it won’t look like an abandoned place anymore.’</p>
<p>Now content with how the landscape transformed because of me, I began to warm up.</p>
<p>Truthfully, I never once tried to use my inner strength properly ever since I regained my abilities.</p>
<p>I didn’t have a clear grasp of my inner strength in the beginning, that’s why it was dangerous to use it back then. But after I had gotten used to it more over time, that’s not a concern anymore.</p>
<p>At best, I had only fought those street thugs from before. I faced Diana as well, and I had a few sparring sessions with Cassion.</p>
<p>Thus far, I didn’t have a proper reason to exert myself, nor was there a reason for me to use my strength, really. So naturally, I had yet to check just how much strength I had at the moment.</p>
<p>So, I was planning to figure that out today.</p>
<p>There’s no one looking, and I just found the perfect clearing to let loose.</p>
<p>At the same time, I also had to test Cassion’s sword.</p>
<p>After stretching my shoulders, I picked up the sword, which I had set down earlier.</p>
<p>One hand was on the sword’s smooth scabbard, the other hand was on the sword’s hilt.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes and taking a deep breath, I felt my five senses becoming sharper.</p>
<p>Shiiing.</p>
<p>The sword was unsheathed.</p>
<p>Similar to how it was in front of Blanca earlier, the well-forged blade appeared while accompanied by the shrill sound.</p>
<p>After tossing the scabbard far away, I got into my stance.</p>
<p>‘The sword is a bit too long for me.’</p>
<p>But that didn’t matter.</p>
<p>Cassion, who was the owner of this sword, had a much larger physique than me, so it’s only natural.</p>
<p>I kicked a few stones upward with one foot.</p>
<p>The stones were flung in the air. And before they could even fall to the floor, my body shot forward.</p>
<p>Tu-duduk.</p>
<p>The long, sharp sword split all the stones.</p>
<p>The three stones that were in the air just now soon turned into nine pieces as they met the ground.</p>
<p>And when I stepped on those small stones, they instantly turned into powder that was scattered around.</p>
<p>‘It has a good feel to it. It performs as good as it looks.’</p>
<p>After admiring it for a short moment, it was only then that I clutched it properly in my hand.</p>
<p>From now on, it was time to test the sword in earnest.</p>
<p>This whip sword.</p>
<p>This sword wasn’t just a regular longsword, but a whip sword.</p>
<p>Arm, hand, sword.</p>
<p>My energy naturally flowed like a single stream of water.</p>
<p>After being infused with qi, the slitted blade stretched silently.</p>
<p>It looked as though it had been dismantled. However.</p>
<p>The blade, which came undone along the slitted lines, had fine threads connecting them from the inside. I swung it like a whip.</p>
<p>Crackle!</p>
<p>Extended to a length more than three times my height, the sword whip struck the ground.</p>
<p>The grass that was cut rose in the air and fluttered to the ground.</p>
<p>As I swung the whip sword into the air, it smoothly reached the targeted thin tree.</p>
<p>Craaack—!</p>
<p>Again with an accompanying sharp sound, the tree snapped in half.</p>
<p>After this, I tested the whip sword more in various ways.</p>
<p>How the blades followed as I moved my body.</p>
<p>How long it would take for the whip form to return to its sword form.</p>
<p>Also, whether the whip’s length could be adjusted easily.</p>
<p>In the end, everything was satisfactory.</p>
<p>I was a little apprehensive about how the sword’s creation was finished without a single test run, but my worries ended up unfounded.</p>
<p>Swung like a whip just now, the weapon returned to the form of a long sword smoothly. As I stared at it, I murmured under my breath.</p>
<p>“Just who the hell is Blanca…”</p>
<p>Once again, I realized how fortunate it was that she was an ally.</p>
<p>‘I think I’ve checked every aspect of the sword by now…’</p>
<p>Now, it was time to check my own physical condition.</p>
<p>Even after a long time of testing the sword, I was in a better condition than I thought. My breathing was fine, too.</p>
<p>My outer strength was dreadful though, so of course it would be a joke to say that I was any sort of a ‘murim master’.</p>
<p>Still, it’s not as bad as I thought it’d be.</p>
<p>I picked up the scabbard, which I had left some distance away, and sheathed the sword and set it down. Then, I took my fan from my waist.</p>
<p>In the first place, this was my main weapon.</p>
<p>Once again, I closed my eyes and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>The body I had possessed in the second transmigration was one of the numerous children of the Baek School’s household head.</p>
<p>The Baek School was a sect led by my transcendental father, and it was located on a very rugged mountain. The mountain soared higher than the clouds, and there was a superb view of the cliffs and stone mountains surrounding the place.</p>
<p>Amid the mystical scenery, there were beautiful white petals fluttering all year round, perfectly matching the Baek School.</p>
<p>[ t/n: Baek can also mean ‘white’ ]</p>
<p>A sect led by a transcendental.</p>
<p>A perilous location.</p>
<p>White flowers that were in full bloom all year.</p>
<p>In line with such a setting, the people of the Baek household were all very austere and elegant.</p>
<p>These characteristics of theirs would become the most evident in their martial arts techniques.</p>
<p>When I was young, I learned martial arts while holding a branch of a willow tree. It was only when I grew up that I finally held a weapon and mastered those techniques.</p>
<p>In my case, it was an iron fan.</p>
<p>The teaching that could most famously sum up the Baek School was this:</p>
<p>‘Martial arts is an artform. Treat each gesture as if you would strike an orchid, as if you are drawing a line. Move in such a way that there is no way for others to distinguish whether you are dancing or practicing your martial arts.’</p>
<p>As I looked back on my memories of that time, I raised one hand.</p>
<p>Since I’m here to check my strength, I was conditioning myself with the same mindset I had in the second round.</p>
<p>The hand holding the iron fan lightly split through the air.</p>
<p>Like a butterfly’s wings.</p>
<p>Each step of mine was made carefully and delicately, as though I was running across a lake. And, my eyes were looking straight ahead.</p>
<p>I moved my hands and feet, my arms and shoulders, my legs and torso, my waist and knees. Nonstop.</p>
<p>The series of movements was like a smooth and graceful flow, splitting the air.</p>
<p>Shhhk. Shhk.</p>
<p>Of course, as my fan cut through the air, it sounded more like a snake than a butterfly.</p>
<p>As I twisted on my toes, a branch of a tree was cut down with the fan’s blade.</p>
<p>Showing a neatly sliced cross-section, the branch fell down with a snap.</p>
<p>Now imbuing my fan with inner strength, the petals and leaves that were barely formed on the thin flower tree fell off with the sound of ususu.</p>
<p>In a good mood now, I felt thrilled.</p>
<p>Right, and there lay the problem.</p>
<p>I was so exhilarated.</p>
<p>And when someone became this excited, sometimes they would become blind to their surroundings.</p>
<p>It’s called ‘carelessness’.</p>
<p>Feeling pleased, I unfolded the fan again with a clack.</p>
<p>And with my inner strength, I threw the iron fan.</p>
<p>Like a wing, it was flung and its trajectory was changed according to the direction I wanted it to go.</p>
<p>The arc I wanted it to take was behind me.</p>
<p>So, it went around my back and I waited for it to return to my hand.</p>
<p>However, the fan that was flung behind me did not come back.</p>
<p>Even though it was supposed to be here now.</p>
<p>‘Something’s off.’</p>
<p>Did I fail to control the iron fan’s arc?</p>
<p>But that couldn’t be. My movements were alright when I threw it.</p>
<p>With my brows knitted together, I slowly turned around. I had a bad feeling now, so I hesitated to look behind me.</p>
<p>Finally, as I directed my gaze in that direction, I stood still. Foolishly.</p>
<p>Because there was someone standing there.</p>
<p>Holding the fan I had thrown.</p>
<p>Feeling my throat going dry, I gulped.</p>
<p>After transmigrating as Rosetta, I now face my biggest crisis in this life.</p>
<p>I forced my thoughts to run double time, contemplating hard about what to do in this situation.</p>
<p>In the meantime, the person who saw me was the first to speak.</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>His voice was as stiff and as dry as ever, but as I saw the slight wrinkle upon his forehead, this was enough to tell me that he was not anymore calm.</p>
<p>Blinking, I forced myself to answer him.</p>
<p>“…Father.”</p>
<p>The person who saw me was none other than Rosetta’s father.</p>
<p>Duke Valentine.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was by pure happenstance that, today of all days, Duke Valentine came to this place. Ironically, it was Rosetta herself who brought upon this encounter.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago, after seeing Rosetta crying at Cassion’s funeral, Duke Valentine was left in turmoil.</p>
<p>Why. Why did her tear-stricken face overlap with that of his late wife.</p>
<p>Even weeks later, the answer to this perplexing question still eluded him.</p>
<p>The unanswerable question lingered in his mind.</p>
<p>While he was working, he would stop in a daze and recall how Rosetta cried. And even while he was eating or sleeping, Rosetta’s sobs seemed to echo in his ears.</p>
<p>And funnily enough, each and every time, the face of his late wife followed.</p>
<p>His head was about to explode.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand why he was being like this.</p>
<p>That child was not his daughter.</p>
<p>How could she be his daughter when she had been birthed by the woman who killed the love of his life?</p>
<p>And besides, that child…</p>
<p>Rosetta shared not a drop of blood with the departed Lillian.</p>
<p>But why was it that Lillian’s face kept overlapping with that child’s face?</p>
<p>At one point, a fleeting thought passed through his mind that Rosetta looked like she was a child born between Lillian and himself.</p>
<p>‘No matter how I think about it, that’s just absurd.’</p>
<p>That was impossible. It was a strange thought even to him.</p>
<p>However, as the idea had already formed, there was no way to stop it from growing.</p>
<p>After Lillian had passed away, this was the biggest emotional storm that he was experiencing.</p>
<p>Duke Valentine—Daymond Valentine—was a man of a brusque disposition, ever since he was born.</p>
<p>He was stern by nature, but it was a product of the harsh environment that had raised him.</p>
<p>It was perhaps family tradition for children of this ducal lineage to be brought with utmost coldness, and Daymond’s parents were the coldest of the Valentines.</p>
<p>He was more familiar with the words cold, logic, competition, victory and solitude rather than the words love and emotion.</p>
<p>And then he met Lillian.</p>
<p>Sometimes like the sun’s rays, sometimes like a lightning bolt. Daymond’s quiet life was changed as she caused a stir within him like so.</p>
<p>He gave his all to Lillian.</p>
<p>If she laughed, they laughed together. If she cried, then they cried together.</p>
<p>Everything she cared about, he valued as well.</p>
<p>‘But in the end, it all led to tragedy.’</p>
<p>In any case, that was what Lillian meant to Daymond.</p>
<p>Sunlight. Air. Water. Wind.</p>
<p>Everything that made up the world.</p>
<p>Of course, it was no wonder that his world became achromatic once more when she left this realm.</p>
<p>He cherished his children, but he didn’t know how he’d be able to raise them without Lillian by his side.</p>
<p>In all his life, he had always been so far detached from family, even more so than strangers.</p>
<p>And so, this led to avoidance.</p>
<p>He thought that it would be better not to see them because he couldn’t properly act like a father.</p>
<p>And whenever he saw Rosetta, his blood always ran cold. It brought him pain to stay in his own home.</p>
<p>However, this avoidance resulted in Katie’s deeds.</p>
<p>Yet again, he chose the wrong decision.</p>
<p>He should not have trusted others.</p>
<p>Katie was the one who managed the mansion’s internal affairs.</p>
<p>After spending a long time apart from his children, it had become awkward to even see each other’s faces.</p>
<p>Regardless, whether it was just giving words of consolation, or just having some casual conversation.</p>
<p>Even eating together.</p>
<p>Everything was as stiff and unfamiliar as though they were strangers.</p>
<p>But Daymond himself wasn’t fully aware of how awkward it was exactly.</p>
<p>This awkward and uncomfortable distance between the parent and his children.</p>
<p>This rational and business-like relationship.</p>
<p>When it came to the connection between parent and child, this was all he knew.</p>
<p>That’s how he was.</p>
<p>It’s been too long now to remember how he acted while Lillian was still here.</p>
<p>This heart of his was far from remembering the time when it still knew love—it had become dried up and twisted. To him, this colorless world was now filled with nothing but silence and forlorn.</p>
<p>However, his life began to be shaken up by a storm of emotions once more.</p>
<p>By none other than the remnant of the sinner who killed Lillian.</p>
<p>That sinner’s daughter, for even just a moment, felt more like Lillian’s child compared to Damian and Alicia.</p>
<p>Those weeks of turmoil and agitation finally led him to come to this place today.</p>
<p>At the end of the abandoned trail, this had been Lillian’s favorite garden.</p>
<p>After she passed away, he shed only tears of blood whenever he saw it. It had once been a secret place for only them.</p>
<p>‘Daymond! Let’s make this a place just for the two of us!’</p>
<p>‘Let’s have a small pond here, and… How about we plant some flower trees ourselves?’</p>
<p>As he walked through the thicket, Lillian’s voice followed him like an apparition.</p>
<p>So, too, followed an image of her brightly smiling face, which he had not forgotten.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 88</p>
<p>“How… long have you been here, Father?”</p>
<p>At his unexpected appearance, Rosetta struggled to move her lips and utter these words.</p>
<p>The vague expression on her face and her voice were both calm, but that was not at all the case internally.</p>
<p>‘Starting from which part did you see? Ever since I was testing out the whip sword?’</p>
<p>Rosetta was, in essence, nothing special.</p>
<p>If there’s anything about her that stood out, it was her beauty.</p>
<p>Anyone would be surprised to see her suddenly wielding a longsword freely.</p>
<p>‘People will think it’s strange, of course. The original Rosetta was…’</p>
<p>Any time of doubts being formed was exactly the thing that she feared and loathed the most.</p>
<p>Unlike Rosetta, who was agonizing inwardly, the duke just continued to stare at her without a word.</p>
<p>The longer the silence went on, the greater Rosetta’s anxiety grew.</p>
<p>She needed to know from which part he started watching so that she could think of a proper excuse.</p>
<p>However, contrary to her concerns, it fortunately hadn’t been long since the duke arrived.</p>
<p>It was shortly after Rosetta had cut the grass with her fan.</p>
<p>By the time the duke arrived at this place, he came to a halt at the edge of the clearing and hid his presence. He couldn’t help but admire Rosetta’s display of martial arts.</p>
<p>Of course, this also meant that he saw how Rosetta cut down the branch, how she scattered the petals, and how she imbued her fan with inner strength and sent it flying.</p>
<p>Luckily however, the duke right now was completely out of sorts.</p>
<p>His mind was preoccupied with remembering Lillian again after he saw Rosetta moving lithely as though she was dancing.</p>
<p>While she was still alive, Lillian used to come here and dance as well. Just like this, even without a song.</p>
<p>If anything, what served as a music box was the occasional sound of nature coming from the surrounding forest.</p>
<p>And here, the unrestrained smile that was on her face as she danced freely was ever so beautiful.</p>
<p>It was so beautiful that he watched with rapt attention.</p>
<p>Here, the martial arts displayed before him was entirely far removed from the way that an aristocrat should move, but the only people here were the two of them, and so there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Old, rigid rules. The manner in which an aristocrat must act. Etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p>Everything that was tirelessly drilled and forced upon them served no use in a place like this where there were no rules.</p>
<p>As Lillian’s image overlapped with Rosetta once more, the duke was stunned.</p>
<p>Again. Again.</p>
<p>That child reminded him of Lillian again. As though he was reminiscing about the past from a child who resembled her parents.</p>
<p>The duke lowered his gaze and stared at the fan in his hand.</p>
<p>“…You can perform unusual martial arts with a fan, I see.”</p>
<p>The duke finally spoke, but he was still focused on the fan as he was trying to erase Lillian’s memory.</p>
<p>It was a thoughtless comment uttered to avoid revealing his innermost thoughts, but hearing this made Rosetta deeply relieved.</p>
<p>‘Since you’re not talking about the sword right away, I guess you didn’t see the whip sword.’</p>
<p>If he saw her wielding it earlier, that would have been the first question he asked.</p>
<p>People wouldn’t normally question the fan first.</p>
<p>‘I mean, I did this and that with my fan…’</p>
<p>She cut a branch, scattered petals and shot the fan through the air like a boomerang.</p>
<p>Still, rather than having seen her swordsmanship in earnest, this was more bearable.</p>
<p>Wasn’t this at least better than the worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>Feeling more relieved now, Rosetta smiled softly.</p>
<p>“You saw that, Father? That’s a bit embarrassing. I was just practicing what I learned from Maxwell. He taught me how to use that fan so I can protect myself.”</p>
<p>“That guy?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Maxwell also gave me that fan.”</p>
<p>In response to what she said, the duke’s gaze gravitated back to the fan.</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like an ordinary fan used when going to high society events, but it was quite heavy and hard to the touch. It seemed like it was inlaid with metal.</p>
<p>The edge of the fan also looked dull, but it was in fact sharp. If it was wielded with force, it’s possible to cut something with this.</p>
<p>As he examined the fan further, Rosetta naturally added another excuse.</p>
<p>“It’s a self-defense fan. I guess it’s something popular among commoners.”</p>
<p>From time to time, what’s popular among commoners would appear amidst the nobles. Once they’d hear from where it became popular, they would kick up a fuss</p>
<p>While commenting on how undignified it was for a noble to use something of a peasant’s.</p>
<p>However, Rosetta knew that the duke wasn’t that kind of person, so she brought it up without worrying.</p>
<p>The Duke Valentine that she knew was someone who didn’t care about such things. As long as it’s practical, it didn’t matter whether it was a commoner’s possession or a noble’s valuable.</p>
<p>The duke did not answer.</p>
<p>Even when he tried to focus only on the fan, Lillian kept coming to his mind.</p>
<p>Once again, his tangled thoughts began to slip through.</p>
<p>‘Seems like he’s kind of out of it.’</p>
<p>The duke’s gold eyes were as cold as they always were, but his gaze felt hollow.</p>
<p>‘Well, I don’t know why you’re out of it right now, but…’</p>
<p>This was good for Rosetta.</p>
<p>It’s easy to trick someone who’s absent-minded.</p>
<p>The duke soon opened his lips to speak.</p>
<p>“The energy imbued into the fan is unusual. It doesn’t feel like aura, but did that guy teach you this as well?”</p>
<p>Contrary to Rosetta’s thoughts however, the supposedly absent-minded duke asked a very astute question.</p>
<p>Even so, Rosetta shook her head. Not a sign of agitation could be gleaned from her countenance.</p>
<p>Her wide, round eyes looked innocent, as though she really knew nothing.</p>
<p>Blinking her widened eyes, she asked carefully.</p>
<p>“Unusual energy? What kind of energy?”</p>
<p>As Rosetta asked back and feigned ignorance, the duke stared at her.</p>
<p>Even at the end of that gaze, Rosetta did not break character.</p>
<p>“What kind of energy is coming from me? Or, I guess maybe the fan is just special…”</p>
<p>If she said she didn’t know, what more could she be asked?</p>
<p>The duke did not ask any further questions. Wordlessly, he walked into the garden.</p>
<p>Once he stepped into this place that was full of memories, nostalgia of the past enveloped him completely.</p>
<p>With an apathetic expression, the duke held out the fan.</p>
<p>Rosetta took the fan and bowed her head to him.</p>
<p>They acted so awkwardly that it’s impossible to view as having a father-daughter relationship.</p>
<p>“Truthfully, I think I put in too much energy that the fan flew away like that. I didn’t know where it went and I got a bit flustered, but it turns out that it went straight to you, Father… I’m so sorry.”</p>
<p>Rosetta fiddled with the fan as she apologized, but in turn, the duke just shook his head.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing for you to apologize for. I’m the one who didn’t make my presence known.”</p>
<p>“Thank you very much for understanding.”</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled faintly and bowed her head again.</p>
<p>Then, silence.</p>
<p>There was nothing more for them to talk about, so silence naturally took precedence.</p>
<p>All Rosetta wanted was to leave as soon as she could, but she didn’t quite know how she should excuse herself.</p>
<p>The two of them really had nothing more to say to each other, but they were just standing there as though they wanted to say something.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as Rosetta remained in front of him, the duke’s eyes wandered elsewhere.</p>
<p>Towards the viridescent expanse.</p>
<p>Where flowers bloomed here and there.</p>
<p>And with blossoms surrounding it, there lay a pond that seemed to contain the blue sky within it.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he realized one strange thing.</p>
<p>Everything here looked well-maintained.</p>
<p>The grass was cut and the pond was clean.</p>
<p>After Lillian passed away, Daymond did not dare come to this place.</p>
<p>A place that was too precious to one’s heart would sometimes become poisonous.</p>
<p>Still, he didn’t want to leave it to someone else to maintain it.</p>
<p>This was a place reserved only for Lillian and Daymond, and as such, only the two of them had managed it before.</p>
<p>They were planning to tell their children about this place once they grew up.</p>
<p>Still, for him to leave this place to someone else’s hands in the meantime?</p>
<p>That’s absurd.</p>
<p>It might be nothing but foolish selfishness on his part, but he wanted to preserve this place in memory of the time that he and Lillian spent together.</p>
<p>In the end, it was neglected.</p>
<p>He had no courage to come back here, and neither was he willing to leave someone else in charge of it.</p>
<p>It was laughable.</p>
<p>Supposedly to protect his memories of this place, he instead chose to neglect it.</p>
<p>Even so, he thought that this was the best option that he could take.</p>
<p>Without Lillian, it was no longer a meaningful place anyway.</p>
<p>It would hurt less to let it stay buried as a beautiful, distant memory.</p>
<p>His reluctance to come back to this place had already faded years before.</p>
<p>He did not actively look for this place again because he didn’t want to see it ruined by many years of neglect.</p>
<p>However, when he was wracked with disquiet recently, he eventually sought out this place.</p>
<p>He had to muster some determination before coming here.</p>
<p>Anything that’s been neglected for such a long time would obviously be in such disarray.</p>
<p>That’s definitely what he thought so as he walked along the faded trail.</p>
<p>However, when he arrived, the garden looked the same as ever from his memories.</p>
<p>It was far from a mess.</p>
<p>It looked as if someone had been taking good care of it all this time.</p>
<p>He looked around in a daze, then he turned back to the person standing before him—towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>Towards the trespasser, who he believed brought life back to this place.</p>
<p>“Have you been taking care of this place?”</p>
<p>Rosetta hesitated, but she soon nodded in response to the duke’s question.</p>
<p>Rather than telling a vague lie, this was better.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. I found this place by chance and I came to like it, so I wished to come here often.”</p>
<p>But Father, how did you find this place…</p>
<p>The following question was timidly added.</p>
<p>It was evidently an abandoned place, and there was no sign of anyone ever coming by here…</p>
<p>That’s why the last thing she could have imagined was for the duke to come to such a place.</p>
<p>The duke’s gaze faintly observed Rosetta.</p>
<p>The gold eyes that resembled his suddenly caught his attention.</p>
<p>Those eyes meant that she was a Valentine both in name and in truth.</p>
<p>Those eyes were his, and her nose looked like Lillian’s…</p>
<p>No. It can’t be.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand why he was trying to look for features that might resemble Lillian in her.</p>
<p>This child was not his.</p>
<p>This child…</p>
<p>This child had the blood of the sinner who killed Lillian.</p>
<p>Trying to push down the chaos surging within him, he answered belatedly.</p>
<p>“While she was still alive, this was Lillian’s favorite place.”</p>
<p>And his voice was as cold as the expression upon his face.</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>
<p>Rosetta bowed, letting out a small sigh under her breath.</p>
<p>On the outside, her demeanor could be interpreted as her being apologetic about a wrongdoing that she had committed. However, inwardly, she had only one thought in mind.</p>
<p>Ha. No wonder it felt like everything’s going too smoothly today.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 89</p>
<p>Lillian.</p>
<p>According to Rosetta’s memories, ‘Lillian’ was the name of the late duchess.</p>
<p>And the Duke loved Lillian dearly.</p>
<p>‘Of course, it seems like he still loves her until now.’</p>
<p>Anyway, this garden was a place that his wife had loved very much while she was still alive, and yet the daughter of the sinner who killed his wife was here right now.</p>
<p>Right now, well, it definitely looked like she was picking a fight.</p>
<p>Rosetta bit her chapped lips and carefully picked her words.</p>
<p>“I apologize, Father. I didn’t know. If I knew that this was a special place, I wouldn’t have come. I really do apologize.”</p>
<p>In essence, the sooner you say sorry, the better.</p>
<p>It’s better to apologize right away rather than aggravating your sin by making futile excuses here and there.</p>
<p>At least, that’s the best method when faced with Duke Valentine.</p>
<p>He listened to Rosetta’s apology without interrupting her, then after she was done, he finally opened his lips.</p>
<p>“Since you…”</p>
<p>His lips opened only a fraction, then closed again after saying only the start.</p>
<p>Since you were the one who maintained it, you can just come whenever you want.</p>
<p>The words that he couldn’t utter vanished from his mouth.</p>
<p>These words almost left his lips without him realizing it, and it was obvious that he would have regretted saying it if he really did say it.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe he almost allowed someone to come and go freely in a place where he and Lillian’s memories remained.</p>
<p>And it was this child, no less.</p>
<p>Did that even make any sense?</p>
<p>As the duke was in a dilemma over what to say, Rosetta’s brows knitted together as she was confused.</p>
<p>But that was all.</p>
<p>She didn’t even want to know what kind of answer he was going to give her.</p>
<p>Now that she knew this wasn’t just some other ordinary place, the only goal she had in mind now was this—she needed to get out of here immediately.</p>
<p>At this time, she knew that the conversation was over.</p>
<p>‘I’m a bit flustered though that you talked to me this much.’</p>
<p>Since the conversation was now over, it wouldn’t be rude for her to ask permission to go first.</p>
<p>Rosetta gently picked up the sword that was on the ground.</p>
<p>Snapping out of his reverie, the duke’s gaze silently followed Rosetta’s movements.</p>
<p>Their eyes met for a quick second, but she lowered her head.</p>
<p>“Father, I’ll be off first. Please take your time and look around as you please.”</p>
<p>And just as she predicted, the duke didn’t stop Rosetta from leaving.</p>
<p>He just stared at her without saying anything, only nodding once to give his permission.</p>
<p>Rosetta quietly headed towards the path.</p>
<p>She was already at the border between the path and the entrance of the garden, but she halted in place.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>It’s because there’s something that suddenly came to her mind when she realized that the duke talked to her a lot here.</p>
<p>The face that popped into her mind was Alicia’s.</p>
<p>It was that somewhat affectionate and somewhat sorrowful expression on her face as they were taking a stroll in the garden before.</p>
<p>This was what she said.</p>
<p>‘I do see Brother often when he’s at home, but it’s difficult to see Father even when he’s back from work. We don’t talk a lot either… It’s a shame.’</p>
<p>“Father.”</p>
<p>Rosetta, who was far away now, turned around to face her father again, calling him briefly.</p>
<p>The duke blinked dazedly from behind her.</p>
<p>This seemed to be enough of an answer, silent as it might be. So, Rosetta continued speaking without waiting for him to do so first.</p>
<p>“If you show this place to Alicia, I think she’ll be very happy.”</p>
<p>“To Alicia?”</p>
<p>The way he asked back was reminiscent of a child who didn’t understand anything.</p>
<p>If he’d show this place to Alicia, she’d be happy?</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>At his question, which genuinely sounded like he’s seeking an answer he didn’t know, Rosetta shrugged once and replied.</p>
<p>“Alicia is always so happy whenever you talk to her, Father. So if you tell her stories about Mother… I mean, Her Grace the Duchess, then I believe that she’ll be very happy.”</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled ambiguously as Alicia came to mind.</p>
<p>Already, she could imagine Alicia jumping for joy.</p>
<p>This could only be possible if the duke would assent to it, of course.</p>
<p>However, the duke just stared blankly at Rosetta.</p>
<p>Somehow, as a gentle breeze blew past, Lillian’s voice overlapped.</p>
<p>‘Please be a kind figure to the children. See them often, laugh together, show them good places, tell them stories, and listen to them, too. That will make you a great father.’</p>
<p>You have nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Towards him, who was afraid that he couldn’t be a proper father to their children, these were Lillian’s comforting whispers.</p>
<p>Today was the first time he realized that Alicia would be happy if he would have a conversation with her.</p>
<p>He thought that she would be uncomfortable with him because he was stern even when she greeted him occasionally.</p>
<p>That’s why he didn’t say much on purpose…</p>
<p>“You.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>Rosetta was surprised to hear an abrupt call like this instead of an answer.</p>
<p>At first, the duke seemed to be hesitating over what he was about to say, but he then spoke coldly.</p>
<p>“What do you like.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Rosetta thought that she might be hearing an auditory hallucination.</p>
<p>If not that, then she felt a bit compelled to ask the duke if he was sick or something.</p>
<p>It was the first ever time that he was asking such a question.</p>
<p>She wasn’t just talking about after she possessed this body. Even if she scanned all of the original Rosetta’s memories, there was never a time that he ever asked a question like that.</p>
<p>But now, as if he was about to accept Rosetta, with a question like this…</p>
<p>Rosetta briefly considered what to answer, but her contemplation ended soon.</p>
<p>Instead of responding to that question, she shook her head.</p>
<p>“There’s no need for you to ask me that.”</p>
<p>At first glance, it looked like the smile on her lips was tinged by a sneer.</p>
<p>Of course, any hint of it was so faint that anyone looking at her wouldn’t have noticed it.</p>
<p>Rosetta was exceptionally uncomfortable with the duke’s attention.</p>
<p>She thought that it would be comfortable and pleasant if they could just maintain the kind of relationship, or lack thereof, that strangers had.</p>
<p>Just give what you want to give, receive what you want to receive.</p>
<p>Besides that, it’s laughable that he was asking this question for the first time towards someone who was now nearly an adult.</p>
<p>It’s not as if they should start pretending to be a parent and his child now.</p>
<p>It could be said that she was exaggerating a bit here, but anything that might cause her anxiety later should just be nipped at the bud.</p>
<p>She wasn’t even the real Rosetta.</p>
<p>Any attention from him would just be unnecessary and troublesome to deal with.</p>
<p>‘Of course, I do still want you to start paying more attention to Alicia and act like her father now.’</p>
<p>But still, not with her.</p>
<p>His changed behavior was like Damian’s.</p>
<p>As if something—perhaps a thorn—was lodged at his throat.</p>
<p>One such person was enough.</p>
<p>“I am thankful enough that you have graciously brought me up until now. I know my place.”</p>
<p>Don’t worry. I won’t try to steal even a minuscule fraction of Alicia’s share.</p>
<p>Curtsying once more, Rosetta bowed her head towards him with a smile on her lips.</p>
<p>How she looked now was even more formal and distant compared to the way she regarded him earlier.</p>
<p>And without saying anything more, Rosetta turned around.</p>
<p>She was very impatient to leave that secret garden and trudge down the trail once more.</p>
<p>To the extent that she looked as if she was running away.</p>
<p>The duke could only stand there, motionless, as he watched Rosetta’s retreating figure.</p>
<p>Yet again, the voice whispered from behind him.</p>
<p>‘You’re not allowed to raise Rosetta to become a person who constantly walks on eggshells. Okay?’</p>
<p>And here, he realized that there had been not a single promise that he kept.</p>
<p>He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Standing there for a long time, it felt as if he was back in the past.</p>
<p>The wind swept past the leaves, rustling them every so often. It felt like the sound of Lillian rebuking him for his actions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“What is… this?”</p>
<p>“Your sword.”</p>
<p>“My sword?”</p>
<p>Holding the long sword in his hands, Cassion asked back in surprise.</p>
<p>When told that this was his sword, he just blinked as though he couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>I’m very pleased.</p>
<p>Right, since it’s a surprise gift, this much of a reaction should come up.</p>
<p>I had to go through something like that incident two days ago while testing the sword, but it didn’t feel unfair anymore since Cassion’s reaction was good.</p>
<p>A couple of days ago, after meeting the duke unexpectedly in that place, I escaped from there as though I was running away. I went straight to my room.</p>
<p>It’s been a while since I pushed myself like that, even if all I did was cut some grass in that garden, but my tiredness was more of a byproduct of the incident with the duke rather than my physical exertion.</p>
<p>‘Let’s just rest.’</p>
<p>And so, after I made up her mind, I really did just rest.</p>
<p>The next day, I talked to Blanca again through the crystal ball.</p>
<p>After I told her that the sword was excellent, Blanca nodded.</p>
<p>Though, instead of being happy with the feedback, she seemed to have taken it as a natural evaluation.</p>
<p>Then, on the evening of the same day, I promised to have dinner with Alicia, so I had to postpone giving the sword to Cassion for another time.</p>
<p>And that’s today.</p>
<p>Finally, Cassion’s whip sword found its way to its master.</p>
<p>“My sword…”</p>
<p>After I gave the sword over to him, Cassion carefully swept one hand over it.</p>
<p>His dark eyes were emotional.</p>
<p>He wasn’t a knight but a mage, but he seemed to be very happy to receive this sword. After all, he’s been living as a knight for months now.</p>
<p>“You have a sword now, Sir Maxwell. Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Lady Rosetta invented that sword herself.”</p>
<p>Facing the emotional Cassion, Diana and Logan each said one thing.</p>
<p>Cassion smiled in gratitude after hearing Diana’s words first, then after hearing what Logan said next, he turned to me in amazement.</p>
<p>“You did?”</p>
<p>He stared back at me as though he couldn’t quite believe it. At his question, I nodded.</p>
<p>‘It’s not completely my own personal invention though.’</p>
<p>Still, I would be the first person in this world to have come up with the design of a whip sword, so it’s not completely wrong to say I invented it.</p>
<p>Unnecessary humility isn’t my style.</p>
<p>“Yes, and that’s why this is the only sword of its kind in the world. It’s a sword that no one else can try to imitate.”</p>
<p>The only one in the world.</p>
<p>And it’s all yours.</p>
<p>After I added those last two things quietly, Cassion just looked at me in a daze.</p>
<p>His silent lips seemed to be murmuring the words ‘only one’ and ‘mine’.</p>
<p>“Thank you. It’s a truly special sword.”</p>
<p>“Right? Try it out once.”</p>
<p>At my suggestion, Cassion nodded. As he took a deep breath, his tense fingers gripped the hilt and pulled it out of its scabbard.</p>
<p>Shiiing.</p>
<p>And as he unsheathed it, the sword’s unique sound greeted him.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 90</p>
<p>“Wow, it even sounds different?”</p>
<p>With Diana commenting from the side, Logan also opened his lips as though to reply.</p>
<p>“I heard that the Madam entrusted this request to the most reputable bladesmith she knew because it was difficult making a unique sword.”</p>
<p>“Unique sword?”</p>
<p>At Logan’s response, Cassion asked back. However, Logan looked towards me instead of answering.</p>
<p>He was giving me the opportunity to answer.</p>
<p>So, following Logan’s gesture, Cassion faced me as well.</p>
<p>“What does that mean? Is this a unique sword?”</p>
<p>“Quite, yes.”</p>
<p>I reached forward and pointed at the flat side of the whip sword’s blade. In turn, Cassion extended his own arms to bring the sword closer to me so I could point more easily.</p>
<p>Thanks to his thoughtfulness, I was able to point out the lines on the blade precisely.</p>
<p>“These here, do you see the fine lines?”</p>
<p>With his gaze following my finger, he nodded.</p>
<p>“I see them, it’s not just a couple.”</p>
<p>“There are exactly fifty-five of them.”</p>
<p>As I mentioned the exact number, Cassion tilted his head to the side.</p>
<p>“Fifty-five? But what are these lines for?”</p>
<p>Outwardly, the lines looked like a simple, engraved pattern.</p>
<p>Indeed, I’m sure he wouldn’t be able to imagine that this was actually a whip sword.</p>
<p>“What do you think they’re for?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, I went around behind him. Now standing a short distance away, Cassion watched what I was doing.</p>
<p>When I stepped behind him, he turned his head as his eyes followed me.</p>
<p>Standing behind him, I immediately reached out to put my arms around him. What met my arms was a wooden body that had become frozen.</p>
<p>Even so, this small Rosetta couldn’t embrace him fully.</p>
<p>He was too bulky for that.</p>
<p>At the sudden back hug position, Cassion stopped breathing right then.</p>
<p>Even through his clothes, his muscles one by one grew so obviously stiff, making me laugh.</p>
<p>“It could be dangerous, so you two should move elsewhere. Ah, you can go sit over there.”</p>
<p>Gesturing with my chin, I pointed out the tea table and chairs beneath a tree’s shade.</p>
<p>That’s where I spent most of the time whenever I came here, just sitting.</p>
<p>Although I sometimes helped Cassion train, I usually left the matter to these three people and just watched.</p>
<p>But those two would be just spectators today.</p>
<p>They’re both seeing a whip sword for the first time ever, so for today’s training, I was completely in charge.</p>
<p>After confirming that the two were seated, I focused on Cassion again.</p>
<p>“You remember all your training, right?”</p>
<p>“Do you mean the mage knight fighting style?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that. Using this sword will make that fighting style show its true worth.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean…”</p>
<p>“Shh, quiet now. Just leave it to me and see.”</p>
<p>I cut off Cassion’s question and grinned.</p>
<p>He was visibly perplexed as he looked back at me, but he soon averted his gaze without another word.</p>
<p>Contrary to that seemingly nonchalant action, the back of his neck and his ears were red.</p>
<p>I held back my laughter this time and began explaining.</p>
<p>“Whenever you use your body’s energy, your efficiency depends on how well you’re able to circulate it. The best way to do this is to emulate the flow of water.”</p>
<p>While I said this, I placed my right arm close to Cassion’s own right arm.</p>
<p>After pulling our shoulders, arms and wrists as close as possible, I wrapped my hand over the man’s hand that was holding the sword.</p>
<p>The frozen man’s fingertips flinched for a moment.</p>
<p>With my other hand, I rummaged through my pocket and pulled out a small piece of cloth.</p>
<p>This small piece of cloth was thin to the point that it was almost see-through, and I placed it between our shoulders.</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“I can feel your mana, but you can’t feel the energy circulating in my body. That’s why this one way of letting you sense it.”</p>
<p>I can sense Cassion’s mana, but Cassion can’t sense my qi.</p>
<p>So, I needed a medium that would allow him to sense it, at least by touch.</p>
<p>And that medium was this.</p>
<p>A small piece of cloth.</p>
<p>“Now then, try observing the cloth’s movement. Shoulder to arm. And from arm to wrist.”</p>
<p>The small cloth moved according to the slow recitation of its direction.</p>
<p>Every time these body parts were mentioned, the cloth gently slid down over my arm.</p>
<p>“Wrist to palm. Palm to fingers.”</p>
<p>And then, the sword.</p>
<p>At the same time these last words were murmured, the cloth moved over to the sword and was split into two as it fell upon the sharp blade.</p>
<p>Like a withering flower petal, it fluttered downward.</p>
<p>“What do you think? Do you understand?”</p>
<p>At the energetic questions, Cassion turned his head.</p>
<p>Both confusion and enlightenment could be seen reasonably mixed in that nearby gaze.</p>
<p>Anyhow, this method seemed effective.</p>
<p>With my empty hand, I pushed Cassion’s check.</p>
<p>He faced forward again without any resistance.</p>
<p>“Try it once. So we can see.”</p>
<p>“While staying like this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I need to see if your mana is flowing properly.”</p>
<p>“…Well, I guess.”</p>
<p>While Cassion agreed indifferently, he let out a somewhat breathless exhale.</p>
<p>It sounded a bit rough, as though his breath got hitched.</p>
<p>Glancing up to see his side profile, I saw him close his eyes.</p>
<p>With his features unmoving, he looked like he was concentrating. Then, he slowly opened his eyes.</p>
<p>Soon, a unique energy could be felt around his chest.</p>
<p>Mana began to flow out of Cassion’s heart.</p>
<p>Starting from his heart, his mana slowly flowed towards his shoulder.</p>
<p>“It’s a bit stiff. Try to shape it more like a fish swimming in water.”</p>
<p>The focused Cassion couldn’t answer and instead let out a gruff breath. He seemed to be trying to relax his frozen body, even if it was by force.</p>
<p>Soon, the energy hovering around his shoulder began to flow down his arm.</p>
<p>It was softer now compared to how it was just a second ago.</p>
<p>“Alright, slower now. And more carefully. You have to be careful with a whip sword while getting used to it.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, it wouldn’t listen to you.</p>
<p>It must have been strange to hear that, but his concentration did not break.</p>
<p>This time again, Cassion moved his mana instead of opening his lips.</p>
<p>The slender flow of mana moved from his arm, down his wrist, towards his palm and then his fingers.</p>
<p>And finally, it flowed down to the sword.</p>
<p>At the same time, the whip sword revealed its true form.</p>
<p>Shwa-rak.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a very noticeable sound, but as soon as this was heard, the sword’s form changed at once. From a longsword, it stretched outward.</p>
<p>Half of it was still in the form of a longsword, while the other half from the tip was in the form of a whip.</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness.”</p>
<p>“What a truly marvelous invention.”</p>
<p>In the distance, Diana and Logan couldn’t help but react in this way.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just the two of them who were shocked.</p>
<p>“What…”</p>
<p>As he suddenly found himself in this situation, his concentration broke.</p>
<p>When his focus unraveled like that, some of his mana returned to his heart.</p>
<p>Chaaang!</p>
<p>At the same time, the sword returned to its original form with a loud sound.</p>
<p>The drooping half turned back into the end of a longsword.</p>
<p>The sword’s screech was so loud that both Diana and Logan got surprised and jumped up from their seats.</p>
<p>“Urk.”</p>
<p>Cassion groaned because the rebound was as loud as that screech.</p>
<p>He looked back towards me with his brows wrinkled in distress.</p>
<p>“Are you alright?”</p>
<p>Who’s asking who here?</p>
<p>Hearing my question be taken away from me, I shrugged.</p>
<p>I’m fine.</p>
<p>I feel no pain.</p>
<p>It was thanks to the fact that I had prepared for this earlier. I already knew that it might turn out like this.</p>
<p>“I’m alright. Besides that, do you understand now? This is what happens when your concentration breaks.”</p>
<p>When I replied calmly, Cassion smirked.</p>
<p>“…If I had known in advance that this sword would change like that, I wouldn’t have gotten distracted.”</p>
<p>His voice was tinged with an empty laugh as he said something very reasonable.</p>
<p>But then, what to do? Telling you about it would ruin the fun of it.</p>
<p>“A surprise gift should remain a surprise until it’s revealed, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>This time, there was no more empty laughter.</p>
<p>After the small hiccup at the start, his training continued without a hitch.</p>
<p>He was successful in turning a regular sword into a mana sword in this way, but this was of course not like any other sword.</p>
<p>Since it’s a new one, he’d need to learn how to use it accordingly.</p>
<p>Just as a head would need to bear the weight of a crown that it might wear, a person who would wield a weapon as unique as this would have to go through certain hardships to master it.</p>
<p>His training started around noon, but it did not stop until the sun went past the center of the sky and started to paint the sky red.</p>
<p>It would take up too much time to stop for a full meal, so Diana brought over some sandwiches for us to eat here.</p>
<p>After the short dinner, training resumed once again.</p>
<p>Though they were just watching at the sidelines, Logan and Diana were also part of this training session.</p>
<p>The two of them were mainly in charge of Cassion’s training as a whole, so they needed to be here to observe how the whip sword is wielded so that they could supplement their lessons later.</p>
<p>I won’t be able to help him train every day.</p>
<p>The two of them watched us seriously the entire time, and they also often exchanged a few words in between.</p>
<p>When I focused my senses on trying to listen, I heard that they were discussing how they could help further reinforce Cassion’s swordsmanship and magic.</p>
<p>The long training session ended just before Cassion collapsed to the ground, fully soaked in sweat.</p>
<p>Cassion kept muttering that he couldn’t go on anymore, but I lightly dismissed those earlier.</p>
<p>Still, I’m just training him—I don’t mean to make him lie bedridden again.</p>
<p>Cha-rarang.</p>
<p>Along with that distinct sound, the whip sword in his hand returned to the form of a longsword.</p>
<p>As soon as the sword was sheathed, his legs barely held on but soon staggered, and his body started falling to the ground.</p>
<p>I supported the falling man and carefully laid him down.</p>
<p>I asked Diana to bring some water, then I asked Logan to get the first aid kit.</p>
<p>When they left at the same time, only the two of us were left in this spacious clearing.</p>
<p>Grasshoppers cried out in the distance.</p>
<p>Right now, the late summer night felt like it was that of the early autumn.</p>
<p>The days were still of the summer, while the nights were already the autumn’s.</p>
<p>Today was a very tiring day.</p>
<p>I crouched down next to the collapsed Cassion.</p>
<p>With my chin resting on my knees, I stared at him as he tried to catch his breath.</p>
<p>His chest moved up and down, moving to the beat of his gasping breaths.</p>
<p>“How was it? Seems like you can do it now, right?”</p>
<p>At the quietly murmured questions, Cassion struggled to open his eyes.</p>
<p>He stared back at me for a long time, though he closed his eyes as though they were very heavy.</p>
<p>While closing his eyes now, the corners of his lips slowly tugged up to form an arc.</p>
<p>“Haa… Ha… Yeah. It kind of feels— like I’m worthy now. Right?”</p>
<p>He uttered his reply while panting, and I chuckled.</p>
<p>Cassion’s response exuded double the usual enthusiasm.</p>
<p>That’s right. He was worthy now. Even when it came to wielding the whip sword.</p>
<p>And, he was a worthy rival to Leo now.</p>
<p>This minor villain, who was once not worthy enough to dare stand as an opponent against the male lead, gritted his teeth and clawed his way to this position.</p>
<p>This man, who was once being chased by death itself, could now proudly aim to become the head of a duchy.</p>
<p>In the past, people would have derided him for coveting the duke’s seat, but now…</p>
<p>Now, those people would mutter under their breaths, ‘Cassion could actually become the duke.’</p>
<p>That’s right. Now, he was one step higher in terms of being a ‘rival’.</p>
<p>With a smile on my lips, I raised my head.</p>
<p>The bright red sun had since set, and the moon had taken its place in the night sky.</p>
<p>There, the full, golden moon showcased its splendid illumination across the dark expanse.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 91</p>
<p>Time flew by like an arrow, and soon enough, the hunting festival was just around the corner.</p>
<p>The summer heat also gradually subsided, and in the same way, the sun rose high.</p>
<p>Autumn was almost here.</p>
<p>Fortunately in the meantime, Cassion adapted to the whip sword.</p>
<p>His technique wasn’t perfect yet, but he could handle it adeptly already.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had formed a connection with the whip sword, but he adapted faster to it compared to a regular sword.</p>
<p>His skills were improving fast.</p>
<p>What a relief.</p>
<p>Then, there was one other fortunate thing.</p>
<p>After meeting the duke in the late duchess’ garden the other day, I was afraid that he would start talking to me more and giving me more attention, but luckily, there’s no sign of that happening.</p>
<p>We crossed paths sometimes, and we would just exchange brief greetings.</p>
<p>Our relationship was still nothing more than that.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, I heard something unbelievable from Alicia.</p>
<p>‘Sister, you know, Father showed me Mother’s garden. We had a short conversation, too! Let’s go together next time!’</p>
<p>That last thing she said would never happen, but I just nodded anyway.</p>
<p>Alicia was so thrilled and happy at that moment, so I couldn’t possibly pour cold water over her.</p>
<p>But really, it was quite unexpected.</p>
<p>I just told him to take care of Alicia as an afterthought, but honestly, I wasn’t expecting much from him.</p>
<p>He had that kind of personality, so I would never have imagined him to listen to my words.</p>
<p>‘No, in the first place, it’s unbelievable enough that he heard me out.’</p>
<p>I was alone while thinking of this and that, but I soon heard two raps on the door.</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>“Milady, it’s me. There’s a letter for you.”</p>
<p>The owner of that voice was Diana.</p>
<p>Even though I told her she didn’t have to knock, she still continued to do so.</p>
<p>Turning away from the sky outside the window, I set my gaze on the door.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>After my quiet permission had been given, the door opened.</p>
<p>Then, Diana entered the room, bringing with her a silver tray with a letter on it.</p>
<p>“Here it is, Milady.”</p>
<p>“Who is it from?”</p>
<p>“One is from Young Duke Daniel Freesia, another is from…”</p>
<p>Diana trailed off, her expression becoming stiff.</p>
<p>Her bright brown eyes turned to me.</p>
<p>As though just saying the sender’s name aloud would be poisonous.</p>
<p>I took the two letters that Diana handed to me and carefully looked at them. The letters were sealed with the coat of arms of two different households, and the white and red envelopes were respectively,</p>
<p>House Freesia.</p>
<p>And House Carter.</p>
<p>Just as Diana said, the first was sent by Daniel. While the other one was sent by…</p>
<p>“Leo Carter.”</p>
<p>It was from him.</p>
<p>As I leaned back on my seat, Diana stared at the red envelope and opened her lips, the corners of which were turned down.</p>
<p>“Why on earth did he send a letter?”</p>
<p>Diana was one of the few who knew the true relationship between Cassion and Leo.</p>
<p>She has been Cassion’s teacher for the past few months, so it seemed like she didn’t want Leo to come anywhere close to Cassion.</p>
<p>Well, maybe it’s because I hated the guy, that’s why she also started loathing him.</p>
<p>I pressed the red envelope down with my fingernails.</p>
<p>And one by one, crescent moons were etched into the spots where the envelope was pressed on.</p>
<p>“I’m not so sure. I felt relieved by the fact that I haven’t received any letters from him all this time, but…”</p>
<p>I even felt a little optimistic as I thought, ‘Maybe he forgot about me?’</p>
<p>As for Daniel, on the other hand, it wasn’t the first time he had sent a letter. After the day we met, he started sending letters and contacted me often.</p>
<p>Even though the contents of his letters were nothing special.</p>
<p>In any case, unlike Daniel, this was the first time Leo had sent a letter.</p>
<p>I thought that he would send one right away since he was the one who wanted to keep in touch with me.</p>
<p>Grimly, I clutched the letter. It was only after the red envelope was full of crescent moons that I reached for a letter opener.</p>
<p>Riiip—</p>
<p>The letter opener ripped into the top of the envelope with a corresponding sound.</p>
<p>Unlike the very saturated red envelope, the letter inside was written on plain white paper.</p>
<p>“Dear Lady Rosetta Valentine,”</p>
<p>I muttered the common salutation.</p>
<p>His handwriting was neat and sophisticated. Very characteristic of a male lead.</p>
<p>The contents, however, were nothing out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>‘I apologize for not writing to you sooner.</p>
<p>More than I initially expected, I was left in shock after my older brother’s passing.</p>
<p>It was a struggle to pull myself together, and I also had to take care of my grieving mother, so I had been left with no time to write to you.</p>
<p>The hunting festival is drawing near, so let us meet once more there.</p>
<p>Then, I will be looking forward to seeing you at the hunting festival.’</p>
<p>That’s about it.</p>
<p>At first glance, it was an exceptionally ordinary letter, but I couldn’t stop my brows from furrowing as I read through it.</p>
<p>Only the surface was ordinary. Counting from one to ten, everything written here were lies.</p>
<p>‘Pull yourself together? Grieving?’</p>
<p>Laughable, really.</p>
<p>For a murderer to grieve over the death of the man they killed.</p>
<p>‘You’re busy not because you’re grieving, but because you’ve started scheming again.’</p>
<p>Just as he mentioned, the hunting festival was almost here, and so he’s definitely plotting some sort of incident that would happen on that day.</p>
<p>I could already predict what kind of ‘trick’ he’d be pulling on the hunting festival thanks to my knowledge of the original novel.</p>
<p>However, aside from all that, there was one small thing that’s bothering me.</p>
<p>For some reason, this was leaving a bad aftertaste in my mouth.</p>
<p>‘Then, I will be looking forward to seeing you at the hunting festival. At such events, there’s always something fun waiting in store.’</p>
<p>I recalled that last part in my mind.</p>
<p>Yeah, that’s what’s strangely bothering me.</p>
<p>‘Something fun waiting in store.’</p>
<p>Even if I tried to analyze every aspect of that statement, it wasn’t a sentence that matched the kind of event a ‘hunting festival’ was.</p>
<p>If there’s some kind of underlying meaning to it, then…</p>
<p>‘He must be insinuating that something is going to happen during the hunting festival.’</p>
<p>I tapped one empty corner of the letter with a fingertip, then I pushed it aside.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get rid of that nagging feeling, but really, I might just be overthinking it.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether he really left that kind of implication, I couldn’t dig deeper with just this letter alone.</p>
<p>Mulling over two short sentences would be meaningless.</p>
<p>And it would just be a waste of my time.</p>
<p>I reached for Daniel’s letter this time.</p>
<p>There was a folded piece of white paper from inside the white envelope.</p>
<p>I took it out and instantly clicked my tongue.</p>
<p>Tsk.</p>
<p>‘This guy, seriously. He can’t read the room at all.’</p>
<p>Daniel sent numerous letters before this, and the contents of those letters were consistently just easy-going drivel about his daily life.</p>
<p>I had no interest in other people’s daily lives though, so I only replied conventionally.</p>
<p>While Daniel’s letters were packed with many written accounts, my replies were always just less than half of his.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, that man sent letters my way consistently.</p>
<p>He imparted not much information.</p>
<p>This letter was no different.</p>
<p>How the weather had changed, what kind of food was good these days.</p>
<p>And in addition, the hunting festival was coming, so he was asking to meet on that day.</p>
<p>He brought up meeting each other during the hunting festival just like Leo, but the way he viewed that day was evidently different.</p>
<p>‘I agree that beasts that harm people should be put down, but I don’t understand what joy could be derived from taking lives from other beings.’</p>
<p>That’s how Daniel’s letter went.</p>
<p>Indeed, he was from House Freesia, which ruled over divine power.</p>
<p>With my elbow on the table and my chin propped on my palm, I folded Daniel’s letter with my other hand.</p>
<p>I pushed it aside along with Leo’s letter, then with my fingertips, I tapped the desk.</p>
<p>Tap, tap, tap.</p>
<p>Freesia and Carter.</p>
<p>‘As expected, I shouldn’t have gotten myself involved with either.’</p>
<p>Both were just troublesome.</p>
<p>“Diana.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Milady.”</p>
<p>Diana had been standing still while I was reading the letters, but she quickly replied the moment I called her.</p>
<p>“Letters from these two… Did Alicia receive any as well?”</p>
<p>“I believe so. The head maid gave me and Lady Alicia’s maid two letters each.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>If Alicia’s maid received two letters at the same time as Diana also did, then the senders should be Daniel and Leo, too.</p>
<p>“I hope those letters don’t have the same nonsense in them.”</p>
<p>I muttered as I narrowed my eyes.</p>
<p>What came to mind was an afterimage of Leo’s sticky smile when our gazes met back then.</p>
<p>I closed my heavy eyelids for a moment, then I opened them slowly.</p>
<p>Brushing away the hair that was on my cheek, I took out the two stark letters.</p>
<p>I was in a bad mood now, but since I received these letters, I had to reply.</p>
<p>This was also a matter that involved the family.</p>
<p>Really, I’m in a terrible mood.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alicia, at around the same time.</p>
<p>These days, Alicia was facing the golden age of her life.</p>
<p>To be more precise, it was the golden age of her happiness.</p>
<p>‘Father showed Mother’s garden to me, I eat together with Sister often, and Brother sometimes goes on strolls with me!’</p>
<p>She thought that it would be nice if they could all spend time together—Father, Brother, Sister and her. However, she decided not to be too greedy.</p>
<p>She was already so very grateful for the happiness she was experiencing now.</p>
<p>Although she occasionally still had nightmares about her departed nanny, this misfortune was small compared to the vast amount of happiness she was feeling now.</p>
<p>And this time…</p>
<p>‘I can get along better with friends who are around the same age.’</p>
<p>She glanced at the two letters she was holding over her chest as she walked lightly around her room.</p>
<p>She could do this only because there was no one watching.</p>
<p>As though she was dancing, she was lithe like a cat.</p>
<p>Soon, she plopped down on her big, fluffy bed.</p>
<p>Lying there, she stretched out both her hands and stared at the letters.</p>
<p>‘Young Duke Leo Carter, and then… Young Duke Daniel Freesia!’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 92</p>
<p>With a wide smile on her lips, Alicia jumped out of bed and headed towards her desk.</p>
<p>Familiarly, she took out her letter opener and neatly cut the top of the envelopes.</p>
<p>And eventually, both the red envelope and the white envelope were wide open, waiting for her to make a choice.</p>
<p>“Which one should I read first?”</p>
<p>Like Rosetta, Alicia had also been exchanging letters with Daniel often.</p>
<p>However, it was the first time she received a letter from Leo.</p>
<p>Her golden eyes, which were as bright as the sun, looked intently at the two letters.</p>
<p>In time, her long but simultaneously short contemplation reached an end.</p>
<p>Alicia reached for Leo Carter’s letter first.</p>
<p>The red envelope.</p>
<p>She decided to read Leo’s letter first, however it wasn’t due to very positive reasons.</p>
<p>‘Something about him makes me uncomfortable.’</p>
<p>That’s how Alicia felt about Leo.</p>
<p>Her sister gave her the advice of, ‘Never be alone with him, never engage in private conversations as much as possible.’</p>
<p>Or perhaps it’s because those red eyes were far redder than she could expect.</p>
<p>Alicia’s first impression of him was quite intense, and he made her feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>She was so nervous about what words that red envelope contained.</p>
<p>So, she wanted to read Leo’s letter quickly so that she could read Daniel’s letter in peace.</p>
<p>‘It’s better to just get it over with first.’</p>
<p>After deciding on this though, Alicia faltered a little.</p>
<p>She soon thought, ‘Am I being a little too suspicious?’</p>
<p>The poor young man just lost his older brother, and she had met him only once. And yet, she was thinking of him so badly…</p>
<p>Of course, she never gossiped about this to anyone, these were just her own thoughts.</p>
<p>Her heart felt heavy because she felt like she herself had become a bad person.</p>
<p>Feeling her heart grow softer, Alicia opened the letter.</p>
<p>〈 Dear Lady Alicia Valentine, 〉</p>
<p>As she slowly read the letter, she felt a bit nervous.</p>
<p>The handwriting was as neat as the man’s demeanor, however unlike the impression she had of him, she felt a small sense of admiration for the man’s graceful cursive script.</p>
<p>〈 I apologize for not writing to you sooner.</p>
<p>More than I initially expected, I was left in shock after my older brother’s passing.</p>
<p>It was a struggle to pull myself together, and I also had to take care of my grieving mother, so I had been left with no time to write to you.</p>
<p>The hunting festival is drawing near, so let us meet once more there.</p>
<p>Then, I will be looking forward to meeting you at the hunting festival. 〉</p>
<p>Alicia did not know, but it was almost exactly the same as the letter that was sent to Rosetta.</p>
<p>It’s just that the end was a little different.</p>
<p>〈 Then, I will be looking forward to meeting you at the hunting festival. I would be very happy if Your Ladyship is also looking forward to the next time we meet. 〉</p>
<p>Alicia’s letter did not say anything about ‘something fun that would happen at the hunting festival’.</p>
<p>And yet, that’s what Rosetta’s letter said.</p>
<p>While taking in the letter’s contents, Alicia blinked. Compared to what she had expected, it was flat.</p>
<p>And with the polite letter going against her strong impressions on the young man, Alicia felt guilty again.</p>
<p>She carefully folded the letter that she had just read.</p>
<p>‘I’ll write back to him later…’</p>
<p>Furtively pushing the letter aside, she picked up Daniel’s letter this time.</p>
<p>Washing away the subtle expression on her face, a smile rose at once.</p>
<p>Her silent heart began to beat a little more.</p>
<p>After Daniel had helped her with his divine power back then, she sometimes dreamed of him.</p>
<p>Of that warm energy, of the way her pain disappeared at once, and how only the impression of gentle kindness was left.</p>
<p>Besides that, she felt a bit more comfortable with him thanks to their occasional correspondence.</p>
<p>Whenever she met other people, the first thing she’d feel was discomfort. However, it wasn’t so bad around Daniel.</p>
<p>The occasional correspondence between them detailing their mundane, everyday life was her small dose of happiness.</p>
<p>Carefully, Alicia opened the letter.</p>
<p>“Dear Lady Alicia,”</p>
<p>Reading the first part of the letter out loud, Alicia smiled bashfully. Her round eyes cheerfully read the rest of the letter.</p>
<p>〈 Dear Lady Alicia,</p>
<p>How are you doing these days, Lady Alicia?</p>
<p>The heat has gone away a lot in the meantime while the weather is starting to get colder. It’s easier to fall sick during times like this, isn’t it?</p>
<p>Please be careful so that you’re in tip-top shape despite how different the temperature is between night and day.</p>
<p>If you fall sick, it would also sadden me so.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>Oh, and the hunting festival is almost here.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to the grand event, but I don’t think I’ll be able to kill any of the animals.</p>
<p>I am someone who heals, so I am not confident in taking another’s life.</p>
<p>I know that I may be criticized for seeming weak in doing so, but I’m writing about this here because I believe that you’ll understand me.</p>
<p>Well then, I’ll be looking forward to meeting you at the hunting festival.</p>
<p>When that time comes, let’s have a pleasant chat, too. 〉</p>
<p>There’s nothing much in the letter’s contents, but even so, Alicia was happy anyway.</p>
<p>There was someone else who told her about his daily life, and at the same time, he listened to her as well.</p>
<p>Daniel’s letters always gave her such a soft, fluffy feeling.</p>
<p>After reading the body of the letter, Alicia soon read the postscript added below.</p>
<p>“Oh my!”</p>
<p>Unknowingly, a small exclamation brought upon by admiration left her lips.</p>
<p>Alicia blushed even more compared to when she was reading the body of the letter.</p>
<p>Then, after reading the postscript, she folded the letter and pushed it to the side.</p>
<p>And she took out two new sheets of paper.</p>
<p>There was a tingling feeling in her hands because she wanted to reply as soon as she could.</p>
<p>Alicia dipped her quill into the inkwell, then she pondered as she stared at the white sheet of paper.</p>
<p>She mulled over what she was going to write for quite a while. Still, even as she worried over the matter like this, she was in a good mood.</p>
<p>So, after a short yet long period of contemplation, Alicia slowly wrote on the piece of paper.</p>
<p>“Dear Young Duke Daniel Freesia,”</p>
<p>The sentiment of what she mostly wrote down mirrored Daniel’s letter.</p>
<p>She mentioned the mundane things that happened lately and also a few stories, just like what Daniel said.</p>
<p>She also said that she was looking forward to meeting him at the hunting festival.</p>
<p>Her small, round letters gradually lined the letter paper.</p>
<p>And just like that, the long piece of white paper was quickly filled.</p>
<p>After writing many things, Alicia nodded satisfactorily. However, the hand holding that quill did not stop there.</p>
<p>Like with Daniel’s letter, she also wrote a postscript at the end.</p>
<p>P.S.</p>
<p>“Congratulations! I’m glad to hear that House Freesia’s sacred relic reacted to you. There’s still some time before the coming-of-age ceremony, but it’s amazing that this happened.”</p>
<p>She murmured with a small voice as she wrote down the same words.</p>
<p>“Certainly, you’ll be chosen as the master of the sacred relic once you reach adulthood. And just as you said, I will keep this a secret. I won’t tell my family either, so there’s nothing for you to worry about. Then, I’ll be seeing you on the day of the hunting festival.”</p>
<p>She conveyed her congratulations once again, then she signed her name, Alicia Valentine.</p>
<p>After happily checking her completed letter, she folded it carefully into the envelope and sealed it.</p>
<p>She also did not forget to write a reply to Leo.</p>
<p>After writing both letters, Alicia immediately pulled the rope beside her bed.</p>
<p>She tugged more urgently than how she usually would.</p>
<p>Expressing her true feelings, she did so just as hurriedly as she completed both letters.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, amidst a dark evening—</p>
<p>Here as well, there was one more person looking forward to the hunting festival.</p>
<p>Someone who was anticipating the hunting festival more than anyone else in the whole empire.</p>
<p>It was a man.</p>
<p>He contentedly smiled as he looked down at the two letters in front of him.</p>
<p>Both were sealed with the crest of House Valentine.</p>
<p>The man reached out and picked one of them up.</p>
<p>The only light sources around him were the subtle moonlight pouring through the window and the singular flame on a candle, shaking precariously. Nevertheless, the man read the letter over and over again.</p>
<p>Until the edges of the letter had become worn out.</p>
<p>“Good grief.”</p>
<p>He looked at the wrinkled edges of the letter and briefly murmured his lamentation.</p>
<p>He soon sealed the letter once more with a careful touch, as though he was holding precious treasure.</p>
<p>One mistake was enough to wear out precious things.</p>
<p>He stared at the envelope with a prolonged gaze, but with his arms resting on the desk, he closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Through those closed eyes, one person’s image lingered.</p>
<p>That person’s hair was golden blond first, then became silver.</p>
<p>Her eyes were blue at first, and then became golden.</p>
<p>Clearly in his mind, he saw the specter of a woman, wavering and staggering countless times.</p>
<p>A woman with dazzling silver hair and lustrous golden eyes.</p>
<p>The image of Rosetta.</p>
<p>While repeatedly calling up the face of the ever-disinterested woman, the man smiled tenderly.</p>
<p>Those red lips of his tugged up into a saccharine smile.</p>
<p>“…The hunting festival. I’ll finally meet you again, Rita.”</p>
<p>The curled lips crooned with a low voice.</p>
<p>Soon, the man’s eyes slowly opened.</p>
<p>He turned his chair around and gazed at the scene behind him.</p>
<p>Through the window, which had a clear view of the round moon.</p>
<p>It’s been such a long time since he had seen such a blue expanse.</p>
<p>Small animals, large animals.</p>
<p>And, people of all ages.</p>
<p>Blue beast.</p>
<p>Blue monster.</p>
<p>Dead, but have yet to perish. Living, yet not alive.</p>
<p>The man’s dry eyes scanned through the many monsters before him.</p>
<p>Still sitting on that chair with his legs elegantly crossed, one foot bobbed up and down lightly.</p>
<p>“I’ve prepared a surprise event, so it would be nice to see Rita’s surprised reaction.”</p>
<p>‘It’s only natural that someone on the receiving end of a gift should be surprised.’</p>
<p>These words were from the days when Rita still smiled. It’s what she told him.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>The man’s lips let out a small, cheerful laugh once more.</p>
<p>His body trembled in anticipation.</p>
<p>He did not know how long it had been since the last time his heart was beating this loudly.</p>
<p>Oh, how I look forward to the hunting festival.</p>
<p>My Rita.</p>
<p>My Rosetta.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It’s been a few days now since the northern forest near the capital began bustling with activity.</p>
<p>The procession of the aristocrats’ carriages continued for several days, and soon, temporary barracks were built one by one in the large clearing.</p>
<p>Those tents would be taken down after a few days, but they boasted of such durability and elegance that it didn’t seem like that at all.</p>
<p>Those barracks would be used as a resting place for the nobles.</p>
<p>There were no building structures in the northern forest, so it was an old tradition for these barracks to be built every ‘hunting festival’.</p>
<p>That’s right. Today was the day everyone was looking forward to.</p>
<p>The opening day of the hunting festival.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 93</p>
<p>There was still some time before the hunting festival to start.</p>
<p>The forest would only be opened in earnest after the emperor would appear on that empty platform and give a short opening speech.</p>
<p>Right now, neither hide nor hair of the emperor could be seen anywhere.</p>
<p>The nobles, meanwhile, chatted amongst themselves with light refreshments in hand.</p>
<p>This hunting festival was a large-scale event in the empire as it was a gathering of aristocrats living all across the east, west, north and south ends of the empire, and this included high-ranking nobles like the members of the three duchies.</p>
<p>There’s no better place than this where people could greet each other face-to-face after such a long while, or expand their connections with new people they were meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>The household heads greeted the other household heads.</p>
<p>The successors greeted the other successors.</p>
<p>Besides them, the young ladies and young lords who were nearing their coming-of-age also gathered and talked amongst themselves.</p>
<p>Here, there were four such young ladies who had grouped together.</p>
<p>Young ladies who would be coming-of-age next year, and whose families were magic households connected to House Carter.</p>
<p>In the group, there was Julie, Pia and Melissa.</p>
<p>“Will the ducal ladies of House Valentine come today?”</p>
<p>“We can finally see their faces.”</p>
<p>“What haughty ducal ladies they are. As far removed as they are from the world, they’ve never even once shown their faces.”</p>
<p>Despite those sharp remarks, the lips that uttered those words had soft smiles.</p>
<p>It wasn’t very polite of them to speak as such, but the other nobles were each absorbed in their own conversations, so they did not attract anyone’s attention.</p>
<p>As busy as they were talking about other people, they couldn’t be bothered about the other groups around them.</p>
<p>However, there was one person.</p>
<p>In that group of four, there was one person who couldn’t join the conversation. She instead smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>Evelyn Riddle.</p>
<p>She was Count Riddle’s only daughter.</p>
<p>‘How could they thoughtlessly talk about other people’s business like this…’</p>
<p>Evelyn’s heels tapped the ground in her discomfort.</p>
<p>However, the heaviness of her heart could not be alleviated.</p>
<p>In fact, it wasn’t the first time that Melissa, Julie and Pia had spoken ill of others.</p>
<p>The four of them met during their childhood, for the sake of their families building connections.</p>
<p>Even since that time, they often brought up other people’s business as their conversation topics.</p>
<p>Whether or not they knew about how uncomfortable Evelyn was about this.</p>
<p>The mouths of these three young ladies did not stop.</p>
<p>“I heard that a nanny in House Valentine had been executed because of the abuse she had done. Did you hear about that?”</p>
<p>“Of course I heard about it. What kind of audacity does that nanny have that she dared to do such a thing.”</p>
<p>“That’s what I’m saying. His Grace the Duke was very generous. If I was him, I would have tortured that woman instead of just killing her immediately. Right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I can’t believe that all she faced was execution. As expected, the rumors were true.”</p>
<p>Melissa tapped her fingers, the end of her long nails touching the surface.</p>
<p>She seemed indifferent to the matter, but she was straight to the point.</p>
<p>“What rumors?”</p>
<p>“What rumors though?”</p>
<p>Julie and Pia looked sideways at Evelyn, then hurriedly asked.</p>
<p>Melissa looked at their surroundings with a smile.</p>
<p>She opened her lips to speak only after confirming that there was no one looking at them.</p>
<p>“Word goes that Duke Valentine isn’t fond of his children. Especially his two daughters.”</p>
<p>“Truly? Was there a rumor like that?”</p>
<p>Seemingly shocked by Melissa’s words, Julie asked back with wide eyes.</p>
<p>And with a nonchalant nod, Melissa answered.</p>
<p>“Indeed. The first ducal lady is the daughter of a sinner, isn’t she? She’s not even wanted, how embarrassing.”</p>
<p>Two others nodded as though they agreed, then Pia responded.</p>
<p>“Then perhaps… He knew about the abuse that was going on, but he just let it go?”</p>
<p>“Or maybe the ducal ladies deserve to be beaten.”</p>
<p>“Certainly. It’s expensive maintaining them, but couldn’t they have been a bit more polite in front of their nanny?”</p>
<p>“If they weren’t, then… It’s only natural that she wanted to hit them.”</p>
<p>Ahahaha, that’s too much!</p>
<p>Their laughter rang throughout the space around them.</p>
<p>It was a scene that would make anyone else smile because their smiles looked so natural.</p>
<p>They were just young ladies of the same age who had gathered and were laughing together.</p>
<p>Others would not know how cruel they truly were.</p>
<p>Evelyn couldn’t bear to laugh out loud like them. All she could do was mumble back in response and force her lips to twist up into a smile.</p>
<p>She didn’t have the courage to step up and disagree with them, and so she just hid her true feelings behind that smile.</p>
<p>However, despite her efforts, people who were good at lying were also good at spotting lies.</p>
<p>Even if she smiled like that, sooner or later, they would see through that half-hearted smile.</p>
<p>True enough, after laughing for a while, Melissa cocked her head to the side when she noticed Evelyn smiling awkwardly.</p>
<p>When Melissa stopped laughing, Pia and Julie stopped laughing as well. They looked around.</p>
<p>Soon, they figured out the situation. They also turned their mocking gazes towards Evelyn.</p>
<p>At the end of three piercing gazes now, Evelyn gulped.</p>
<p>She felt her hands going cold, numb. She had a sinking feeling that she had become a cornered mouse.</p>
<p>As if there were three giant snakes flapping their forked tongues at her, Evelyn froze right in front of them.</p>
<p>“Evelyn.”</p>
<p>“Y…Yeah?”</p>
<p>At Melissa’s hushed call, Evelyn blinked.</p>
<p>The tension and agitation she had been trying to hide now clearly rose above, evident on her rigid expression.</p>
<p>Melissa silently stared at her for a long time. Then, she let out a sharp laugh.</p>
<p>“Why are you so nervous, Evelyn?”</p>
<p>A pale, thin hand stretched out and tapped Evelyn on the shoulder.</p>
<p>All four of them were holding drinks in their hands, so every time Melissa tapped Evelyn’s shoulder, the drink inside the glass fluctuated dangerously.</p>
<p>“Nothing, I’m just a bit nervous.”</p>
<p>Evelyn replied with another forced smile.</p>
<p>Again, smirks could be seen and silent chuckles could be heard.</p>
<p>The hand that was tapping Evelyn’s shoulder slowly moved away.</p>
<p>Melissa flicked her hand in the air, as if she had touched something dirty.</p>
<p>Then, as she was standing at the side, Julie sipped her drink then spoke up.</p>
<p>“Evelyn. Is hanging out with us… boring for you?”</p>
<p>“Oh goodness.”</p>
<p>“That can’t be.”</p>
<p>Coming after Julie’s pointed question was an exclamation followed by an exaggerated sigh.</p>
<p>Evelyn kept her lips shut as she trembled.</p>
<p>Judging from her own experience, if she were to answer back now, she would only look foolish.</p>
<p>“Evelyn, smile a little, hm?”</p>
<p>Pia kindly advised Evelyn, who was so stiff that her lips seemed to be sewn shut.</p>
<p>Melissa reached out as though to stop Pia.</p>
<p>“Come now, let it go. Ever since we were young, our dear Evelyn hasn’t enjoyed these kinds of topics.”</p>
<p>Oh, yes. Evelyn, our angel. Our poor angel. Are you perhaps the guardian angel of beggars?”</p>
<p>“Julie, you’re so funny.”</p>
<p>Ahaha.</p>
<p>Once again, a peal of laughter from them poured out.</p>
<p>Each barbed laughter shot out like arrows and dug into Evelyn’s heart.</p>
<p>It has been like this for years now.</p>
<p>These three people’s sarcasm and pointed laughter was familiar to her now, but the pain that was tearing up her chest was something she could never become familiar with.</p>
<p>All she wished for was to get used to all of this so that she could calmly get over the pain.</p>
<p>Their relationship hadn’t been like this in the beginning.</p>
<p>In the past, the other three young ladies used to follow Evelyn.</p>
<p>‘Evelyn, I think you’re really too nice.’</p>
<p>‘Let’s be friends.’</p>
<p>‘I like you the most, Evelyn.’</p>
<p>It was such a hazy past.</p>
<p>Right, it was like that, once upon a time.</p>
<p>Their attitudes began to change after her grandfather, the previous Count Riddle, had passed away and when her father became the next count.</p>
<p>The cause was what happened after that, to be precise.</p>
<p>Back when the previous Count Riddle met his demise,</p>
<p>House Riddle had once been a vassal of House Carter, but as soon as the young count became the household head, they were sent into dire straits.</p>
<p>That was eight years ago.</p>
<p>And back then, Evelyn had been eleven years old.</p>
<p>Little Evelyn couldn’t understand what was happening around her.</p>
<p>Her ever-rich household plummeted into poverty, and the high honor and envy they once received dissipated into vapor.</p>
<p>Melissa, Julie and Pia.</p>
<p>These three girls, who had been her close friends ever since they were five years old, rapidly changed their attitudes towards her.</p>
<p>When Evelyn plunged to the bottom of the barrel in one snap, these three started looking down on her.</p>
<p>It had been a long time since she noticed their change.</p>
<p>The scales tilted instantaneously and they soon ganged up on her, and yet Evelyn closed her eyes to this.</p>
<p>The other three sarcastically comforted her, and yet she thanked them nonetheless, considering their backhanded comfort to still be comfort in the end.</p>
<p>Everyone else left her already, but they were still beside her. She was grateful enough by just that alone.</p>
<p>She chose not to see how she was merely a toy to them now.</p>
<p>Like a fool.</p>
<p>However, those closed eyes eventually opened.</p>
<p>Gradually realizing the reality that was right in front of her, she accepted that they saw her merely as a toy.</p>
<p>How cruel their tongues were.</p>
<p>How sharp their gazes were.</p>
<p>After acknowledging the truth, Evelyn tried to separate herself from the other three.</p>
<p>She didn’t want to be miserable anymore.</p>
<p>She was already miserable enough.</p>
<p>However, things did not go smoothly.</p>
<p>Her father was busy day and night trying to raise up the household that was already too far down on the decline.</p>
<p>He did his magic research during the night, then he would sell his products at his magic shop during the day.</p>
<p>There was no workplace that would dare call a nobleman a laborer, so this was the best that her father could do.</p>
<p>However, not all efforts got their rewards.</p>
<p>In that small shop, only flies came in and out. And apart from that, the funds that he needed for his magic research were always scarce.</p>
<p>He tried to get investors, but no one was willing to help her father.</p>
<p>In the past, those who tried to build connections with him now looked at him with cold, brutal eyes instead, casting him away.</p>
<p>However, her father did not give up.</p>
<p>No matter what kind of humiliation he faced, he stood his ground firmly. For her sake.</p>
<p>Behind his bitter smiles, she knew the depths of his pain.</p>
<p>He had to endure and earn a living—to earn money so he could protect his family.</p>
<p>Her father was protecting their family as best as he could.</p>
<p>That’s why Evelyn, too, wanted to protect their family.</p>
<p>It’s true that she’d be more at ease away from these three people right now, but that would be tantamount to being cut off from this social circle.</p>
<p>It would only trouble her family if that were to happen.</p>
<p>People here were from wealthy aristocratic families who could potentially invest in her father’s research.</p>
<p>In order to gain investors, she had to remain in this social circle.</p>
<p>By any means at all.</p>
<p>Persistently, until the end.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 94</p>
<p>That’s how she lasted for years.</p>
<p>She kept all the humiliation she was being subjected to a secret from her family.</p>
<p>If her parents were to find out, then they would immediately tell her to stop doing such futile things.</p>
<p>But she couldn’t let that happen.</p>
<p>She couldn’t let all that time she endured become nothing.</p>
<p>She had reached this point already. So, Evelyn forced the corners of her lips up.</p>
<p>This forced smile was something she was used to now.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry if you felt uncomfortable because of me.”</p>
<p>Evelyn apologized to them with a trembling voice.</p>
<p>She didn’t do anything wrong, but even when things were left unsaid, she was always the sinner.</p>
<p>As they heard Evelyn’s timid apology, the other three stopped laughing at once.</p>
<p>“Why are you being so serious again?”</p>
<p>Shrugging, Pia said this with a mocking smirk directed at her.</p>
<p>At the same time, there was a rough pat on Evelyn’s shoulder.</p>
<p>And it happened to be the right shoulder. She was holding her hand with her right hand.</p>
<p>The force of it made the red liquid spill over, soaking Evelyn’s chest.</p>
<p>Dazedly, Evelyn looked down at her dress, which had soon become red.</p>
<p>“Oh my, what do we do. Evelyn, how could you spill your drink and waste it like that?”</p>
<p>As Evelyn was at a loss for words, Melissa’s voice rang.</p>
<p>On the surface, she sounded worried for the other young lady, but her eyes were inundated with ridicule.</p>
<p>“Yeah, how could you. Since it spilled like that, you should lick it, right?”</p>
<p>“Goodness, you dirtied the only set of clothes you have? It doesn’t seem like you could have brought any extra like us.”</p>
<p>The two young ladies spoke one after another.</p>
<p>Their blatant cackles spilled through their red lips.</p>
<p>Evelyn closed her eyes tightly.</p>
<p>She just wanted to sink to the ground and scream.</p>
<p>That laughter. Those voices.</p>
<p>Just as they said, her dress had been spilled with a red drink like this, yet she didn’t have any spare clothes.</p>
<p>The whole situation was just so horrible that she wanted to scream.</p>
<p>With her eyes shut, with her eyes covered.</p>
<p>She wanted to shout so loudly that she could see nothing, hear nothing.</p>
<p>“Excuse me…”</p>
<p>It would have been like that, really—had it not been for the unfamiliar voice from behind her.</p>
<p>Proof enough was Evelyn’s half-open lips. After hearing that voice, however, she was jolted back to reality and she came back to her senses.</p>
<p>‘What on earth was I going to do just now…’</p>
<p>If she had screamed here, she would definitely be the only one seen as crazy.</p>
<p>The other three would have laughed even more at her if she acted in such a way. Far louder, more malicious.</p>
<p>“Huu…”</p>
<p>After letting out a long exhale, Evelyn opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Her boiling nerves gradually cooled down.</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>Calm now, after Evelyn opened her eyes, she could only tilt her head to the side as the three other people came into her view.</p>
<p>Those three faces, which had been making such sardonic sneers, were making strange expressions.</p>
<p>They all looked so shocked—as if they were facing a mythical creature.</p>
<p>All their eyes were staring at something behind her.</p>
<p>Perplexed like that, Evelyn slowly turned around, following their gazes.</p>
<p>Then, she saw two women standing there.</p>
<p>Dazzling silver hair and lustrous blond hair.</p>
<p>Both were unbelievably beautiful, and both had golden eyes.</p>
<p>Golden eyes.</p>
<p>Was there a noble out there who didn’t know what that color signified?</p>
<p>‘Valentine…’</p>
<p>Absolutely dumbfounded, Evelyn mentally recited the name of the household which these two women belonged to.</p>
<p>The Valentine Duchy.</p>
<p>It was the very household embroiled in the most recent rumors causing uproar as of late.</p>
<p>The four people, including Evelyn, remained silent as they were enraptured, and so, the silver-haired ducal lady slowly opened lips first.</p>
<p>“What happened here?”</p>
<p>Indeed, her voice, just like her curved eyes. How mesmerizing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>What happened here.</p>
<p>The ambiguous question was met with silence that lasted for a moment.</p>
<p>However, that moment of course ended.</p>
<p>As the most sensible of the four, Melissa took half a step forward and greeted the new arrivals.</p>
<p>“I greet the Ducal Ladies of House Valentine.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t an answer to the question, but it wasn’t bad to start in this way. After all, greeting one another first was only natural among strangers.</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded silently.</p>
<p>Even if she greeted back only with this, the others might accept it, but no other words came back in response. The only other change was the slight change in the way her eyes curved like bows.</p>
<p>‘So it’s natural to know that you’re from House Valentine, but are you saying that you want me to suck it in and introduce myself?’</p>
<p>Melissa bit the inside of her cheek as she tried to read Rosetta’s intentions.</p>
<p>By nature, nobles would not need to introduce themselves.</p>
<p>Even if they didn’t, the other person would naturally know who they were.</p>
<p>However, Melissa wondered how the ducal lady could act so nonchalantly despite never having been to any social gathering before.</p>
<p>‘Is it because you have different blood coursing through your veins?’</p>
<p>However, there’s no point in trying to ask a question that couldn’t be asked out loud.</p>
<p>As the silence became more prolonged, Melissa once more opened her lips, which were quivering this time.</p>
<p>“I am Melissa Merlin.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>The elegant voice expressed only indifference.</p>
<p>Though they were curved, her golden eyes held no interest at all.</p>
<p>Melissa’s expression became distorted because of this humiliation.</p>
<p>Either way, whatever.</p>
<p>Rosetta slowly looked at the other young ladies standing behind Melissa.</p>
<p>Alicia stuck close to Rosetta, making sure to follow Rosetta’s gaze as well.</p>
<p>Whenever the two pairs of golden eyes met theirs, the young ladies introduced themselves.</p>
<p>“I am Julie Presso.”</p>
<p>“I am Pia March. It is an honor to meet you both, Lady Valentine.”</p>
<p>These words were conveyed with a friendly tone, with smiles on their faces.</p>
<p>Nobody would be able to imagine that the same mouths had been talking smack about Rosetta and Alicia just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes. Nice to meet you.”</p>
<p>Rosetta responded only after they greeted her one after another.</p>
<p>Alicia didn’t even speak to them.</p>
<p>To hide her nervousness, she was just trying her best to control the look in her eyes.</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced over to Alicia and brushed against her shoulder lightly.</p>
<p>Soon, that slow-moving golden gaze turned to the last remaining person.</p>
<p>To Evelyn.</p>
<p>Her eyes met with Rosetta’s gaze head-on. However, she lowered her head unconsciously.</p>
<p>She could heel the ducal lady’s gaze boring into her bowing head.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Lady Valentine. I am Evelyn Riddle.”</p>
<p>Her tense voice uttered the greeting a little awkwardly.</p>
<p>‘What’s with the trembling voice, you sound like a fool.’</p>
<p>Rebuking herself, Evelyn bit her lower lip and raised her head.</p>
<p>However, she fixed her gaze at something indistinct because she wasn’t confident looking into the eyes of the ducal lady. Not after that stupid mistake earlier.</p>
<p>But, after that.</p>
<p>“If you’re Evelyn Riddle, then are you from the Riddle County?”</p>
<p>With a response unlike before, everyone’s eyes turned to Rosetta.</p>
<p>Evelyn was too dazed to respond and so she instead nodded. At this, Rosetta gave her a soft smile.</p>
<p>It was not like the insincere smile she had given until now. This time, her smile held a little more emotion.</p>
<p>At a loss for words, Evelyn could only stare blankly at Rosetta.</p>
<p>Her beauty seemed to shine even more brightly as she now had a genuine smile.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Lady Riddle.”</p>
<p>Rosetta faced Evelyn with a warm, tranquil smile. Then, as though she had just noticed, she blinked confusedly.</p>
<p>“But Lady Riddle. It seems as though your clothes are a bit soaked.”</p>
<p>Rosetta carefully broached the subject, but this made Evelyn hastily cover her chest.</p>
<p>She was so shocked by the sudden appearance of the two ducal ladies that she forgot how her chest had been soaked with her drink.</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>Evelyn trailed off, not being able to answer.</p>
<p>‘I spilled my drink over my dress, but I can’t change because I don’t have extra clothes.’</p>
<p>It was such a lame and humiliating excuse.</p>
<p>As though faced with splendid roses, Evelyn felt like she had become nothing but a detestable weed marring the garden.</p>
<p>Melissa stared quietly at Evelyn for a short while, then she smirked.</p>
<p>With a hesitating prey right in front of her, Melissa did not miss this chance.</p>
<p>She quickly hid that smirk then donned a look of pity and regret.</p>
<p>And, with words that matched what Evelyn had been thinking, she opened her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“Lady Riddle accidentally spilled her drink over her dress.”</p>
<p>After stepping forward and speaking up, Melissa patted Evelyn’s forearm gently.</p>
<p>As she felt that gentle touch on her, goosebumps ran down Evelyn’s spine.</p>
<p>Just thinking about what kind of spectacle Melissa would make out of her, Evelyn’s fingers started shaking.</p>
<p>With a low, sidelong glance, Melissa saw those trembling fingers and clasped them with one of her own hands.</p>
<p>Then, she let out a deep sigh before she continued.</p>
<p>“She spilled a drink on her dress, but she couldn’t prepare any extra clothes because her family’s circumstances are a bit…”</p>
<p>When she trailed off like that, her underlying insinuation became more pronounced.</p>
<p>It might not be easy to notice because of her tone.</p>
<p>However, Evelyn had known Melissa for a very long time. She knew she was being ridiculed at once. Her fingertips, as they were being held by Melissa’s slender grasp, grew even colder.</p>
<p>“Oh gosh.”</p>
<p>Though Alicia kept silent until now, a small cry spilled through her lips.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Rosetta said nothing in return as she stared at the young lady’s strange expression.</p>
<p>Julie and Pia noticed that Melissa was trying to humiliate Evelyn, and they stepped up as well.</p>
<p>They didn’t know why the ducal ladies were showing an interest only in Evelyn, but if Evelyn were to be removed from here, then the ducal ladies’ interest would be theirs to have.</p>
<p>‘The first to build connections with the two ducal ladies of the rumors.’</p>
<p>What a coveted role to have.</p>
<p>Although those two were the esteemed daughters of the Valentine Duchy, the other young ladies here were from vassal households of the Carter Duchy. So, there was no harm in making friends with nobles of a higher rank.</p>
<p>The two young ladies geared up to speak. And so they did, one after another.</p>
<p>“We wanted to lend her some of our clothes, but it’s a shame. It doesn’t seem like they would fit her.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. But look at you, all soaked. Why don’t you go and get a bit of rest, Evelyn?”</p>
<p>What reached her ears was malice masked by false concern.</p>
<p>At the wave of shame rushing at her, Evelyn bit the inside of her cheek once again.</p>
<p>They’re doing this in front of people they’re meeting for the first time. They were the same age, but it was in front of a duke’s daughters.</p>
<p>For them to do this to her right here. It felt like Evelyn was going to suffocate from all this shame.</p>
<p>Just like what the other three wanted, Evelyn wanted to leave this place.</p>
<p>If she wouldn’t leave, their ridicules would just worsen, and in turn, she would just become more miserable.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>‘This is a rare opportunity to talk to high nobles…’</p>
<p>Besides, the high nobles here were, for some reason, showing interest in her.</p>
<p>There was no better opportunity in the world.</p>
<p>If she could establish connections with high nobles, this would be one step closer to solving the problem of her father’s lacking investments.</p>
<p>The reality of her situation and the emotions right now clashed together in her mind.</p>
<p>What choice should she make?</p>
<p>Her short, yet lengthy contemplation left Evelyn conflicted.</p>
<p>However, her relentless dilemma ended without results from herself.</p>
<p>Because of sudden high-pitched shrieks.</p>
<p>“Kyaah!”</p>
<p>“AHH!”</p>
<p>“Oh my god!”</p>
<p>Those were the screams of Melissa, Julie and Pia.</p>
<p>One after another.</p>
