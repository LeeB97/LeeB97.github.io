<p>According to Lena’s data they lived in large Hives and could communicate with each other through high-frequency waves. Also, just like the termites they had a Queen bee which they answered to. They had very high mobility in the air, and their stinger was their main weapon. However, although they looked similar to an enlarged form of a bee back on earth, the main difference was that their stingers were reusable, so they didn’t have that crucial weakness.</p>
<p>Buwong!</p>
<p>A killer bee flew just two meters over our heads, then hovered there, staring down at us with its multiple eyes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master should I kill it?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, we are out here exploring so we will only strike in self defense.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I looked purposefully towards Lilinor and she nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Buwong!</p>
<p>It understood that we had no intention of harming it.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow, this is on an entirely different level when compared to the flower garden at the entrance!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right! I so want to lie down on those flowers after using Polymorph!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Come down Lillinor, if you do that we might need to fight against those Killer bees!”</i></strong></p>
<p>An enormous field of flowers stretched out as far as the eye can see. However these flowers were far bigger than normal, it was as if we had come to a world of giants.</p>
<p>Thud! Kuwooong! Kuwooong!</p>
<p>The shadow of a huge being loomed in the distance.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that a giant?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not exactly, actually they are known as Titans, they can be considered as Demigods”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What? A Demigod?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena’s explanation soon followed to help me out.</p>
<p>“Right Johra, they are the half god species which stayed neutral during the civil war among Gods. It is likely that the guardian of this floor is that Titan.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lilinor it seems that we might have to fight the Titan in order to progress. How do you feel about that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s try talking to it first. Contrary to what most people think, many Titans are actually intelligent creatures.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, in any case, at worst we simply don’t go on to the next level.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although fighting and gaining experience was one of the main purposes of our visit to this dungeon, our main goal was to kill monsters like those termites and bees, not humanoid ones. It would be a good idea to talk to the Titan, but in truth there was little hope as most creatures we’ve encountered in the dungeon have been very hostile</p>
<p><strong><i>“Alright Johra, then I’ll fly ahead and try talking to it.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Polymorph!”</i></strong> Phaaaaat</p>
<p>Lilinor took her dragon form and when to have a chat with the Titan.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn Lilinor, give us more of a heads up!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I grumbled as I embraced Viezda who was about to lose her balance, but Lilinor had already flown out of reach.</p>
<p>“Is this space</p>
<p>The ceiling was almost 100 meters tall this time, littered with crystal which emitted a bright light. As far as I could tell the area was at least 2 kilometers long, and didn’t at all feel like an underground dungeon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you alright? Did you get injured?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda blushed as I held her in my arms. I was worried that she had been affected by the cold due to Lilinor’s dragon transformation, but she shook her head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s go catch up with Lilinor.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master.”</i></strong></p>
<p>As we approached we noticed that they were still discussing something. Compared to Lilinor, the Titan was even bigger at almost 20 meters tall.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So that is a Titan? Can I win against him?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I found myself wondering out loud, I worried that it might be considered as a rude question, but luckily it was not the case.</p>
<p><strong><i>“My name is Damascus, proud son of Hecate. Small kind creatures, you didn’t fight anyone on this floor. I look favorably upon you for not harming the bees of flowers in this garden, so I will give you permission to move on to the next floor.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>The Titan then turned his back to us and carved a symbol on the ground before saying.</p>
<p>I have temporarily opened the magic circle leading to the next floor, You may continue your adventure.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah wait! May take note of the coordinates to this dimension so we may return in the future?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I cried out desperately for the permission to come back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, as long as you come in peace, you may come visit this beautiful garden of mine any time.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll show the necessary steps to copy the coordinates on your cornea.:”</i></strong></p>
<p>With Lena’s help I completed the magic circle.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What kind of magic circle is this Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It should be one used to move between dimensions, so if we leave our mark on it we can return here anytime we’d like.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why does it feel like you can do anything Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all, I just do my best.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He’s my Master, so he can do anything!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So, how about heading over to the next level?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes”</i></strong></p>
<p>On the next floor we found the exact type of monsters we were looking for.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of wild dogs, roaming the misty forests in lage packs. Well, it would be more accurate to describe them as Hell Hounds as they could breathe fire. Still, they would be easy opponents for Lilinor</p>
<p>Aaaah!</p>
<p><strong><i>[+1321 experience points]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired knowledge of Hell Hounds]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lilinor, don’t kill them!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why, they were the ones that attacked first no?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I need them.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… okay then.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor pouted as she folded her arms in complaint. Although it was true that we had made a rule to not have mercy on any creatures which went out of their way to attack us, She was pouting because I scolded her despite her following the rule. I told the girls to wait at the</p>
<p>Tsss! Tak</p>
<p>Using my Web Shot, I travelled to the closest tree.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena can you project their positions to me please.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Sure, using a combination of sonar and infrared, I’ll display their positions directly to your cornea.</p>
<p>Despite the heavy mist, I was able to clearly see the position of all the hounds nearby in 3D.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, I guess I should get started.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I used my Web Shot to muzzle the hounds as well as bind their legs. By the time I had tied them all up, the proficiency of my Web Shot rose to level 4.</p>
<p>It only took about an hour to bind the 600 or so Hellhounds that were in my vicinity. It was quite an unfair advantage to be able to see them so clearly under these misty conditions, so it was a one sided battle.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Now that we’ve mixed in carbon nanotubes with the web, they can’t resist at all.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“In order to break free through physical strength alone, they would need to be at least ten times stronger.</p>
<p>Gging gging</p>
<p>As I listened to Lena’s explanation I gathered up all 600 of them and secured them all in the same spot, in the middle of the forest. It resulted in a mountain of living bodies, struggling to break free which was quite the amusing sight. It was almost like it was on large squirting creature, everything was going according to plan.</p>
<p>I went back to fetch Lilinor and Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, what is this?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Experience Viezda. I’ll have to ask you to use you maximum strength fireball; and Lilinor will use her breath at the same time to finish off all those who didn’t die yet. Wait for my signal to make sure you time it well.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor was excited and began to breathe in, while Viezda began here chant.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Poison Fog”</i></strong></p>
<p>I sent out my poison and waited a short time before giving them the signal to attack.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Three! Two! One! Now!”</i></strong></p>
<p>PooAaah! Wharrrrr</p>
<p>An Ice Breath and a oversized Fireball shot out towards the large mountain or wriggling flesh. It erupted into flames, and then immediately after froze into a lump of ice.</p>

<p>I looked sheepishly towards Lilinor which caught the falling Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I have a secret that allows me to gain a lot of experience.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor looked suspiciously at the mountain of corpses which had been charred black before being frozen into a large lump of ice.</p>

<p><strong><i>‘My stats seem to grow much quicker than Viezda’s, but she seems to also have some special ability to learn skills as she levels up, without needing to read them in a book. Well it seems to be worth it to go dungeon diving every now and then, I’ve grown a lot stronger. ㅋㅋㅋㅋ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra this is too strange, these low level creatures shouldn’t be able to allow me to level up….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well it’s not a bad thing right?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor was still filled with questions, but I only gave her some vague answer. Making sure that she was taking good care of Viezda, I kept scouting around the place.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It should be about 150 meters away. I’ll send his position to you, but it looks like a Cerberus.”</i></strong></p>
<p>A large three headed dog soon came into sight. I wanted to get a good idea as to how strong I was, so I chose to solo the boss.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Despite my huge increase in strength, I still feel a hint of danger from it, could it be my new Danger Premonition skill?”</i></strong></p>
<p>At the end of the forest stood Cerberus, guarding the cave entrance behind it. His body size was about as big as Lillnor.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“He seems to be about B rank?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Krrng</p>
<p>One of Cerberus’ heads caught sight of me and growled.</p>
<p>Tsss! Tsss! Tsss!</p>
<p>I tried the same trick as with the Hell Hounds, trying to tie its mouth with my carbon nanotube reinforced Web Shots, but it tore through it quite easily.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess my reinforced web isn’t enough against a boss class monster.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I barely caught sight of its tail rushing towards me, and I dodged by shooting a web to the closest tree.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Was that a snake? Was Cerberus’ tail supposed to be that of a snake?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Unlike the three heads which only stared at me hungrily, it was the tail that was doing most of</p>
<p>PooAaah! PooAaah!</p>
<p>Two of its heads shot out a Fire and Ice Breath, flanking me from the sides just as I had dodged the tail.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn, this is getting too dangerous! Lena!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I instantly asked for Lena to help with the Rohim’s Shield.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m on it!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Taking their attacks head on, I was sent flying back into the forest. Thankfully the shield was there to protect my life, but I wasn’t in any hurry to return to the battle. Likewise, Cerberus didn’t chase me, and stayed in its post as the entrance’s guard dog.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmmm it only thinks about guarding the entrance? Should I try out my new skill? Insta-Kill Poison Needle!”</i></strong></p>
<p>As soon as I cast the new skill, a long white needle appears from my middle knuckle on each hand.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Insta-Kill? I wonder if that’s the case, or if there is only a certain percentage chance, I should try it out.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Krrrr pahaaaa shoopat!</p>
<p>Cerberus sensed me from quite a distance and shot a breath my way. I used my Web Shot to swing from tree to tree. Even needing to roll around occasionally to dodge the tail which had a far longer reach than I expected. Finally using my superior agility, I was able to flank it from the side and stab it with the white needle.</p>
<p>Phhhhhu</p>
<p><strong><i>[Instant Poison level 1 ➢ 2]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Was it a failure in the end? Yeah,, as expected there is only a certain chance of success.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“It didn’t die right away and struck me with its tail. Rolling around I used my Web Shot to swing my way to its other side and stabbed it once again.</p>

<p><strong><i>[Acquired knowledge of Cerberus]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Already dead? It wasn’t that bad I guess.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stared into the cave which stood behind its corpse.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that the path towards the next level?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I went back to getch Lilinor and the now awakened Viezda and proceeding to the next floor. But, unexpectedly there wasn’t a new dungeon floor awaiting us.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s that, doesn’t it look like an enormous temple?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It should be… its a temple of the Gods, and it’s even rumoured that one of the Evil Gods which sided with Metatron is sealed here.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor spoke out as she stared at the huge temple with her arms crossed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it truly a temple of a God?”</i></strong></p>
<p>At that very moment an old man in gray clothing appeared before us.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You’ve gone through many tribulations to appear here adventurers. I even wondered if anyone would ever make it here.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although the old man had an imposing presence, he didn’t give off any dangerous feeling of an enemy.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Who are you?”</i></strong> Viezda asked bravely.</p>
<p>I however already had a good guess as to his identity.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Me? Well… where should I start….”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 97</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess I can be considered as a spirit form of Jeduth.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So it’s like that?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had heard from Lena that Jeduth was a god who had the appearance of a gray haired old man with a powerful and intimidating voice.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Weren’t you sealed away?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ho ho, so there is a dragon with you? Yes, well at least now I understand how you managed to reach all the way here. I’m not Jeduth’s true self, but rather a memory left behind to provide guidance to others.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Guidance?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, just before my main body was sealed away, I was created to help out adventurers such as yourself.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ha… help out? Are you sure you aren’t here to fight us instead?”</i></strong></p>
<p>From the narrowing of Lilinor’s eyes, it was clear that she held a grudge against this God.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh not at all, rather I’m here to reward the adventurer which has managed to clear the dungeon.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Reward? What kind of reward are we talking about?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was quite interested in so called reward. Also, the kind of information he could provide me with as one who had fought directly against the council of High Gods was priceless. The spirit of Jeduth seemed to take his time and think carefully.</p>
<p>“Well the reward is only a one time thing and it goes to the first one to clear the dungeon. In fact, I never expected that I would have to give it out simply based on the power of the monsters like the Beholder and Hydra. Not to mention that you managed to kill Cerberus which is close to being a God ranked creature. It was quite beyond any of my expectations.</p>
<p>After quite the long rant where the spirit in Jeduth’s form went on mumbling to himself, Lilinor interrupted him.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So where is this great reward? Since we’ve done all that then why don’t you bring it out?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… actually it isn’t anything special actually. It’s just this simple looking necklace which my main body used.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ha, just a simple necklace?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“This is all I have with me right now, if it isn’t to your satisfaction I’ll return with another reward, please wait one moment.”</i></strong></p>
<p>As Lilinor was getting angry over the nonchalance shown by the gray haired man before us, Lena suddenly interrupted.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Make sure to get that necklace at all costs. There are certain myths which claim that Jeduth used to be a human, and that he only ascended to Godhood through the use of a certain necklace.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After hearing Lena’s explanation, I quickly interrupted Lilinor’s rant and chose to accept the necklace as the reward.</p>
<p>Lilinor looked back at me in a mixture of shock and betrayal, but Jeduth’s memory stepped forward and placed the necklace in my outstretched hand.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you accept this reward as satisfactory compensation?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, just a moment Jeduth.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Out of nowhere Viezda decided to interrupt.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, what is it that you want Elf lady?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Can I ask you a question?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure, but we don’t have much time left.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Time?”</i></strong> Lilinor asked.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh right, didn’t I mention this? Now that you’ve received the reward, then the dungeon will soon close, it’s all according to my contract.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What contract is that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It has to do with those damned High Gods. Anyways, what was it that you were curious about Elf lady?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I</p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed my original body had a certain connection with them, but you don’t seem to be a Dark Elf.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I used to be one, but I’ve now become a Moon Elf.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, is that so? Then the prophecy has come to pass.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What prophecy?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I wondered whether it had already been predicted long ago that Viezda would become a Moon Elf.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, there was a prophecy circulating amongst the Gods. It was concerning a Moon Elf which would arrive after the civil war between the Gods. I feel like there was more to it than that, but I can’t remember the whole thing.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What! Why don’t you remember the most crucial part?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shouted out but he simply ignored me.</p>
<p>“Indeed Miss Moon Elf, now that you’ve evolved into your current form, then the curse which had been placed on the Dark Elves has been lifted. However, the High Gods will no longer be restricted from interfering with the mortal realm.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you Jeduth.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda bowed down to him, obviously grateful.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What restrictions were you talking about?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah so it was like that?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor spoke out softly, clearly she knew something but had been keeping it from me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t you know about the time that the High Gods were chased out of the Mortal realm?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, please explain.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Well that Dragon girl seems to know something, but it isn’t any big secret. In fact it was the council of the High Gods which were defeated by Metatron’s camp in the war between the Gods. However, this resulted in the GodKing himself, Skyfather, descending in order to Metatron away. Still, as punishment the Gods were banished from the Mortal realm and could only return if a God-level dangerous creature appeared.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dangerous creature?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, it doesn’t matter who or what it is, but rather its potential. In fact, a Moon Elf is such a creature, so now that the curse on the Dark Elves had been lifted, the High Gods will soon learn of this fact. The pact which my main body had made with the Dark Elves was that their curse would be erased with the arrival of a Moon Elf.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then doesn’t that mean that the council of High Gods will all be out hunting for Viezda?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, since I was able to lift the eternal curse on my race, I have no qualms with giving up my life in exchange.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Nonsense Viezda, your life belongs to me so you can’t simply give it away without my permission.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry Master, I hadn’t thought about that.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ha, what a self-centered little Elf you are.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor spoke out, but I was a bit disappointed with her line of thinking.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey, spirit of Jeduth, then can this necklace be used to achieve Godhood?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How did you know that? Still, even if you do I wouldn’t recommend you taking that path.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why is that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“To become a god you first have to solve the necklace’s curse, and that process alone is much worse than dying. My previous self lost everything due to that necklace, and it was all a part of Metatron’s plan. I definitely don’t recommend you to use it.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Curse? What kind of curse? How do I become a</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why is it that you want to become a god? From what I can see you seem to be powerful enough as it is.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I have a lot of people I want to protect, including Viezda over here.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see… well if you plan on saving that Moon Elf lady, then this necklace can certainly help.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then how does one become a god with the necklace?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s easy enough. You simply have to wear it at all times and overcome the curse you are presented with. Only then will you become a god.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It doesn’t sound too difficult. It must be that the curse is very hard to overcome.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, one can’t know what the curse is before putting the necklace on, and after that it is too late. Naturally it will be a terrible curse since the necklace grants you the power of a God, a certain price needs to be paid.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When will the High Gods become aware of Viezda’s existence?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“It’s hard to say exactly, but their Angels descend upon the Mortal plane on a regular basis so I’d expect it wouldn’t be too long. Well, all long as you are in this dungeon you will be safe because the seal created to trap my main body, can also shield you from their prying eyes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So it’s all okay as long as we are inside the dungeon right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but in the next five minutes you will be kicked out.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What? Why so sudden?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve already given you your reward. But above all else I don’t want to spend any more time with a Dragon or Moon Elf.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Didn’t you mention before that you had a certain contract with the High Gods to uphold?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but I’ve already completed my end when I handed you the reward, so I think I’ll be closing the dungeon for the next little while. Taking a little break would be nice”</i></strong></p>
<p>He was quite the annoying fella. I expected that a God which rebelled against the tyranny of the High Gods would instead be a good guy, but the problems as that he was simply too lazy!</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then where will you be sending us?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“In the time it takes for you to blink you will be back in the garden of flowers, just before you entered the Labyrinth.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jeduth face turned bright, no doubt envisioning kicking out us pesky invaders.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Phit That personality you have is what made you get captured by the High Gods. Even if you have a strong power, you don’t use to its fullest potential because of your laziness.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lillnor spat out venomously.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, I don’t have much of a choice in the matter because I’m simply a memory, so I have the same personality as my true body once had. Also, I’ve managed to complete my promise to the Dark Elves by lifting their curse, so that’s another weight off my shoulders. All in all its been quite a fruitful day.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I have one more question.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What is it? We really don’t have much time.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What was the curse that Jeduth had to overcome to become a God?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you really wish to know?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes!”</i></strong></p>
<p>He stared into my eyes for a little while before continuing.</p>
<p>“He appeared in a Dungeon and had to kill 100,000 monsters while only</p>
<p><strong><i>“What… is that even possible?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Normally it wouldn’t be, but Jeduth succeeded due to Metatron’s assistance. Still, the curse you receive can be entirely unrelated, it all depends on the necklace.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wait! Wait! I have one more ques….”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was cut off as we were all suddenly teleported out of the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra did you save the marker for that dimension?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah….”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had forgotten to do so, but luckily we still had the coordinates for the Titan’s floor. Yes, we would definitely be going there. I had made a decision after taking a look at Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena let’s quickly head back to the Titan’s floor.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, I’ll project to you the instructions now.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Right away I began to create a temporary magic circle by drawing in the ground and using any branches I found nearby.</p>
<p>Seeing me create the spatial magic circle, Lilinor spoke to me worriedly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry but we will have to go our separate ways now. I have something very important which I need to do.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s going? I thought we were friends?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We are, and I’d love to stay, but I can’t. I have a very important task which I can’t neglect.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lilinor bowed down to me, clearly regretful that she would have to break her promise to me by leaving. After all a Dragon’s word meant a lot to them so it wasn’t easy for her to go back on her promise.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then will we be able to see eachother again sometime?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Of course, this ring, yes… with this ring I think I’ll be able to fulfill my promise.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, I think it would be best for the two of you to leave as soon as possible.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You’re right, come here Viezda.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master~”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Was it just me or did she become more forward after having released her people of the Blood Moon curse? Did she think that she no longer had any obligations to her race and could now pursue me wholeheartedly? I knew how she felt about me but my heart already belonged to another, so I tried my best to keep a certain emotional distance between us. Also, I’m curious about the curse which the Dark Elves suffered and how it came about. I’ll have to ask her about it sometime.’</i></strong></p>
<p>Shuuwong-–!</p>
<p>Just as I began activating the magic circle, I looked up to see Lilinor’s sad face.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why are you so sad?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When we next meet, we might no longer be on the same side, I’m sorry.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Looking up at me apologetically one last time, she turned around and disappeared into the forest as I activated the magic circle.</p>
<p>Shuuing!</p>
<p><strong><i>“Little ones, you came back so soon.”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was the Titan Damascus which welcomed us. The gentle face and kind soft voice he spoke to us in wasn’t consistent with his giant and terrifying size.</p>
<p><strong><i>“We will have to be in your care for the next little while.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s isn’t a problem for you to stay here and enjoy my garden, so long as you come in peace.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I temporarily need a place to stay, is it okay if I build myself a house on the lower floor?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“It’s fine even if you want to build it here, it seems</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>We followed behind him as he led the way to the magic array leading to the next floor.</p>
<p>When we arrived in the floor where we had hunted the Hell Hounds, we walked around before finding a suitable location.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What do you think about building our house over here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I looks like a good spot.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, is there someway for you to assist us in building the house?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master who is it that you are talking to?”</i></strong> I often catch you mumbling to yourself and the name Lena comes up a lot, who is she?”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh it’s nothing, Lena is simply some sort of magical assistant.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“ I tried to gloss over it with a simple explanation and she seemed to buy it.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Building the house yourself wouldn’t be a simple task, I’d recommend creating a construction Android which would do the task for you.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I liked Lena’s idea and spent the next few days using my Material Creation to prepare all the necessary components for the Android. We occasionally had to go hunting for food, but usually it wasn’t a big problem because Damascus was glad to share the honey he collected from his bees.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we camped out in a roughly made tent. Sure it wasn’t nearly as comfortable as a real bed, but it was better than nothing. Also the Hell Hounds which we had previously exterminated would respawn periodically, and would be our main source of meat. This outdoor lifestyle brought Viezda and I closer.</p>
<p>After about a months time, my four construction Androids had built me an impressive manor at the edge of the misty forest. We had used the forest to build the house, and since it had remained untouched for centuries, the tall and thick oak trees made for great timber. The foundation was made out of poured cement which we created using Lime found in the ground, resulting in a modern looking human building.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, the good thing is I won’t be affecting history much this way since others can’t access the dungeon to see all these marvels of technology used in its construction.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although we were living a secluded life in the dungeon, we had access to every amenity one could think of.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm, it’s almost time to meet up with Daryl. Viezda, now that our house is built, I’ll head out by myself.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ye…yes…”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt that Viezda was quite disappointed. For the last month and a half we had spent most of our time together, so it would be strange now to be apart.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s okay I’ll be back before you know it.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If it’s just the two of us, you don’t need to call me Master.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… yes… Johra….”</i></strong></p>
<p>She struggled to use my name as she blushed heavily. I simply patted her head and looked at the house we had just built.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena is there anything missing?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“All the essentials are done, but how about preparing an Android maid?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, why didn’t I think of that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If the quality of the construction is high then it would be almost indistinguishable from a real human.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, but what about the energy to power it?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The generator which we had created last time is sufficient.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay then let’s get started.”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 98</p>
<p>For Viezda this house we built was like one out of a fairytale. What other than magic could have allowed for such a manor that has never before been built in the past thousands of years.</p>
<p>About ten days later, it was finally completed. From the outside it appeared like an old medieval structure. There were a total of four floors above ground, but it extended deep into the ground with 20 floors of basement. The above ground which was decorated in a medieval style was what we presented to others. Underground it was different, and was based largely off Gammasium, running completely on nuclear power.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda, what do you think about our new home?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you Master, doing all this for me.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, it is my dream home, but I wouldn’t able to build it anywhere but inside this dungeon.”</i></strong></p>
<p>KKiiiiiiiiiiiiicc</p>
<p>I opened the front door and welcomed in an emotional Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It is constantly defended by the Rohim’s energy shield.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ji weeng—!</p>
<p>As soon as we stepped in the shield activated, and since the Hellhounds weren’t able to break through it, our home had become a safe zone.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Good job Lena.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Welcome Master.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Two maids come to welcome us at the door entrance. Naturally they weren’t real maids but androids which we had created. One was more humanoid, while the other had cat-like features. They introduced themselves as Delaila and Hannah.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is this what kind of taste you have Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course, the cat tail and ears, I love fantasy.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Shaking my head we continued past the main entrance, but was instantly rooted in place by the breathtaking sight.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow”</i></strong></p>
<p>Likewise, Viezda had her mouth wide open after seeing the glittering interior. She had never seen such opulence. The room which we had just come upon was based on medieval decoration, but it was truly over the top.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena isn’t this a bit too much? I mean, just the upkeep….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, the Android take care of it all, the process is completely automated.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well….”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda was completely enthralled, going from room to room like a child on an adventure. I already knew most of what was inside, but still did the rounds to see the finishing touches.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm underground is almost all Gammasium?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, my A.I. abilities are fully functional in here. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What about the android making machine?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yup, and we also have a greenhouse built to grow the seeds which Johra has been collecting.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh those were the seeds which I had gotten from Damascus in the floor above us.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, and after some genetic modifications, they will bear fruit quicker so we can be sustainable in the near future.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Truly?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“This kind of genetic modifications</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thanks again Lena, you’re always a big help.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No problem, would you like to come here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Where is that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It can be considered as the core of the manor, and is the place where the atomic power which you have synthesized resides. Later we can refurbish it in order to function off your positron energy which would be more efficient.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do we need the enhanced output?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, all the previous construction androids have be refurbished into mining one’s and are constantly at work discovering new and rare minerals.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Great, well if you need me to create any resources then just let me know”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yup, also the Rohim shield can run indefinitely on the current power generator so we are prepared for any eventuality.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well that’s good….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“And there are the two surprises which I have yet to mention.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Please follow the lights on the ground.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After walking for a short while I came upon a pleasant surprise.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are these all hot springs Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, my sister used to think this was too extravagant, but I don’t agree. There are 40 different pools with varying temperatures and styles, along with a large 50 meter pool and a whirlpool to boot.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When did you manage to build this? I had no idea!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course it was done secretly in order to surprise you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh… if you had time for something like this then the construction could have been done much sooner.”</i></strong></p>
<p>While I grumbled at Lena’s priorities, I heard a peculiar sound,</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is over here?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I heard Viezda’s voice appear from behind.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“It is a hot springs bath area.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What are hot springs?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“They are….”</i></strong></p>
<p>Before I could continue, Hanna, the Android with cat ears spoke up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hot springs are baths where the water is warmed by the geothermal energy found underground. The water contains several minerals which help you relax and relieve the fatigue from your body. This area contains 40 different pools for your convenience. Please change and use these.”</i></strong></p>
<p>She handed us our bathing suits, mine was a speedo while Viezda was given a bikini.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey… you were awfully prepared weren’t you? Viezda! Don’t just change in front of me… I’ll step outside.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s okay if it’s Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Leaving the room I went to change in the hallway.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘I’m a virgin so these kinds of situations are quite awkward.’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra it appears that Viezda is quite interested in taking the next step with you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It can’t happen because my heart is already promised to another.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“According to many books, there isn’t any law forcing you into monogamy. She is your slave, so there is nothing</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I’ve always considered Viezda as a colleague and never thought of her as my slave.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Such a pity that you don’t take advantage of your position. I think this personality of yours is your greatest weakness. Throughout history, heroes who can’t conquer women often die young.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You don’t need to give me any advice on this matter, I’ll be fine.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes sir, as you say.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Returning to the bathhouse after changing into my speedo, I saw Viezda waiting for me in her bikini.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is this how I should wear a bikini Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Her voluptuous body would for the most part be masked by the leather armor she constantly wore, but her bikini now exposed her generous curves in all the right places. Putting aside her milky white skin and fit body which were a result of her evolution to a Moon Elf, she sported large D cups which were quite the burden to bear for such a slender frame.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda, you’re amazing… I just don’t know where to look.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I averted my gaze to stop myself from staring.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m glad someone thinks I’m beautiful.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, you’re free form that curse now, so everyone can appreciate your great beauty, have some more confidence. Shall we step into one of these springs?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Whaaa!</p>
<p>Walking towards me Viezda almost slipped on the floor and I caught her at the last second.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry about that Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all, the floor is a bit slippery so be careful.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The maid with cat ears had an awkward expression, maybe this whole situation had been engineered by Lena.</p>
<p>After catching the falling Viezda to prevent her from falling, my little guy began acting up, as a reaction to holding such a beautiful woman wearing just a bikini in my arms.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I feel something hard touching me Johra, are you okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m fine… it’s nothing. How about we enjoy those hot springs.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lifting her up into a princess carry, it became obvious how hard I had gotten down there. Behind me the maid in cat ears gave me the thumbs up, which only made me more nervous.</p>
<p>Splash!</p>
<p>Climbing into the nearest one I laid her gently into the warm water. This spring was one of moderate temperature so revelled in it’s comforts.</p>
<p>Yoohoo</p>
<p>Viezda let out a strange sound while I sighed in relief.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hooh… it’s been a long time since I’ve had a proper bath!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You both are pretty dirty, so let’s change it into a bubble bath instead.”</i></strong></p>
<p>With a gesture from Hannah who was standing by, large bubbles and foam soon began to appear in the water.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh it had a bubble bath function?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra are we under attack?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“No</p>
<p><strong><i>“No Viezda, it’s simply because we are quite dirty and need a good cleaning.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Frightened by the sudden appearance of bubbles, she had jumped into my arms like a scared kitten. The feeling of her soft chest pressing against me was truly heavenly.</p>
<p>That naughty guy down there immediately stood up once again, truly putting me in a bind.</p>
<p>‘No, No, Don’t rub your body, hold on.. control…”</p>
<p>Viezda was still a bit jumpy from all the bubbles, so I stroked her head to calm her down.</p>
<p>The cat eared maid once again flashed me a thumbs up, while I stared back at her helplessly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra I’ll try to create the mood, kukuku~”</i></strong></p>
<p>Following her bizarre laughter, the lights around us were dimmed, while only our hot spring was bathed in golden light.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jora why did it get dark all of a sudden, and are those stars in the ceiling?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve simulated an outdoor environment. From the stars which are constellations one could expect to see outside at the moment, to a small breeze and the smell of fresh leaves in the spring.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Lena….’</i></strong></p>
<p>She spoke to me through bone conduction so I’d be the only one to hear her. Viezda was still in my arms as we sat comfortably in our private bubble bath, the stars shining above us.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I am so happy to spend such a wonderful time with you Johra, I will never forget this moment.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Faced with her expression of pure bliss, all my safety guards in place melted away.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda….”</i></strong></p>
<p>Looking into my eyes and understanding my thoughts, she pressed her lips to mine.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You don’t need to say anything, I’m simply Johra’s slave. I’d do anything for you, and the fact that you want me is more than enough.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda’s body which was pressed up against me was so soft and lovely, all sense of reasoning went out through the window.</p>
<p>We began with a light kiss, and a jolt of ecstasy coursed through my body. That clear line which I had repeatedly told myself I’d never cross disappeared altogether.</p>
<p>I lost track of how much time we spent in those hot springs, indulging in carnal pleasures. Simply a man and a woman, glued to each other as if time around us stopped moving.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Playboy｠]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Father of Mysterious｠]</i></strong></p>
<p>At some point we were both too exhausted and collapsed on eachother. Lena had the androids move us to the bedroom, which was Lena’s second surprise.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This Lena… Finally I did it! Seems like a strange title appeared.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I descended into my very own nightmare, wracked with both the guilt and blissfulness of my latest lovemaking.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You are out of control”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Well..yes. But</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well..yes. But I don’t regret it. I love Viezda.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What about Valerno?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I love her too.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that even an excuse, isn’t she your future wife?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s your plan?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t know.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“크크크 Are you dodging the question?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Anyway since you are one step closer to fulfilling our promise, I’ll give you hint.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hint?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. You need to recruit the services of one who is close to the High Gods. It is the only way to keep your promise.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What promise! Who are you?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Me? I guess you know who I am now right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You are….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hahaha wake up! Before the pretty baby starts crying.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I woke up following that creepy laughter. After opening my eyes Viezda was fast asleep, using my arm as a pillow</p>
<p>JJock</p>
<p>Staring at her lovely face I couldn’t help but lightly kiss her on the forehead.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jo..hra did you sleep well?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yea”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda’s shyness was even cuter. Despite having fully experienced each other just the night before, did it all get reset the next morning?”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can we stay like this a little longer?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure”</i></strong></p>
<p>Blushing madly as I held her in my arms, she basked in my tender embrace like a frail and delicate flower.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘She is so small.’</i></strong></p>
<p>Crouched up into a ball against me, she appeared so small and lovely. The day flashed by as we stayed in bed together, sometimes kissing, other times whispering words of love to each other.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra didn’t you have an appointment to keep?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, being with you is the most important thing for me right now.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t tease me!”</i></strong></p>
<p>We spent the next few days much the same, rolling around together in bed. We had the androids to cook and Hannah would bring us food periodically.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra you should really get going. I don’t want to be the reason that you fail to keep a promise.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“…”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had no way to refute her. I was beginning to feel the dauntless pressure of all these tasks I had to complete.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I’ll simply prioritize spending time with Viezda and…”</i></strong></p>
<p>She simply pressed her finger to my lips.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, I don’t need to know everything that is going on with you right now. I’m satisfied with being your little Viezda, so simply come visit me when you can, I will be waiting in this house.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Seeing her resolute expression I knew she had made up her mind. Despite being the master of the house i had in some strange way been kicked out by Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay I’ll get going.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll always be here waiting for you, so take care of your stuff and then be sure to visit me no matter what.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I teleported over to the library inthe counts mansion, leaving behind a somewhat unwilling Viezda.</p>
<p>Zzing</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 99</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why has the Count’s manor been burned to the ground?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Clearly the place I had just teleported to was the magic circle in the Count’s library, but there was nothing but a scorched building in sight. Exploring further I noticed that the village at the foot of the manor had likewise suffered the same fate.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What…happened?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I run at full speed towards Gartmar, It was already sunset, so no one could recognize me. In under an hour I had arrived before the Mayor’s home.</p>
<p>Knock Knock!</p>
<p><strong><i>“Who is it?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Mayor it is Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… so now you choose to show up?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Opening the door he welcomed me in, as if he had been waiting all along. He had an open bottle on the table and seemed to already be quite tipsy.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Mayor are you drunk?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, this is nothing.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt his eyes squinting in anger.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s happened here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Count Sion was captured as a traitor.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t believe it. There was not reason for him to betray his country.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You see, with enough power one can decide what is true and what is false.”</i></strong></p>
<p>My hands balled into a fist.</p>
<p><strong><i>“And what about those living in the manor?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“The Count himself was whipped and burned at the stake to set an example. His family members and servants were either killed or sold into slavery. One can’t even consider coming to their rescue because there are simply too many guards watching over them, you won’t make it out alive.</p>
<p>The mayor was trying to test my resolve.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you think I am afraid about them?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then will you rebel?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The glint in his eyes betrayed his tone, clearly it was something had he had already considered.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Who was behind this? Tell me all you know about the location they are being held and who is guarding them.”</i></strong></p>
<p>He handed me some documents filled with related information, then tossed me some gold coins</p>
<p>Ting!</p>
<p><strong><i>“You didn’t get this from me.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course, you have nothing to worry about.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m not worried, because if you fail, then I won’t hesitate to rebel.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back, probably the reason that the mayor was so depressed was that his next decision would have a huge impact on the lives of all his citizens.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s get going.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Just as I left his house I took off running. In this day and age there was no available method of transportation faster than me sprinting. Unless you were using teleportation magic then you wouldn’t be able to keep up with my current speed.</p>
<p>At my peak I could run somewhere between 300 and 400 kilometers per hour. Everything would turn into a blur as I ran in a straight line, crushing anything unfortunate enough</p>
<p>My destination was the royal slave market. I arrived there after about an hour and used my spider webs against a building to slow down my speed, landing atop the castle and looking around.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I should start over there.”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was the slave shop I had spotted in the middle of the large market.</p>
<p>Circling around the back I set up a teleportation array on the back of the store as a precaution, then asked Lena.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can we take a look inside and see if there is anyone connected to the Count.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There seem to be five former servants, all sleeping at the moment. I’ll project their positions on your cornea.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I discreetly entered the slave shop, rescued the five and kidnapped the worker there for good measure. Firing up the Magic array I teleported them all back to our manor in the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you Johra, but please save the Count’s children instead of us lowly servants. The Count is already dead but we must save his two kids.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry about anything and simply have a good rest. Viezda, when this slave trader wakes up make sure he breaks the slavery contract with those five.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s going on? Why are the Count’s servants….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s a long story, Just trust in me. I need to head back now.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok, leave this to me.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Great, thanks!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I teleported back to the Slave’s market.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra if you find some highground I can map out this part of the city.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good”</i></strong></p>
<p>Using my spiderman abilities I climbed to the top of a watchtower.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This Royal slave market is quite large, but I’ve managed to identify the remaining 8 slaves connected to the Count’s household.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Using the same tactics as last time, I managed to rescue them all during the course of the night.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That voice, it’s sir Johra right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it you….”</i></strong></p>
<p>Both Jillian and Jerna were blind, having both of their eyes burned out. The moment I saw what pitiful state they were in, I couldn’t hold back the tears from streaming down my face. I had been in the dungeon while all this had gone down, otherwise I would have been able to prevent this from happening.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry Jillian, Jerna.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all master, instead we were able to have some hope simply by the fact that you hadn’t been captured yet.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian tried to speed objectively but I could feel the warmth through his words. Likewise Jerna’s joy from seeing me went without saying.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, let’s get you all to a safe place now.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Capturing their slave master I activate the teleportation array.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Young master!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Miss!”</i></strong></p>
<p>As soon as the Count’s servants saw the two kids they ran up and</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll prepare artificial eyeballs.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that possible?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It shouldn’t take too long. The eyelids are easy enough to replicate, and although the cornea is a bit trickier, it should be fine. Please prepare some materials which I need. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, Let’s do that right away.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena’s voice which was transmitted through Hannah lifted everyone’s spirits.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Will we be able to see again?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna asked in a trembling voice.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, no matter how hard the procedure is I’ll do my best.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How..how is it possible?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry, I’ll make sure it comes true. Also, I’ll get those slave masters to release you from your contracts.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t think it is possible to erase a slavery contract though, perhaps only someone on the level of a God would be able to.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“According to past historical records he’s right.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then is there no way at all?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I should be possible if they are in turn enslaved to you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s do that, I wouldn’t want them to live their entire lives as slaves.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The captured slave masters seemed to have been rebellious at first, but had been properly educated by Viezda, judging by their numerous bruises and general swolleness around their body.</p>
<p><strong><i>“All of you will transfer your slaves to Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yess… Yes!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Unable to refute Viezda’s commands, they enslaved themselves to me and then handed over all their slaves which were connected to the Count’s household. A total of fifteen, thirteen workers and the two kids.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda, time to take out the trash.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh No!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We aren’t guilty, we’ve complied fully with your requests!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ignoring their helpless pleading, she threw them over her shoulder and tossed them into the forest infested with Hell Hounds, never to be seen again.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra the medical wing is prepped, may I begin the procedure on the children?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Will you begin the surgery immediately?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It should first take about two days to artificially create them a cornea.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, Jerna and Jillian, follow these to maids to receive some treatment.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes…”</i></strong></p>
<p>The two kids followed obediently behind the android maids.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra can we stay here?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was the previous steward of the manor. I could see the pain and anger hidden in his eyes following the tragedy that had just occurred.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course, any friend of the Count is mine as well, you can stay here as my guest for as long as you’d like.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can’t simply impose on your kindness, I will take charge of the housework.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“In just a few hours we should have a new android which we can use to show them around and set up some tasks.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Then I welcome you as my chief steward. Please wait here for a moment, there will soon be</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you sir Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Having handled everything at home, I teleported back to the slave market to go after the big fish.</p>
<p>I was able to find his mansion due to the intel I had received from Gartmar’s mayor.</p>
<p><strong><i>“He has quite the debt to settle after all the anger he has caused me”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was like the reaper of death, travelling through the darkness of the the Royal slave market.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I hope you are having a nice dream, because from now on out you’ll only be feeling despair.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Kiiiiiicc</p>
<p>The Marquess of Leon closed the window to her bedroom and joined the Marquis on their bed.</p>
<p>Shoot Shoo</p>
<p>I easily captured all fourteen of their household, and tied them all up in spider webs before transferring them back to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Whoop whoo</p>
<p>Leon and his obese body stared at me angrily as he struggled to break free. The Count’s servants stood to the side watching with cold eyes.</p>
<p>Steward, please see to it that no misfortune falls upon these people. Jillian and Jerna should have the right to take their revenge when they recuperate. For now there are several rooms on the ground floor that could accommodate them.</p>
<p>An android with puppy-like Saint Bernard ears appeared along with the steward. It seemed that Lena had thing for these animal cosplays.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is your name?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It is Riley, sir Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Nodding back to Riley, I left the prisoners in their hands.</p>
<p>“Viezda, help our Steward.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I made my way back to Gartmar, but despite it being quite late, the mayor had yet to go to sleep.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Knock Knock!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Come in, was there any missing information form last time?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shook my head, the mayor had already sobered up from his previous drinking episode.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I came to report that I’ve completed the task.”</i></strong></p>
<p>His eyes popped wide open in surprise, before nodding as if having understood something.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Although it’s best if you don’t show yourself throughout the kingdom in the future, but none will know of your great deeds.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That doesn’t matter.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I feel bad, like I’m always in your debt.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Mayor, was the marquis the one behind all this?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe, but it is likely that Miriam was the one pulling the strings.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So it is him again.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you kill Leon?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I don’t want to give him such an easy death, but don’t worry they won’t be coming back.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, and what about the survivors from the Count’s household?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“They will likewise not reappear in this kingdom, but worry not as they are all safe and well.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… it is somewhat hard to believe that you have accomplished so much in such a short period of time.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back.”</p>
<p>Johra,</p>
<p>I nodded back.”</p>
<p>Johra, are you a Messiah for a High God?”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m not quite sure what to make of you though….Once again, you are responsible for saving so many lives. Tell me if ever you need my help and I’ll do my utmost to support you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I wish the Mayor success and happiness for you and your family.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, thank you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“This is goodbye then.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Won’t we see each other again?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm perhaps, but I doubt that you’d recognize me.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Saying our quick goodbyes I left the mayor’s house with a heavy heart. I already knew that his family would die sometime in the near future.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Should I return to save them, or would it change the timeline too much? I’ve already had quite a big impact, so just where lies the line that I shouldn’t cross?’</i></strong></p>
<p>I feel the heavy burden of the future weighing on my shoulders, but my priority is saving the people whom I love. I simply can’t around righting every wrong.</p>
<p><strong><i>“The Balkan empire huh? Aren’t they those guys which came up with a solution to create Chimeras, are they developing it right now?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was making my way towards them and quickly arrived at the border. They had built an imposing wall to seperate the Balkan and Mirin Kingdom, but it wasn’t nearly tall enough to keep me out.</p>
<p>Tak</p>
<p>I crossed into a forest, far away from any border garrison and patrols, before heading towards a nearby village, arriving there just as the sun began to rise in the horizon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I recommend taking it slow and collecting information first, Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay. That’s good idea. Miriam shouldn’t be on the run and most likely feels safe within these borders. He doesn’t expect anyone to be chasing him into the Balkan empire. Well, if he got news of the Marquis’ latest demise he might be more careful, but it wouldn’t do him any good regardless. 크크크”</i></strong></p>
<p>I instinctively let out a creepy laugh</p>
<p>Although it was never my plan to affect history much, he had to pay for his misdeeds. If you went after anyone I was close to, I would return the favor one thousandfold. It was simply my way of doing things.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jir store, isn’t that a subsidy of Miriam’s family enterprise? Should I start there?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I instead visited a competitor.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hello, is anyone there?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Who is it so early in the morning? We aren’t open yet.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Tak</p>
<p>I threw him a pouch full of gold and the clerks expression changed in an instant.</p>
<p><strong><i>“My name’s Ben and I’m the manager of this store What can I help you with?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m looking to buy some information, would it be possible to trade?”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 100</p>
<p><strong><i>“Follow me.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The clerk who had introduced himself as Ben led me to a dark, secluded room in the back. Inside sat a guy who looked like some astrology gipsy after removing his hood.</p>
<p>Kung</p>
<p><strong><i>“This room is protected by a magic spell to prevent others from eavesdropping on our conversation. You can go ahead and ask him anything you’d like.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Just who is he?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… you’ve never heard of them? They are a special kind of slave which are used in the business of buying and selling of information. They are very useful because their minds can be connected across long distances allowing for an exchange of information.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“And you can guarantee discretion?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Naturally, any information regarding a client is secure.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, then I’d like to know everything you have on the Jir company and Miriam.”</i></strong></p>
<p>For a split second I saw Ben’s expression turn livid, but he quickly regained his composure.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you get that Marion? Everything about Jir and Miriam.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The man named Marion was blue skinned and peculiar silver eyes. He began chanting a mantra and closed his eyes for a while before speaking up.</p>
<p>“The one known as Miriam is actually Ardal Vermillion Tor, the second Prince of the empire. He’s only recently returned from a task of espionage in a neighboring country. There is also some news that that the third Prince has made several attempts on his life.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hm… so he was a Prince.’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sir, unfortunately the information you’ve learned today outweighs your earlier payment.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ben motioned to me, holding the pouch of gold I had given him.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, we never met each other.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I tossed him another one filled with even more gold and headed towards the exit.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dear customer, please come back anytime. Also, as a courtesy I shall show you the way to Prince Ardal’s palace.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t help but chuckle at Ben’s sudden change in attitude. Like a true merchant, he would always value a paying customer. After allowing Ben to instruct me how to get to the palace, I made my way through the mountainous path.</p>
<p>It took me about half a day’s travel before the palace came into sight. I circled around to the hill and drew a teleportation array behind a large rock. I then spent the rest of the day checking out their security measures.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, please highlight the Prince and any other notable figures.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll display it on your cornea at once.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The prince was located on the highest terrasse, in the center of the palace. It was the most secure location, and I figured that Ichan and the rest of his crew would likely be stationed near him.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I should start by cutting off the head of the snake.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Shuu!</p>
<p>My spider web allowed be</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hm, is that some Magic detection trap?’</i></strong></p>
<p>Right near the door my Spider Senses began tingling, allowing my to easily sidestep the trap. Had it not been for that, an alarm would have undoubtedly sounded, resulting in quite the mess.</p>
<p>Shuu shhu</p>
<p>Silently entering the room I shot out a few Web Shots, effectively binding his arms and feet. Having caught the Prince unawares, he was unable to form any resistance.</p>
<p>Hoisting him up, I whisked him away and made my escape. I then returned to the rock on the hill and teleported back to our dungeon manor.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda was there, kneeling down on the ground.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why would you be there on your knees? It doesn’t look very comfortable.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I thought it would be a good posture to wait for you in, who is that man you are carrying?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He is the one who is behind this entire mess.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Letting out an evil grin I carried him to a secluded room on the ground floor before heading back to the Prince’s Palace.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I might as well grab Ichan and Carline. Those guys are bad news and have likely committed countless crimes throughout their adventures. It’d be best to take care of them for a better future.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The kidnapping went off without a hitch. They were both fast asleep and had their defenses down, not to mention that I had reached such a level that very few mortals could resist.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Kidnapper in the Dark｠]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hey, that title is a bit much….’</i></strong></p>
<p>Having knocked both of them unconcious, I swung them up on each shoulder and bolted threw the forest, towards my teleportation circle.</p>
<p>“These will be the last ones.</p>
<p>After sending the two of them through, I crushed the rock into several pieces so as to not leave behind any evidence. Anyways it had already gotten to a point that a greater part of our dungeon manor was housing prisoners locked in spider webs.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, I’ll leave it to you to take care of those guys, just make sure they spit out any information they have first.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, I’ll convert Riley into interrogator mode and report to you when it’s done.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda asked me with curious face.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So, is it all over now?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had been going back and forth so much that I had forgotten my original purpose.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Not yet, I still have small thing left to take care of.”</i></strong></p>
<p>She shooed head, knowing me she understand that it wouldn’t remain a small matter.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then I’ll see you next time.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Using the teleportation array I reappeared in the ruins</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh right, I wasn’t supposed to show my face again in this kingdom.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, did you want me to use a hologram to hide your appearance.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that even possible?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes I can make your face appear different, or at the very least incredibly hard to recognize.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, with a different appearance it should all go smoother.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then when you enter the city I’ll project it.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, we still have some time then I might as well get some sleep.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I took a short nap, lying down in the ashes of the Count’s manor, before heading towards Gartmar.</p>
<p>Life was blooming all around me as Spring was well underway, but my thoughts were very dark, occupied with the misfortune which my good friend the Count had suffered.</p>
<p><strong><i>“In the future I should keep my interactions with others down to a minimum.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Having come to the decision, I made my way to Darryl’s bakery, and only had Lena power off the hologram once I was inside.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Long time no see!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh! Johra, how are you doing?”</i></strong></p>
<p>We gave each other a big hug. All the while a little girl stood silently behind him, grasping his sleeve.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Come here Ian, say hello to Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I…..an?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hello , I am Ian.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“She suffered from a traumatic experience, that’s why she doesn’t speak very fluently.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No…no problem…”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was truly shocked, stuttered and was unable to respond properly. So many thoughts were racing through my mind.</p>
<p><strong><i>“If that’s Ian, what will happen later on?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘This is the worst possible case. By influencing Ian’s future I could very well be putting mine in peril as well. How could I get out of this?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Darryl let’s step outside for a second.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Pulling him to the side I spoke to him in a hushed tone.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I have some very important matters to take care of, so I don’t think I’ll be able to meet you again for quite some time. I’ve gotten a pretty decent reward for my last quest, so please take this money and give Ian a better life, away form this city.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I hand him a bag full of precious gems, it held enough of a fortune to ensure that he wouldn’t need to work another day in his life.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No need Johra, it seems like the situation you were in hasn’t been resolved yet, and we can live just fine the two of us without the money. Take care of yourself first.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I shook my head. There would be greater dangers coming my way, and I had to distance myself from Ian’s child version.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I have plenty more, please accept this small amount Darryl.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Seeing my resolute expression, he finally caved and accepted the pouch.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You have to leave immediately?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah”</i></strong></p>
<p>Warag!</p>
<p>He hugged me tightly and said.</p>
<p>“Even though we might</p>
<p><strong><i>“Take care brother.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Taking my leave I instructed Lena to fire up the hologram.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Please disguise my face.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Got it.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Testing the disguise on a few acquaintances in the market, it became clear to me that it was quite effective.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Excuse me, are you miss Anne?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but how do you know my name?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m doing the bidding of someone who knows you well.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“An acquaintance?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jingle jingle</p>
<p>I pull out a small pouch filled with a few gold coins.</p>
<p><strong><i>“A friend named Johra asked me to give this to you as a goodbye present”</i></strong></p>
<p>She opened the pouch and upon seeing the shiny gold color, immediately tried to return it to me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I’ve never done anything to deserve all this, I can’t accept it.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Please take it, otherwise I’ll be in quite the bind.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What? Mom, who’s this uncle?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“This is a friend of Johra”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ah is he an adventurer now? I was wondering if he was doing well. How is he?”</p>
<p>The future Adventurer’s guild receptionist asked me with wide eyes</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well. Yes kind of.”</i></strong></p>
<p>She asked more questions after seeing my awkward response.</p>
<p><strong><i>“How do you know him?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“We are very close, closer than anyone</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm? Do you love each other?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No it’s not like that! I’m already engaged with someone.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Since she was unable to accept any of my excuses I had no choice but to show her my ring in order for her not to misunderstand, I didn’t want her to think I was gay.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can you accept this pouch on Anne’s behalf?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Rina don’t!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hehe~ its fine. Since the uncle adventurer was going to give it one way or another.”</i></strong></p>
<p>As I was crouched down to give her the pouch, she patted my head with a knowing expression.</p>
<p>JJokk</p>
<p>She suddenly jumped up and kissed my cheek.</p>
<p>“This is my gift to the begger adventurer. Tell him I’ll thank him I’ll thank him properly when I’m older.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Pedophile｠]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah…I’ll let him know.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I left the market in a hurry, sporting an awkward expression.</p>
<p>‘What kind of title is this? I’m not a pedophile.</p>
<p>I began to cry in shame, but no matter how much I complained or how many tears I wept, the title didn’t disappear.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Why!!!!!!!!!!’</i></strong></p>
<p>I finally I stopped running when I arrived before the slave market.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Uhm, actually I had some business to take care of here, let’s look around.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I opened the door and showed myself in.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Excuse me sir, How can I help you?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The manager or the slave market welcomed me with a beaming smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you have any unique slaves?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What would you characterize as unique?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Johra, The slaves you are</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Thanks Lena.’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Im looking for either Dark Elves, Half-Dragons, Half-Nosferatu or Lycans. Do you have any slaves from those races?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“These days there don’t seem to be any Dark Elves around, and I haven’t heard of the other three races which you’ve mentioned.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, then can you show me what your stock is like?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Sifting through the slaves of all three Slave traders in town, I finally found a hidden gem.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘A High Elf in a place like this?’</i></strong></p>
<p>Her appearance was that of a blind kid, but in actuality she was a High Elf. Perhaps she was using some variant of polymorph or illusion which only I could see through, but I acted like I was ignorant of the fact.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… what about that kid over there?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Him? We haven’t had the time to properly educate her since she’s just arrived, will that be fine? There is also no guarantee regarding her… health issues.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How much?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I tossed him a pouch of gold coins. He caught it and after checking the contents inside instantly agreed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This is enough, we can write up the contract immediately.”</i></strong></p>
<p>And so I had purchased a High Elf masquerading as a human.</p>
<p><strong><i>“My name is Melpomene, and as you can see I can’t see and therefore has some trouble getting around.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not problem, nice to meet you Melpomene”</i></strong></p>
<p>Having gained possession of the contract, I left the slave market together with my latest acquisition.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… I think it’d be best if we get you a decent pair of shoes.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Truly?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I gave her a piggyback ride and headed to the only cobbler in town.</p>
<p><strong><i>“We are looking for a comfortable pair of shoes, bring out your best quality.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure, are these shoes for your slave?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, is there something wrong?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all, then I guess you’d want to look at a cheaper selection instead right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, didn’t you hear me just ask for your best ones?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The store owner stare at me, dumbfounded for a good five seconds before snapping back to it. In this day an age I was certainly a strange customer.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What do you think Melpomene?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t mind, anything is fine.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, then how much are these?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Four silvers, sir.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Here you go.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Helping her to put on her shoes, I then grab her by the hand to lead the way.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Now let’s get you outfitted with some new clothes, okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p>She blushes momentarily and replies in a shy voice.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Isn’t it still daytime?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title:StudHorse｠]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hey! That wasn’t at all my meaning! What is up with all these strange titles!’</i></strong></p>
<p>My complaints fell on deaf ears and my shameful titles weren’t going anywhere.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Damn’</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 101</p>
<p>After guiding Melpomene to a clothes store, I spoke to Lena.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Would it be possible to cure Melpomene’s eyes?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, it’s quite complicated because she’s lost her eyesight for quite some time, so it’s likely that even her brain has been affected and not just certain nerves. Trying to replace it with an artificial eyeball is almost impossible.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are there any other solutions?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There are a few, but the chances of success are quite low.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine if it can’t be helped.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After some time she came out in a brand spanking new outfit. However she seemed a bit out of place considering that she hadn’t bathed in quite some time.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sounds reasonable.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After settling the price with the clerk, we left Gartmar behind.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master where are we heading? This no longer smells like the city.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, that’s because I’m taking you to my house.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… so in the end you are taking me there?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[StudHorse level 1 ➢ 2]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Ugh, not that again….’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why is it that what you think about when I mention my home?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I thought that the only reason one would buy a blind child like me was that you had some special fetish.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Fetish Lv 1｠]</i></strong></p>
<p>‘What! Why did another stupid title come out? At least give me a chance to explain myself!’ <strong><i>“Not at all, I already have a future partner as well my beloved.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh? You already have more than one woman?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[StudHorse level 2 ➢ 3]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No… that’s…. ugh!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shook my head and simply quit digging my own grave. Whatever I said was bound to create a misunderstanding at this point.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Anyways let’s head to my place, I have some things to take care of.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ha, just as I expected you just wanted to lure me back to your house!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[StudHorse level 3 ➢ 4]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘I have to endure….’</i></strong></p>
<p>Grabbing her hand, I quickly created a teleportation array in this secluded forest.</p>
<p>Shhoot</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, where is this place? Just a few moments ago I could smell the nature and trees of a forest, but suddenly it smell like metal…”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Welcome home Master”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You arrived Johra!”</i></strong></p>
<p>As we arrived, the former Count’s servants and Viezda were waiting for us.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why would you be here waiting?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It is our most important task.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shook my head, then caught Viezda’s glaring stare.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, is that child your new slave?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I will stay with you in the future.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene answered with a strange smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“How about a bath? You can meet everyone else after you’ve washed yourself properly.”</i></strong></p>
<p>[StudHorse level 4</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Ugh!’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda please come and guide her.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had to dump this troublesome girl on Viezda’s lap as soon as possible, lest I max out on my StudHorse level.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why? Is it just coincidence I have new title when Melpomene says something.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena? How about taking a look at Melpomene’s eyes?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena who took control of the maid Delaila and joined the girls in the hot springs.</p>
<p>grumble~</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, dinner is ready.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Nice timing.”</i></strong></p>
<p>They had prepared a buffet to welcome me in the main hall at the steward’s instructions.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, how did you know when I was going to arrive?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I received the news from Lena”</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Ah, was he somehow able to get in touch with Lena? But how did they contact each</p>
<p>other, was the dungeon dimension somehow different? I’d have to ask Lena about it later.’</p>
<p>After having feasted on the buffet themed after Earth’s food, I summoned the maid Riley.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you get any information from Prince Ardal or the others?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think they should break by tomorrow at the latest. I’ll then collect all the information and report it to Lena.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, and the Count’s children?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“They should be undergoing surgery later this evening. We’ve already prepared the artificial eyeballs using stem cells and some materials you’ve provided. We are simply waiting for them to be in top health before beginning the procedure.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There shouldn’t be any problems right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed, the probability of failure is estimated to be just 0.1%”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, but make sure to do your best. I don’t want anything to go wrong, these kids have been through enough.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Understood.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Can I go visit them now?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I arrived to the medical wing to the sight of Hannah putting eye patches on both Jillian and Jerna, then had them hooked up with an IV. It was supposed to help stabilize their condition.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jillian, I heard you’ll undergo surgery later today.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but don’t worry about us master. Even if it isn’t successful we are already grateful that you’ve saved our lives.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian squeezed my hand but had a slight tremble.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Not it’s fine, I’ll make sure that you’re good as new. It’s the least I can do to repay the kindness which the Count has shown me. Not to mention that you’re also my disciple, so as your teacher I can’t fail you in this.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Neither of them had anything to add after that, but I could feel their determination.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll see you both tomorrow and you’ll both be healthy as an ox, okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah”</i></strong></p>
<p>Leaving</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah”</i></strong></p>
<p>Leaving the two kids behind, I decided to go back and visit the Royal slave market. It still remained a mystery as to what was going on in that kingdom.</p>
<p>Shoot</p>
<p>The magic array which I had created in the alley was still intact. Two days ago after having raided the Slaver’s market, I created a hidden teleportation array beneath a sewer lid which was the reason it had not yet been found.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh this smell… it isn’t even funny”</i></strong></p>
<p>The smell of the sewer where all the city’s garbage and filth gathered was beyond disgusting. I quickly got myself out of there and made my way into the city</p>
<p><strong><i>“Seems like they’ve upped the security around here, was it because of me?”</i></strong></p>
<p>There were even some soldiers patrolling through the alleys, in the distance I spotted a popular looking tavern.</p>
<p>Keeeiiiiikk</p>
<p>Walking into the tavern with the double saloon type doors, the was a crowd of people drinking and having a good time. The guards would occasionally enter and scan them for potential threats.</p>
<p>I sat down inconspicuously in a secluded corner.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What would you like to order?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Give me a pint of ale, along with some bread and ham.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I paid the man a silver for the meal and he soon returned with my food. The bread was somewhat stale and the ale was downright awful. In truth it was passable for this day and age, but when compared to the food which I’ve experienced I found it quite lacking. Still, I just climbed out of a disgusting sewer, so the food wasn’t all that bad in comparison.</p>
<p>Tearing off a piece of bread, I spoke to Lena.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, collect some information.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Already on it, I’ll give you a breakdown of what others are saying while you eat.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Across the bar there were fives thug with rough appearances who were gathered together, drinking and being quite rowdy. Lena amplified their conversation through my bone conduction.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Senior, was the royal princess truly behind the kidnapping of the Marquis? ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Shh, that is secret information that others are supposed to know.”</i></strong></p>
<p>It seemed that the elder looking fella was a royal palace guard. Those guards were all from the well known Phillips family , not only were they sworn to protect the royal family, but were also responsible for certain day to day affairs. Their influence differed from the nobles, but was still substantial.</p>
<p>“It’s caused quite the big commotion. First count</p>
<p><strong><i>“I heard a rumor that the princess visited Leon’s manor after the fact. It was also a known fact that the Prince also argued against Leon’s claim that Sion was a traitor. When certain evidence about Sion came to light, the Prince was shunned, which was why the Princess went to kidnap marquis Leon.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There’s another rumor that she is a witch.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The chess game which the Count introduced a short time ago has been linked to traitors and has now been outlawed. When she used to play that game she certainly appeared inhuman.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes that woman must be the one behind all this.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Without knowing I had clenched my fist and pushed down hard on the table. I had previously suspected that she had been behind the Count’s recent demise and was angry with myself for slandering her in mind because she had in fact been supporting him and suffered as a result.</p>
<p>Still, my current action had attracted to much unwanted attention. Looking down I realised that I had sunk the table into the ground by pushing down too hard on it. It was only possible because of the instantaneous force I had used and the sturdiness of the table.</p>
<p>The waiter, customers and both soldiers in and outside the pub had all turned to me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Geez, I’m in trouble now.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Taking out a pouch of gold, I tried to settle it peacefully by paying for reparations.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Catch him!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn it!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Turn around the corner and I’ll use the hologram to change your appearance.”</i></strong></p>
<p>With Lena’s help I was able to quickly lose the soldiers chasing me and headed to the royal palace.</p>
<p>Shuu!</p>
<p>Waited for night to fall before infiltrating the palace.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena can you track down the Princess for me?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Arriving outside of the prison cell she was being held in, I used Lena’s ability to see inside. She was standing pensively in the moonlight filtering in through the window. I was unable to read her expression.</p>
<p>Dulkung!</p>
<p><strong><i>“Who are you?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How did you even get here? Anyways you seem fine so at least there’s that.”</i></strong></p>
<p>She seemed worried for my sake. When we had last met she had appeared somewhat unreasonable, which was the reason I suspected her in the first place.</p>
<p>“There was some noise, everyone there must</p>
<p>I heard the shouts from the guards coming this way.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Princess, I apologize in advance for taking advantage of you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Just what are you planning on doing? You’ll just be labelled as a traitor.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I hoisted her up on my shoulder and replied.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are there different degrees of traitor? Hold on tight!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Shuu!</p>
<p>My Web Shot reached the large bell of the Cathedral which was the adjacent building.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is that!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ignoring her cries of surprise, I distanced us from the royal palace with a few more Web Shots, continuing for about a minute until I felt some warm liquid running down my shoulder.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Princess….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t ever tell anyone! I’ll declare any mention of what has happened just now as blasphemy!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I chuckled to myself seeing her blush in shame. It must have been quite the frightening ride along my Web Shots, so her reaction was not entirely unwarranted.</p>
<p>Leaving the Royal Capital behind, we headed back to the Dungeon through the use of a new Magic array.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you back already? Is that the princess, Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda and the steward were there to welcome me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, the surgery was successful and when they wake up I’ll let you know.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, I’ll have to ask you to help the princess clean up and get some new clothes.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After stepping through the array, she turned to examine herself. Red faced and ashamed, she quickly follow behind the cat-eared Hannah, following her towards the hot springs.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, I’ll prepare for the surgery on Melpomene.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok. Viezda, please prepare my clean clothes.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda was staring at me while I tried to get changed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda I’m trying to get changed here.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I know.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, if you’re looking while I change….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What are you worried about, I’ve already seen it all.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Seeing is one thing, but do you really need to watch?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm, just trying to refresh my memory, please let me watch.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I simply shook my head in defeat and got changed.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Pervert｠]</i></strong></p>
<p>“No! That’s not….’</p>
<p>At this point I had given up on all these new titles.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra will you sleep here today?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Her eyes were shining in anticipation.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Um, I guess.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll be waiting.”</i></strong></p>
<p>She disappeared after saying her piece.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why did that sound like a mandatory invitation?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I climbed up to the reception room on the ground floor and waited for the princess to arrive. She appeared about two hours later, led by my steward.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, just who are you?”</i></strong></p>
<p>She sat before me and aske right away.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘How should I answer her?’</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 102</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… it’s a bit hard to explain, it’s both a temporary look and at the same time the closest thing to my original appearance.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you not human?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I am, just not one from this world.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… so you’re a visitor from another world. I’ve heard many of such tales of legendary heroes coming from other dimensions.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I am not quite a hero, I might be the opposite in fact.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then are you evil?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Princess became somewhat afraid.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Evil… I’m probably not that since I’ve already killed evil in the past.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So what are you then? I just can’t seem to figure you out.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that so? Well, just look at me know, what you see is what you get.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“That seemed to help Princess Mayardus calm down, but her hands still had a slight tremble as she reached for her tea cup.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Was it a good thing for you to rescue me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What do you mean, that’s like the definition of a good deed.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but now I can no longer return to the palace thanks to your efforts. I’m like a fish that’s out of the water, waiting for my own death.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had already expected this from her. She was now averting her eyes, as if waiting for my response.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you a story from my homeworld. When I was young I used to have an aquarium in my house. I thought that my fish were small and cute, but later learned an interesting fact.</p>
<p>The size of a fish is determined by how large the waters they roam in are. If you release a fish from an aquarium into a big lake, then it can grow larger.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huu… that’s a funny story. Are you trying to say I should live in a bigger lake?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That was the metaphor.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then how big is this body of water that I’ll be living in, do I even have a choice in the matter?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Perhaps you can thrive in the largest of oceans, but the choice has to be made now. You can decide to take the first step, or continue to live out the remainder of your days, secluded in this manor of mine.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess’ eyebrows furrowed into a frown as she replied.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What kind of choice is that? Well, if you meant thriving in the largest of areas, then perhaps I’ll be a conqueror, Queen of the whole world!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Would you support me in that? Why does this feel like entering a contract with the Devil, or possibly a mythological god. Are you sure you’re not some kind of demon?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t think so. Truth be told I’ve never seen one, but I’m surprised you’d liken me to a god.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, back in time immemorial, gods banded</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t think so, after all what possible use would I have for your soul. I do however require you to make three promises.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Three? Why do I get the feeling that this is some kind of retaliation for the conditions of our chess match.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hahaha… not at all. In fact I was more than pleased with the key you provided as a reward.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that so, then what are these infamous three promises? You said, you will give me the world, so in truth I’m quite anxious to figure out what the price is.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“They are simple enough. The first is to never betray me, the second is to never show any hostility towards me and the last is to always in believe in me regardless of my actions.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Such silly conditions in exchange for the entire world? No, I see, you want to conquer the world, but you require a puppet to stand in front of you and attract the attention right?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess was as sharp as ever. It was indeed my intention to use her as a figurehead to control the mortal world. I had already experienced the difficulties and tediousness of personally ruling an empire and was glad to delegate the task to a politically talented mind.</p>
<p>In the next twenty years or so there will be several conflicts against both demons and gods, and it’s necessary to have a figure for the human race to unify them. Regarding this the princess Mayardus would be an excellent candidate.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Something like that, except that I’m not worried about the mortal world. I have a score to settle with a few of those celestial beings living in the sky above us.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are your opponents the High Gods?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back. This was a crucial point because if the princess chose not to oppose those High Gods, we would have no choice but to part ways here and now. It had already been decided that I would face off against them in the very end and this wasn’t likely to change.</p>
<p>Are you aware that I have the blood of High Gods flowing through my veins?”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Truly?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was unable to hide my shock and embarrassment. I had already know that there was a certain connection between the Mirin Kingdom royalty and the High Gods, but never imagined that it was to the extent that they were related by blood.</p>
<p>“You didn’t seem to know. Among royal family we use the God’s stone to communicate with a High God. It does however cost us a certain amount of our life essence</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then I guess you’d refuse my proposal…”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess quickly shook her head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Although I know that we are related by blood, I’ve never felt any sort of kinship with them. Despite all the injustices and depravity occurring in the mortal realm, they have never chosen to intervene. We are like abandoned children in their eyes so I don’t have any special feelings towards them.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m glad to accept your offer, and hopefully one day I can give those High Gods a good slap in the face.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hahaha… thank you princess, but in truth I have much more than just slapping those High Gods in mind.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good then, for now what is the next step? Is it some kind of blood contract?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, for now we do nothing. When the time comes we’ll sign the contract through a third party.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Fine, so what do I do now?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You prepare yourself to rule the world.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“And how do I do that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you know what leveling up is?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve heard of the system. It’s used by adventurers as a way to determine and increase their strength.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Princess, there are three things which are necessary in order to rule the world: outstanding human relations skills, cutting edge technology and great personal strength. Without a combination of these three it would be impossible to dominate over all others for any significant period of time.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That is common sense, is that why you wish to aid me in increasing my level?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back to her.</p>
<p><strong><i>“ I have access to knowledge and technology which surpasses anything available in this world, this can be demonstrated in this one of a kind manor. That’s the first of two advantage you’ll gain from becoming my disciple, the second being the strength of levels which we will gain in this dungeon.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When do we get started?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess seemed eager to start right now, but I needed her to calm down.</p>
<p><strong><i>“After my disciples Jillian and Jerna recover.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, so it was Johra who saved them.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Naturally I couldn’t leave my disciples suffer such a fate.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Because of you I was wrongfully framed.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry about that, but you can think of it as it being because of that misunderstanding that you are now on the path to conquering the entire world.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I let out a light chuckle, it wasn’t my intention but I had caused her quite a bit of trouble.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Was it also you who kidnapped the Marquis?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I indeed had a hand in that.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No way, and how about the recent disappearance of the second Prince in the northern Balkan empire?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, you even know about that?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Are you some kind if kidnapping specialist, Johra?’</p>
<p>Her</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed suspiciously.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Count Sion was one of the few people I could call a friend. It was only normal for my to pay back their transgressions a thousandfold. Not to mention that they even made my two cute disciples suffer.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Her reply was unexpected. At first I expected she would be afraid of the anger I’d shown, but now it was clear that she was likewise seething with hatred.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I held my fair share of grudges with the Marquis, not to mention the second Prince from the Balkan empire.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, but the two kids have the final say in how the revenge is carried out since they lost their father.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I know, it’s just too bad that I won’t have the chance to pay them back for all of their transgressions against me.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You’d be next in line, just not right now.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, the two kids have recently awoken in the medical wing, would you like to speak with them?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena spoke to me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“My two disciples are now awake, would you like to visit them with me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure, I was worried hearing that the two kids were injured so it would be nice to see them.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm, then let’s check up on them.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After a short walk we arrived outside their resting room.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I heard that their eyesight had been compromised. What’s going on Johra? Why is it that these eyes look completely fine?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The eyes on the display screen showed that they were in perfect health.</p>
<p><strong><i>“With the technology of my other world it is possible for such a wound to recover. In the future you will also come to learn these things.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s quite enticing, with such technology anything is within my grasp.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s just the beginning, you have yet to see all that our technology is capable of.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian’s voice came through a speaker, as he had seen us from the room window. Their recovery room was sterilized so we could only speak to them from the outside.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey Jillian, are you doing okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes master. I don’t know if I can see again because of the cloth which is covering my eyes, but at least the pain is gone.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Me too!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna chimed in with a bright smile. The both of them seemed to be doing much better.</p>
<p><strong><i>“The surgery was successful so the two of you should be able to see again in about three days.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really? I thought I’d never be able to see again!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian and Jerna’s happiness exploded out, likewise the princess standing beside me was stupefied.</p>
<p><strong><i>“From now on you can believe in your master.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master!”</i></strong> they replied in unison.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well Lena, they might be bored for the next three days so how about making them study something? They can have auditory lessons.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Study and practice hard you two.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes!…</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes!… Yup!”</i></strong></p>
<p>We then went to meet up with Riley who was our resident torture expert.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I have something to request of you Princess.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What is it, does it have anything to do with this person?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah right, I haven’t introduced you yet. This is Riley, a maid in my manor.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Riley gave a polite bow. Despite having her hands and apron stained with blood, her manners were impeccable.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Where you in the middle of gutting a pig, Riley?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I was taking care of some pig-like humans.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Pig-like humans?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess turned to me questioningly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“We have almost finish interrogating the Marquis and that second Prince, but we would require your assistance to verify certain facts.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m happy to help, where should I go?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Please follow me Princess.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Following behind Riley, the two returned to the torture room with pleased expressions. Riley had asked for some help in verifying certain facts in order to establish a baseline for truths, but perhaps it was simply and excuse to continue torturing them more.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It doesn’t matter though torturing them to the brink of death was Lena’s specialty.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Please believe in me, I’m confident that they won’t die, Hehe.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena knew well the limits of a human body and would be able to push them to the very edge. As a torturer, she was perhaps far more effective and terrifying than the Devil himself.</p>
<p>Going back to my room I took the chance to lie down for some quiet alone time, when I heard the sound of someone sitting on the bed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Who is she? Did you want to have a theesome?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[StudHorse level 5 ➢ 6]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah.. why are you here? And why are you sitting on my bed?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Would you prefer to do it on the floor instead of the bed? It’s a bit hard but it could be interesting.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Pervert level 1 ➢ 2]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn!”</i></strong></p>
<p>From behind Melpomene, Viezda walked in and erupted into a fit of laughter.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No Viezda! It’s not like that!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I told you that I don’t mind if you have another woman, but this is a bit soon.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m innocent here, I was lying down when she walked in and sat on the bed.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t like your cowardly excuses, didn’t we agree to sleep together tonight? Are you planning to have both of us tonight?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda asked as she began undressing.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s not it! Melpomene why are you laughing? This misunderstanding was caused because of you!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can tell by your anxiousness that she is the one you love, but then who is your promised love in the future?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hoho… Johra, was there such a thing as a future love? How come she knows about it despite it being the first I hear of it?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Viezda’s icy laughter made my hair stand up.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Shit! What excuse can I use now?’</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 103</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Time to think hard! I need to find a way to get myself out of this one.’</i></strong></p>
<p>My eyes darted between a disgruntled Viezda and a delighted Melpomene. The pain and mental torture I suffered travelling that desolate land for dozens of years as a skeleton couldn’t compare to the bind I found myself in at this very moment.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I feel like we are already quite close, can I call you sister?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It seems that master loves big sister very much.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Does he truly care for me so?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda was conversing with Melpomene while she shot me a suspicious look.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Since I’ve lost my eyesight, I’ve learned to tell how people feel simply on their intonation. Also It’s very easy to catch someone with perverted thinking.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene turned to me sporting a mischievous smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“My voice? Are you sure you’re not just spouting nonsense?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Most of the time Master’s voice is clear and confident, but occasionally your perverted side seeps in, especially when talking about women. When you talk to me I can sense some expectation from you. Although I’m ready, it’s still a bit soon….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey stop that Melpomene… I’m sure you’re having a ball with shy act, but you’re making it quite difficult for me.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda seemed to be somewhat relieved having heard Melpomene talk. She took her clothes off and whispered to Melpomene.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Our Master is a bit wild in bed time, I can be here for you, to support you in your first time if you’d like.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Damn, what kind of situation has this devolved into? This was never my intention.’</i></strong></p>
<p>I tried to refute Viezda, but she shot me a scary look, instantly silencing me. I simply lied back down in bed and accepted my fate.</p>
<p><strong><i>[StudHorse level 5 ➢ 6]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Sigh…most men would be out of their mind with this blessing, but I just feel weird about it.’</i></strong></p>
<p>Of course it ended up being quite the exciting night, but more than anything it felt like I had become Viezda’s plaything.</p>
<p><strong><i>[StudHorse level 6 ➢ 7]</i></strong></p>
<p>I had already given up caring about these ridiculous titles. Viezda was beautiful and caring as ever. Melpomene however had her shy girl act during the day, but was an unhinged beast in bed.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Pervert level 2 ➢ 3]</i></strong></p>
<p>It seems that just thinking about these things would make these titles level up.</p>
<p>When we woke up the next morning a serious topic suddenly came up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, I have something to tell you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“ What’s up Viezda? You even woke up quite early this time around….”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was still somewhat anxious that she would ask about my future love which she had learned just last night.</p>
<p><strong><i>“In just nine months you’ll become a dad.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Her face shone beautifully in the morning light, no doubt it had all been planned out by Lena. I couldn’t help but let out some emotional tears.</p>
<p>I had been living my entire existence just running from place to place, focusing on my own survival. Even if I was now quite strong,</p>
<p>I had now come across a turning point in my life. It was no longer all about increasing my personal strength, but about creating a better future.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you Viezda!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra! I’m glad you’re happy but I don’t think it’s good for the baby if you hug me so tightly.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… sorry!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Uhh.. congrats sis. I’m a bit sleepy in the mornings so I’ll congratulate you properly later. Congratulations to master as well!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene mumbled a few words of congratulations before drifting back into sleep, but I was still ecstatic.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you know about this Lena? Why didn’t you tell me anything?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry Johra but Viezda insisted that she wanted to tell you herself.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It was my plan, sorry.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all I’m so happy! How can I be a father? There’s now a new purpose to my life!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There are still 9 months left, so you can relax for now.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I kissed her several times, unable to control my happiness.</p>
<p><strong><i>“From now on it will be difficult for us to sleep together, so I’ll let Melpomene take over.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I know that you enjoyed yourself last night Johra, and I won’t take no for an answer. If its sister Melpomene then I’m okay with it, so long as you continue to love me.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course, but Melpomene….”</i></strong></p>
<p>The first time is always the hardest and that already out of the way. Also, I accept her because she understands how much you love me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m sorry.”</i></strong></p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“If you want to be a good father, you need to learn to say I love you more often, instead of I’m sorry.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m a bit hungry, how about getting up and eating breakfast together? Melpomene, will you sleep some more?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Zzzz…Yea.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, let’s go. For now I’d like to keep the news of my pregnancy a secret, because the first few months are the most risky ones. Later I’ll let others know.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I understand.”</i></strong></p>
<p>As we walked down the hallway she leaned on my arm and whispered into my ear.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh and don’t touch the Princess.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“O…of course.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“To gain Johra’s favor she will likely be willing to do anything. If you can’t help yourself I’d understand, but try your best okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I will.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I know what it might be difficult because of your plans for her in the future, else you would not have brought her here. Also, I know that you won’t be keeping her here forever, but if the time does come, please remember my words and be wary of her. She is the kind of woman that knows how to steer a man’s heart.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I’ll keep that in mind.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I won’t ask much from you Johra. When I was at my lowest, you never treated me like the ugly beast which all others saw me as. Even when I was your slave you always treated my as your</p>
<p>She stared at me with her shining bright eyes, but small tears had already begun forming. It was clear that now would not be the best time to let her in on my full life story.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I promise that one day I’ll tell you everything, just not right now. Can you give me a bit more time?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll wait for you for as long as it takes.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thanks”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m also glad that you’re thankful.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt my heart melting while I stared into her eyes and calmly stroked her hair as we walked into the dining hall.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Welcome master,”</i></strong> said the steward.</p>
<p>A breakfast buffet had been prepared and the Princess was already sitting down, sipping her tea. Riley was also accompanying her.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you have fun yesterday?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I indeed had a nice chat with Riley and….”</i></strong></p>
<p>I learned some new torture and interrogation techniques from the Princess. It seems that when humans lose all hope then they easily open up.</p>
<p>Riley seemed to be very pleased about his torture session with the Princess. I couldn’t judge whether the Princess’ torture style was truly revolutionary, or whether it was just that Lena had created Riley’s personality to be so talkative.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So Riley, have we learned anything?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“The story begins with a man named Teiresias. He approached Prince Ardal and convinced him of a certain prophecy, in which he had to conquer Gartmar and the Mirin kingdom in order to save the World.</p>
<p><strong><i>“A prophecy huh…that rings a bell.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He is quite famous. There are a lot rumors regarding him a long lost Messiah or even a Devil.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess chimed in with some extra details.</p>
<p>I recall hearing about him from Nox previously.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Isn’t it a bit strange for the Prince to act solely based on a prophecy?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, at first prince Ardal was tight lipped and proudly exclaimed that he wouldn’t talk. Later when princess Mayardus appeared and revealed his weakness, he eventually broke down and told us that Teiresias had shown him the path to becoming Emperor of the Balkan empire.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, that makes more sense. He was acting in his own self interest right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes and he said it was his plan to absorb the Mirin kingdom in the future.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So despite his dream being to become an Emperor, he focused on embezzling some taxes in a small town like Gartmar?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“But it made quite a lot of sense.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If he hadn’t been so greedy, he might have succeeded.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why? What did he do?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The prophecy from Teiresias was quite specific. He said, to befriend the first adventurer from Gartmar, along with a bunch of other steps. The Prince however ignored the adventurer part, and just used the other knowledge to control the outcome between Sion and Leon. He felt it was the quickest path to conquering the world.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe he thought that nobles would be far more influential than a lone adventurer.”</i></strong></p>
<p>My hairs stood up as I felt</p>
<p>If that had occurred then the future would most likely look very different than it did now. Was that the intention of the prophecy? And what about the future which I’m familiar with? Suddenly I became very interested in meeting this Teiresias fellow.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you find out any information about the one called Teiresias”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We only know that he upped and disappeared about a month ago, leaving a letter behind for the Prince stating how disappointed he was in his performance.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Understandable, I would do the same”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sir Johra, Jillian and Jerna will recover their eyesight later today, would you like us to prepare a sumptuous dinner?”</i></strong> Riley asked.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Great idea, how about putting aside some food for the kids to eat later.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No need to do that, the steward had already only prepared their favorite meals.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I gave the servants a heartwarming smile. They’ve always been taking care of these kids since they were very young.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Steward, there’s something I had been wondering about.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What happened to Levin?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… well he betrayed the Count in order to ensure his survival.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It was order from Sion. He wanted for at least someone to survive in order to exact a revenge. “Was that really Levin? As I remember he was a lazy lad, never someone outstanding.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He has always presente a facade of being a sloth, but in fact he’s always been the most capable servant in the Count’s retinue.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really, then what is he up to now?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe he’s out there planning some sort of revenge.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll have to go fetch him, do you have any idea where he’d be?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He has always been far to talented in hiding, so even if it’s me I wouldn’t know where to start looking.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Very talented in hiding…quite annoying in this case.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“But if he were to know of our rescue, he’d attempt to make contact. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“But how would you keep in touch?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He would leave a certain sign at count Sion’s estate.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, then I should stop by and take a look.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you sir.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all, I feel it’s my duty.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda looked at me with a gentle expression and I smiled back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You have sweet eyes from in the morning.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can’t imagine why that would be. Oh and Princess, you’ll need to join Riley for the study sessions.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Understood sir, I’ll be with Jerna and Jillian. Would you please come with me, princess?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The two went out and I enjoyed a big breakfast alone with Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“ I’ll have to go out today since I have a few things to take care of.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How long should it take Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It might take quite a while, but if it’s too long then I’ll take the time to visit.”</i></strong></p>
<p>When it was about noon, I teleported to the ruins of the Count’s manor.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, can you find anything which might be considered as a sign?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t see anything right now, can you do the turn of the ruins a bit?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I walked around for almost an hour but we couldn’t find anything.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe he isn’t ready to make contact.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll leave behind some reconnaissance nanobots.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good idea, but is it possible for them to stay in contact with our dungeon manor?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Oh, I’ve been experimenting with your teleportation array and have managed to create a similar one, but only for the purposes of transmitting information. It’s how I can always stay in contact.</p>
<p><strong><i>“How convenient, no matter where we are I can always message back home! Does this work anywhere in the world?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think so, it’s some kind of fusion between science and magic, it has always been a dream of mind to combine the two!”</i></strong></p>
<p>After that though I kind of tuned Lena out because she went on to extrapolate her entire theory behind her fusion of science and magic, bringing up boring and tedious concepts.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So is out first objective the Killion dungeon?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, you can get their by boat, leaving from the most southern port of the Mirin Kingdom.</p>
<p>“We aren’t in any big hurry, so we can just take our time. Also, I’d like to make teleportation array midway.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok, I can control the nanobots, but you’ll have to provide the material. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay”</i></strong></p>
<p>It took about a month to arrive to the city-port. I was leisurely experience the life of a human adventurer, using a wagon and stopping and inns, but it wasn’t nearly as fun as I had anticipated.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Phew, although everyone romanticizes about a fantasy world, the truth is that they have primitive technology!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Nonsense! You have magic, different races and a leveling system. It’s like a dream come true!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m not so sure. Anyways now that we’ve arrived at the port, let’s teleport back to our home and visit, it’s been quite a while we’ve been gone.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When you get home you’ll have a surprise waiting for you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What are you talking about?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s a secret.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh, Lena….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You can see yourself!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm okay.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I took some time to stock up on all the specialties they had in town, before exiting the city an heading to a secluded mountain to create the teleportation array.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that you Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda? It’s only been a month, what happened?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“This baby… it seems very eager to be born!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda stomach was huge and it was with great difficulty that she was able to get up and greet me. Melpomene had a big smile as she rubbed the belly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you here Master pervert? At least this kid isn’t a pervert, I can hear that he has a very soft voice.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How can you hear that from inside her stomach?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, it’s true. The baby reacts differently depending on who approaches.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing Lena say that I became thrilled.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘But is it not a normal child?’</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 104</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra!”</i></strong></p>
<p>My two cute disciples leapt into my arms, princess Mayardus followed behind them giving me a smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Both of you have recovered your eyesight, I’m glad.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s all thanks to master.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Actually Johra, it isn’t entirely the same as before.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, what’s the problem?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No problem, in fact it’s the opposite, my eyesight has improved. Also if I can focus very hard I can even see an ants leg despite being 10 meters away.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I had the chance to give them a small upgrade, it’s a good thing no?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena answered by taking command of Riley.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jillian is it something that bothers you in your day to day activities?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well at first I was somewhat surprised, but I’ve already gotten used to it. It still get shocked sometimes when I can see the blood vessels on my arm, but I think I’ll adjust to the changes very soon.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Wow, that sounds like something from a horror movie, can one even get used to that? Seems Lena might have gone a bit far with all these improvements, I might need to have a talk with her later on.’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“By the way Johra, it seems like your son will soon be born.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, I think so too. I often feel the baby kicking. Ooh… seems it was the first time it heard it’s dad’s voice so it was quite energetic.”</i></strong></p>
<p>One could see her belly bulging as the baby moved around. Apparently this signified that a woman was in her later stages of pregnancy.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda it’s a bit hard on you to be walking around, why don’t I accompany you to the bedroom?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Perverted master, do you think I can’t see through your plan? I’ll keep my big sister company.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Pervert level 3 ➢ 4]</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene went up to support Viezda and threw me a look of vigilance. This title was already hopeless, I no longer had any doubt that Melpomene had complete control as to when it leveled up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, ok let’s go together then.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay Johra, but it takes quite long for me to move around, so you can go on ahead first and I’ll catch up with you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No need, I’ll help support you the whole way and Melpomene can help from the other side. Princess, Jerna and Jillian, let’s talk some other time.”</i></strong></p>
<p>It took us about five minutes just to return to her bedroom.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ahhhhhhhhmmmm”</i></strong></p>
<p>As she was getting into bed Viezda spoke out with a frown.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What was that Viezda?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Please leave Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene suddenly kicked my out in a cool tone.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, why? Don’t you think I should be here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Silly, there are certain things a woman isn’t willing to show her man. Just leave please.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What… ah… okay then.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I left the room and paced outside anxiously, but soon after I was allowed back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It had something to do with her menstruation, I’m sorry Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Not at all, I just thought it</p>
<p><strong><i>“Heehee… I’ve heard many stories of how great the master is, but it seems even you are helpless in front of a pregnant woman.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I ignored Melpomene’s teasing and focused solely on caring for Viezda,.</p>
<p>“Johra, You can concentrate on your business, I have Melepomene and Lena if I need any help.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can’t I stay more?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, it’s an order from Viezda, so you need to go.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh..okay.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene had an evil grin on her face as she watched me leave the room. I headed back to the living room on the ground floor to meet up with the two kids and princess Mayardus.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master! You’re back, is everything okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, everything is fine, it’s just that I was kicked out.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I answered with a downtrodden expression.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why does it feel like I’ve already lost to a child which hasn’t even been born yet?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I’ve heard of stories like that, when a child is born then a mothers maternal instincts kick into high gear. The husband is relegated to being the support in the background, but this shouldn’t apply to you. A man like you should be able to do as he pleases.</p>
<p>The princess spoke to me.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Huh did I say something strange? Why is she staring at me like that?’</i></strong></p>
<p>It got a bit awkward but I quickly changed the subject.</p>
<p>“Since you two have recovered your eyesight, I think it’s about time for you both to decide on the punishment for the Marquis and Prince.</p>
<p>“We’ve decided to follow master’s advice. You rescued us from the slave market, a fate which might very well be worse than death.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No this time it is different. In order to move forward you will both need to put this to bed. This is absolutely necessary so that you don’t keep this scar with you throughout your lives. I’m sure it’s what the Count would have wanted, and I do to.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian and Jerna exchanged a look before answering.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then we’d like to enslave the two of them.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Just slaves? They keep their lives?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Death would be too light of a punishment for them. My father suffered terribly as he died, so they can only pay for this crime with an even longer period of suffering.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm I see your point of view, but it would be troublesome is they somehow betray us in the future. We’ll need more than just some regular slavery contract. Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena answered after taking control of Riley.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Could we modify their bodies?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then it’s settled, the Marquis and Prince will be modified into maids of this household. Can we make it so that they will never again be able to refuse and order from either myself or the Sion family?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Sure, I can make it so that they will suffer incredible amounts of pain</p>
<p><strong><i>“Alright”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’d rather have the Devil as an enemy than you Johra,”</i></strong> exclaimed Mayardus as she swallowed nervously. Jerna and Jillian however were delighted by the conclusion.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Good, well now that this has been settled we can move on to my next point….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, we’ve decided to completely dedicate ourselves to you. Everything we are is only because you saved us, we’d do anything you want.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, that’s too much. You are my cute disciples, so I only wish for you two to grow up strong and live great lives.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you master.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian had a determined face but Jerna held a complicated expression.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, will we now start the leveling up which you mentioned to me previously?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Something like that, but first we will have to get you all registered with the adventurers guild and get you set up with a class.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How are we supposed to do that? Won’t there be people who recognize us?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry Jillian, others will never know your real identity. Also we will make a party of 5 members, you three and me plus one more.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Will you truly be joining us? I feel like our difference in strength is far to big.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna asked worriedly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry, I will help you close the gap quite quickly, just believe in me.”</i></strong></p>
<p>All three of them were still quite nervous and it seemed that they would require further explanation.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, could you ask Melpomene to come over, and ask Viezda to lend her the ring I gave her.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes sir!”</i></strong></p>
<p>After Riley left to fetch her, Jillian asked.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Just who is Lena? Whenever master calls she appears, regardless of where we are. Also it seems that Riley, Delaila and Hannah are sometimes Lena.”</i></strong> “She is my magical assistant and the three maids are magical creatures. They have their own personalities, but occasionally Lena can take control because she is a higher ranking existence.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What an amazing story. So many odd occurrences which I couldn’t previously understand now make sense, and it’s quite a bit easier for me to get behind the idea of a magical assistant after the way you were able to help me recover my eyesight. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It would be difficult for me to explain the existence of artificial intelligence, so in order to make them understand I used the magical assistant white lie. Shortly after Riley reappears guiding Melpomene into the living room.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, I’ve borrowed her ring, but she seemed very sad hearing that you were taking it back.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Uh… yeah, I’ll be sure to give Viezda a bigger ring next time. For now I’m loaning it out to you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well I guess it’s your right.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene came and joined us on</p>
<p><strong><i>“So, once Viezda gives birth, the five of us will party together and explore the remaining three major dungeons. Also I’ve thought up a name for our party, Teosponias”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p>All of them were surprised. I understood their reactions seeing as none of them had even fought against a monster before.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, when is Viezda expected to deliver?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Judging by her current growth, it should be within the next five days.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… okay then.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really Johra? How can we go into those four legendary dungeons in just five days? We don’t have any fighting experience….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can’t even see in front of me, what a dark future I must have.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Melpomene… was that a joke?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hohoho~ you can understand my jokes, you do have a sense of humor after all.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I give up.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I threw my hands up in the air in desperation as Melpomene broke out into a huge smile.</p>
<p>In order to put their fear to rest, I began to go into greater detail about my plans. Naturally I only told them about how the ring functioned, but not my innate ability which would allow us to gain monstrous amounts of experience.</p>
<p>The princess eyed me suspiciously, but at the very least she didn’t openly contradict me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So you will help us disguise our appearances in order to register as adventurers and gain a class?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, Lena can help you with that.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Taking over Riley, Lena handed them each a necklace.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When you wear it, it’ll change your appearance into that of someone else.”</i></strong></p>
<p>As the four of them tried it one, they quickly transformed into completely different people due to the power of the holograms. The necklace has been perfected to such a degree that it even changed one’s facial expressions.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is this really happening?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s the first I hear of such a wonderful tool, one can even use it without being skilled in magic. If this technology were to spread in the outside world it is sure to create huge waves.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It would be best if you can help me keep this confidential, is that understood?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I made sure that they ensured its secrecy.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, I still can’t see so I have no idea what has changed,”</i></strong> Melpomene spoke out.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s go and get registered tomorrow, it’s a bit late in the day right now.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m looking forward to it.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Me too!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can safely travel in the outside world with this tool and won’t have to stay cooped up in this mansion my whole life. Thank you so much Johra!”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Princess thanked me earnestly, but Melpomene protested immediately.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’d prefer to stay beside Viezda. It’s too bad that I don’t have a choice in the matter since I need to follow your commands.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey Melpomene, if you keep complaining so much I’ll tell Viezda.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, okay… show some mercy to the blind would you.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Geez, you really know how to milk that handicap</p>
<p>Boo hoo~</p>
<p>Melpomene stuck out her tongue childishly, before grabbing hold of Riley’s hand.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Please take me back to see big sis Viezda, I need to let her know that Johra is bullying me.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What, when did I do that Melpomene?”</i></strong></p>
<p>However the two of them disappeared without any response.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Have you found some way to help Melpomene recover her eyesight?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena was quick to answer.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve done a thorough investigation and it was just as I had suspected. She has suffered from this condition for so long that a simple transplant wouldn’t work. Not to mention that as a High Elf her brain is different from that of a humans, so I wouldn’t even know where to begin.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see.”</i></strong></p>
<p>In truth Melpomene had yet to come clean to everyone with the fact that she was a High Elf. I would have to look more into it later on, but at least for now there didn’t seem to be any easy solution to help her recover her eyesight.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, help instruct Jillian, Jerna and the Princess about being an adventurer, the different classes as well as any information regarding the four dungeons.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok, I’ll see to it.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Leaving the three behind I went to Viezda’s bedroom.</p>
<p>Walking inside, I came upon the scene of Viezda rubbing her belly, while Melpomene put her ear to it, listening for any sounds. She was also singing a in a delightful cheery voice. It was the most beautiful song I had ever heard in my entire life. Her song depicted a story of the gods and love among humans, promising a bright and new tomorrow.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huhhh?”</i></strong></p>
<p>when Viezda called me out Melpomene abruptly cut short her song.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why did you stop singing? It was wonderful.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmph, this kind of song isn’t for you to hear”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, why is it that I can’t listen?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt a bit hurt that I wouldn’t be able to hear that beautiful voice once more.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s not that….”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda spoke to me as she cradled a shy Melpomene.</p>
<p><strong><i>“She’s just too embarrassed right now. She likes Johra, but..she is too shy to admit it. If you two would just go ahead and do that….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Big Sis!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene turned red like a tomato.</p>
<p><strong><i>“If you think of me as a sister then at least heed my advice. Speak truly, what do you think of Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Tch! Johra’s nothing but a pervert.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“But didn’t you tell me previously that you liked him?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sister is so mean!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well if that’s what it takes to get you to listen then it’s fine.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah I can’t stay angry with you….”</i></strong></p>
<p>The two women were embracing each other and I felt completely out of place.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It seems like I’ve completely lost my Viezda to this Melpomene….”</i></strong></p>
<p>Sighing to myself I retreated from the room and headed to my underground lab to study up the summarized version of the dungeons which Lena had prepared.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 105</p>
<p><strong><i>“What? Just when did I fall asleep? Oh, and why are Viezda and Melpomene here as well?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had fallen asleep in my underground lab and somehow these two women had joined me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess I would have been cold just falling asleep like that… did they come join me because they were lonely?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You were all sleeping for quite some time, so I had Riley bring in a large armchair which you would all fit in,”</i></strong> Lena explained. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Were they worried because they understood that I was a bit sad after feeling been ignored?’</i></strong></p>
<p>Picking up Viezda I brought her to her room and laid her down on the bed. I then returned to the lab to pick up Melpomene as well.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra~ bring me to a different room. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene who had just woken up gave me a deep kiss.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… about that…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry about it, I’ve already discussed it with Viezda. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I then fell asleep for a second time, however not before indulging myself in some alone time with Melpomene first. When I woke up in the middle of night, Viezda was asleep on my chest, while Melpomene was behind her. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Isn’t it only awkward for me? ’</i></strong></p>
<p>They both had happy expressions which helped relieve my anxiety.</p>
<p>The next morning I gathered the members of our Teos party and we prepared ourselves to visit Gartmar.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, be sure to notify immediately if there are any signs of her giving birth. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry, I’ll let you know immediately. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Go without any worries, Johra. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After speaking with Lena and Viezda, I turned to my party members.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Shall we go?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene was beside me holding my hand, while Jerna, Jillian and Mayardus stood around us. With all of us ready, I activated the teleportation magic.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, where is this, master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We’re in the forest, not too far from Gartmar. It’s only about a twelve minute walk to the city. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah that’s a city I never expected to see again. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well I can’t see anything, so I guess I’ll have to be satisfied with only the smell and sounds, Huuu~”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene moment of self reflection increased my desire to cure her eyesight, but I simply didn’t know how. Although I did have a certain idea in mind, it wasn’t clear whether it would work so I could only put it to the side for the moment.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Where do you all come from, it’s my first time seeing you in these parts. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We’ve come from very far away only to become adventurers. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Is that so, how uncommon. Gartmar’s Adventurer’s Guild is quite new</p>
<p>The old guard let us through without much questioning. No doubt he was quite sympathetic since our party also included a blind girl.</p>
<p>I was already very familiar with the layout of Gartmar, so we took the shortest route to the guild. Despite it being quite some time since my last visit, not much had changed since it was still quite the desolate place and the manager Chu was half asleep at her reception desk.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, welcome! Oh, is this our first time meeting?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, we’d like to register as adventurers. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure, please pay the registration fee, also I don’t believe that we have enough beginner sets for everyone. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, just give us the ones you have and we’ll split it among us, Is this the registration form?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes~ Yes~”</i></strong></p>
<p>We simply made up our own names and the application procedure went by smoothly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huaa~ I was shaking in there!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Me too! I was worried that someone would recognize us. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If that were to be the case, we would have been stopped as we were entering the city. Still, now that we are officially adventurers it’s like having a new identity and fulfilling dreams that we couldn’t have in our previous lives, thank you so much Johra!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Princess Mayardus spoke over the two kids and thanked me earnestly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“We’re not quite yet finished. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, where are we going to next?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene asked curiously as we held hands.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s now time to receive our classes. We’ll visit some old friends whom I know well, of course they won’t recognize my current self. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The first one we went to visit was Ryan, who was in charge of the Warrior’s Guild.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, it’s been quite some time since we’ve had any guests. Are you all seeking to improve your power as adventurers?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, please help us out with that. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Quickly taking care of that we then headed to the Wizard’s Guild.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are all five of you here to get a new class? But it seems you all already have a class, is that okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We would be in your debt. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The cute Fero who was the one in charge of the guild was kind enough to give us all the class.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you so much Fero!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I even went out of my way to buy a ton of HP and MP potions in order to show our appreciation.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can you carry that much?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not to worry, just this much…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I then divided up the items amongst us and stepped outside the guild.</p>
<p>“Are we</p>
<p><strong><i>“Not quite yet, there still remains one. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>We then headed towards the temple and I handed over a silver coin to the friar standing by the entrance.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Would you be so kind as to guide us to meet priest Rohan?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Follow me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>We then waited for a short time in the reception hall.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Somehow I end up meeting Rohan quite often. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>While i was mumbling to myself, a younger version of priest Rohan showed up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is this some kind of special day? Why are so many youngsters looking for me all of a sudden?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you priest Rohan?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We’d like to register our class as priests please, we’re adventurers. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Priests…? But all of you already have different classes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How extraordinary, some time ago there was a young lad who also had several classes and wished to become a paladin… what was his name again? Ah yes, Johra. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Our party members looked at me suspiciously but I kept up an innocent facade.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What kind of person was he, I wonder if we’d meet one day. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He was a unique fellow, with clear eyes and many stories. It was fated by god that I’d meet him, but I haven’t seen him since. Still, I believe that we’ll meet again some day. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘I’m right here. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>I wanted to answer that I was glad to see him again, but I couldn’t blow our cover.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then would it be fine to register the four of us?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess I can go through with just a simple ordination? I was recently summoned by the main Catholic Church so I’ll be leaving shortly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s what we want”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, okay follow me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Rohan brought us to the chapel and after giving a long winded speech ordained the other four members of our party, choosing to exclude me. It was only later that I learned that only a select few High Priests were capable of conferring priesthood onto others. It was his destiny to return to the Archdiocese after our meeting. In fact he was already a very high position member of the Church, but it was only due to his lack of ambition that he chose to remain in such a rural area.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t know when we will next meet, but I hope that you all try your best to keep this city and its people safe. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Won’t you come back here again?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think this task will end any time soon. There is a rumor that the recent issues are connected to the Devil. It has something to do with all the recent kidnappings</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Ah was it because of my actions that Rohan is being called away for duty? How unfortunate. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If you let me know where you are headed [perhaps we can see eachother again in the near future. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I asked question Rohan for some details about his travels. It was my hope to meet again so that I could influence his future for the better, after all having I was the one who affected it in the first place.</p>
<p>After leaving the temple I then brought them to a weapons store.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s see… for Jillian a sword and shield. For Jerna a staff would do well, for Melpomene uhh…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Will I also fight?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Absolutely not. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it because I can’t see what’s in front of me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t worry about it, we’ll figure something out. For now we’ll get you a shield. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Your not planning on sending me out to the front line are you?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene made a ridiculous face.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course not, don’t worry about it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The last stop was to outfit everyone with some armor. I purchased a set of leather armor for everyone and then we headed back into the forest which I can hunted in so many times with Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Look, it’s a horned rabbit!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s so cute! But it looks a bit savage. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It took some getting used to but they were soon able to effectively hunt the rabbits with their swords and magic spells, resulting in decent experience.</p>
<p>Scouring the outer edge of the forest, we were able to catch a total of ten horned rabbits, which allowed us to improve our teamwork and fit into our roles. However Melpomene soon after began to complain.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why am I even here? I’m just a hindrance and you have to always lead my around by the hand. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I tried to lift her spirits with some encouraging words.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t yet know of a cure for your condition but I believe that if we keep looking we are sure to find one!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Didn’t I ever tell you Johra? The loss of my eyesight isn’t the result of an injury. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, were you born that way then?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I was cursed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“A curse?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… I’ll just explain it to you tonight, I don’t really want to talk about it right now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After nodding back solemnly to Melpomene, I called Jillian over.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jillian!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you now familiar with the basic skills and role of a warrior?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian who had previously received some lessons due to his status as the Count’s heir, was already proficient with the sword and shield. Likewise he was improving in</p>
<p><strong><i>“Please leave it to me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“From now on we will be hunting more dangerous prey, so everyone make sure to be careful. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Up to now our hunting had been going very smoothly, but it seemed that my warning had gone a bit past the desired effect as it frightened them too much.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, it’ll be a bit dangerous but not too much. Just be sure to watch your surroundings and protect Melpomene, also don’t forget to wear your rings. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Leaving them behind I headed deeper into the forest. My reasons for choosing this place were twofold, first was to gain some experience hinting as a party and the second was to power level then by using the goblins.</p>
<p>Actually, I had one more reason to come here, which was Lilinor. I had yet to hear back from her and despite having travelled deep in the forest I couldn’t find any signs of her presence.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Where could she have gone?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was luring all the goblins I could find in the forest until I had almost a hundred of them following me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, behind you!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There’s a bunch of them coming this way!”</i></strong></p>
<p>When I was still about twenty meters away form the group, I turned around to face the goblins.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Help me out Lena. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay I’ve mapped them all out and predicted their trajectories. Those marked red are closer and therefore those you should prioritize. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Perfect, thanks. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Shuu Shuu!</p>
<p>I began trapping them with my Web Shots, but it took almost 30 minutes to capture them all. It was laughable that they would ignore their trapped comrade’s pleas and simply charge head first, resulting in a giant mountain of more than one hundred goblin bodies.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is everyone wearing their ring?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then let’s get started! Lena, Rohim’s Shield!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Once the shield was up I began casting my skill.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Create Material: Positron!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Kuuuuuuung</p>
<p>I created a decent sized one and threw it to the center of the goblin mountain, resulting in a huge explosion.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Was that too much overkill?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[+5 experience points]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[+10 experience points]</i></strong></p>
<p>…</p>
<p><strong><i>[+5* 2^117 experience points]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Level increased ➢ 932]</i></strong></p>
<p>Following the mushroom cloud which shot up into the air, a wealth of experience points began pouring in. Fortunately we were protected by the shield and didn’t suffer any damage.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Still not max level? At least it’s still a crazy amount of experience. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, just what is going on?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Everyone in the party was freaking out about the insane amount of level ups</p>
<p><strong><i>“This is the reason we are here, how is everyone looking?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I opened up their statuses to take a look.</p>

He should still however learn the occasional magic spell to give him more of a complete build. His evolution choices seem to be the same ones which I was presented with last time around, but what kind of title is that Blessing of Death? It’s so strange, I don’t feel like it had anything to do with me right?’</i></strong></p>

<p>After having lived in this world for quite some time I’ve realized that it’s not just anyone that could view statuses, even their own. I was barely able to keep my composure, realizing that I she was a rare jewel which I had gained.</p>

<p>‘Huh, so she</p>
<p>While I was deep in thought observing the statuses of my party members, Jillian, Jerna and Mayardus had stopped talking and only stared back. They were not doubt curious as to why I had fallen silent for so long, but for now I was like a child opening his gifts on Christmas morning, my vision narrowed down to these new prizes of mine and nothing else existed at the moment.</p>
<p>Melpomene on the other hand stood behind me and sang in a light hum. Although I couldn’t catch any of the words she was using, it felt like joyful song which uplifted all our hearts. Perhaps it was a Soothing song.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So by now you must have all realized that you’ve undergone some big changes right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, although it’s a bit tiring, the world appears so different compared to before. I can see so much more. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Same here brother, it might have something to do with our enhanced eyesight, everything looks brighter. I also feel that my intelligence has improved, and I can understand much clearer the knowledge lessons which Lena had previously imparted to us. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed everyone seems to have changed a bit. For my part I have gained much confidence in myself, was it thanks to this ring?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Princess Mayardus’ mindset was no doubt connected to her Throne’s Blessing.</p>
<p>Melpomene who had been pulling on my sleeve as she always had, didn’t realize her newfound strength and caused it to rip. Unfazed, she continued to sing her light hum, conveying to me her heartfelt feelings.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Once you’ve reached your max level, as humans you are able to go on to a next step. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really? Then…. ?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra I heard that unlike other races, there aren’t any cases of that happening because it’s much more difficult for humans to hit their max level within our short lifespans. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess asked me with a dubious expression. Jerna and Jillian however sported a look of incredulity.</p>
<p>“Normally that would definitely be the case, but it’s all possible due to this ring which I received from clearing the Jeduth</p>
<p><strong><i>“Such a legendary artifact has never been recorded in all of history. I have heard of a similar looking ring which can share experience between party members, but never one that can increase the experience received to such an extent. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Ah… so the princess has heard of the party ring. Of course I can’t tell her the truth though. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“This is on a completely different level compared to those party rings, so it’d be best if you don’t mention the existence of these rings to others, okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I made up this white lie in order to hide that fact that the origin of such ridiculous amounts of experience was in fact me. On one hand I wanted to protect my secrets, but i also didn’t want to crumble the legendary image which my cute disciples held of me, by letting them know how easily I had achieved my strength with such a cheat ability.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So what you are saying Johra is that humans can also evolve?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I wondered how the princess had such precise knowledge about evolution. No doubt it was the royal family which had access to some secretive information which wasn’t made available to the public.</p>
<p><strong><i>“There’s a legend that the first king of our royal lineage had evolved into a Higher Human, a race with incredible Intelligence that surpassed anything a regular human might achieve. It was said that he had achieved an existence which brought one close to a god. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hmm, so High Humans are something like God’s sidekicks?’</i></strong></p>
<p>In fact I was originally planning on using them to explore all three human evolution paths, but now that Mayardus had the ability to Evolve into Nosferatu, even more options were available.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘It would be a bit difficult to convince a princess to turn into a vampire though, how can I go about this?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve heard about High Humans, but I had no idea that it was the founding king who was the first to become so, it must have been some classified information. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna replied while looking at Mayardus curiously.</p>
<p><strong><i>“More importantly, do you have the ability to check our Statuses? I saw you staring at us previously. According to the records of our Royal family, only existences on like supreme sages had that kind of ability. Can it be that you can also do it?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It seemed that this princess had access to far more sensitive information than I imagined. I would have to keep a closer eye on her</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I have the ability to view Statuses. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really? Is it possible for me to evolve, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, you can indeed Evolve. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I explained to Jillian Jerna and Mayardus what their current stats and evolution paths were.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ahem… so Jillian can evolve into a Meta Human, Jerna a Higher Human and for the Princess it’s a Nosferatu. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing my explanation the Princes’ expression turned cold.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Mayardus, are you aware that a Nosferatu is much like a vampire?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course I know this much. They are very powerful and also have a much stronger vitality than humans. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes… but you’d essentially become a vampire. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“As someone who wishes to rule above all others, this is a necessary sacrifice I suppose. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>She seemed determined, and I felt a bit bad that I was manipulating her into this to satisfy my own curiosity.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it because vampires have specific weaknesses. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, when it lacks blood then they fall asleep into a deep slumber and in the sunlight they become like any regular human. Also they are very weak to any weapons crafted out of silver. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although it was different form the stories which I had heard about vampires, the princess seemed to be have all the facts and be making an informed decision, so I had no reason to oppose it.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I still think it might be a good idea to collect as much information about the Nosferatu as you can before picking it as an evolution. Is there any place you can think of where we can find such information?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It can only be in our royal family’s private library. If it’s you Johra, I’m sure you can easily break in there. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back and asked her for any details she which my help me get in.</p>
<p>I then teleported is back to the dungeon manor and planned my break in into the royal library. Viezda was lying down in bed all day because she was too heavy to walk around, so Lena didn’t let her come to greet us. We then had a sumptuous dinner together and left the three behind to continue to receive further instruction under Lena. Without anyone knowing, I escorted Melpomene down to the lab, just the two of us.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can you tell me know what you know about your curse?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you for your concern, but before that…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes? What is it?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Why do</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why do you take such good care of me in spite of your doubts towards me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So you knew. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course, I may not be able to see, but it makes me very sensitive to others’ feelings. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then why are you also hiding that you’re a High Elf? Is it also related to your curse?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, were you referring to my race?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s a curse I’ve received form the gods. In order for my twin brother to receive the power of foresight, a certain price needed to be paid. My eyesight was robbed from me for that reason. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The power to see in the future? What is your brother’s name?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He is Teireisias. He’s known as the cursed prophet. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was a name which I had heard several times already, form both Nox and Ardal.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So you were cursed in order for him to gain his power?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“High Elves are the race which are the most compatible with the power of the gods. Even then, there is still a certain price to pay to acquire such a power. This is an immutable truth, so because were twins and linked by fate, I suffered his punishment as a result. After my brother learned of this, he stopped creating prophecies for the Gods and we were cursed instead. That’s why he is now known as the Cursed Prophet. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, so what kind of curse did you receive. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“My curse is eternal suffering, losing my eyesight is also a result of it. The ultimately my Karma will continue to deteriorate over time which would increase my torture. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What a horrible fate. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“My brother once prophesied for me that my savior would be the enemy of the High Gods. That he would be one who breathes, yet doesn’t live. I never expected that it would be you, Johra. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You aren’t human right, Johra? In fact you aren’t even alive are you? My brother’s prophecies have never been wrong. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was left stunned and speechless. I had never imagine that she had seen through my identity to such an extent.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It doesn’t matter, you are my predestined savior, and I’ll follow you even if you are the Devil himself. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene demonstrated her utmost devotion as she prostrated herself on the floor before me.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hmm… this might end up be a good thing instead. This brother of hers, Teireisias….. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 107</p>
<p><strong><i>“Get up Melpomene, it’s a bit awkward if you stay prostrated like that. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I won’t move until master accepts me. ”</i></strong>-1</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you testing my patience?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I know too many of your secrets, and knowing your temperament it is likely that unless you accept me you’d kill me off. I can only wait like this, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you doing all this because of the prophecy which your brother foretold?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe at first, but now it is entirely out of my own free will. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm, but how can I tell whether you’re moving according to the prophecy or your own free will?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How can I prove it to you? I simply know that I’m acting on my own free will. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Who’s to say that your so called free will hasn’t already been determined by the prophecy?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m certain I would have acted the same even without having any knowledge of the prophecy. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why would that be? I am simply your owner. If we didn’t have this slavery contract binding us, wouldn’t we just be strangers?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We’ve already slept together. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If that’s something you regret then Viezda can help you forget it altogether. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“When you chose me I already became yours. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s only because on the slave contract. If it were another master it would be the same ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I am blind. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m already aware of that, are you seeking sympathy here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>““No, just that when choosing a slave, it’s normal to pick one which has a useful ability. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“As you said, I am a pervert. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hm, were you insulted by those remarks?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’d be lying if I said no. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Fine then, I was mostly curious as to why your voice would appear to shine so brightly when you were talking to me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Shine?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Although I can’t see, when you talk to me I can feel your voice is more brilliant than any others. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Didn’t you say I sounded perverted?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That was just a lie I used to hide my true feelings. Ever since hearing master voice I had already decided to follow you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What is that supposed to mean?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I just wanted to know what kind of a person could have such a unique voice. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe it’s just the way I sound. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t have anything to do with the tone or pitch, but some kind of</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can it be that it’s because of the prophecy you’ve heard from your brother?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, instead my impression of my brother prophecy was one of disgust. I was fated to be with a repulsive and evil undead creature with the fate of the world hanging in the balance. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why does that sound like some kind of demon?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Right, knowing that much I had already given up on my future, but ever since I’ve met master, my opinion has completely changed. The way you spoke to big sis and I, it was the most beautiful voice I’d ever heard.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t talk like that, it’s too much. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s just say that ever since I’ve been cursed, I’ve always regretted having lost my ability to see. It was only when I met you and heard your unique voice that for the first time I felt blessed to be blind. I don’t care if I die now, I just seek your acceptance. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I looked down at her once more. She knew far too many of my secrets and was possibly being influenced by some unknown prophecy. By not accepting her would I be undoing that prophecy? Just what were the exact contents of that prophecy in the first place?</p>
<p>This prophecy which had been made by Teireisias was too much of an unknown factor. Nox was sealed and Prince Ardal was imprisoned in my very own manor.</p>
<p>Can we alter a prophecy? By knowing the future shouldn’t it be possible to change it? How can an unchangeable future even exist?</p>
<p>An endless questions of existentialism swirled within me.</p>
<p>Closing my eyes, I asked myself.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘I don’t know which choice is the right one. It seems like regardless which one I choose I’ll be fettered to a predestined prophecy. And what if I decide not to choose at all, how would that affect the future?’</i></strong></p>
<p>Opening my eyes, I look back down to Melpomene and speak out.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I can’t accept you for now. Instead you will continue to serve by my side where I’ll be keeping a close eye on you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, so in the end it went through as expected. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Inside of me I cried out in frustration. Was it already predestined that I would put off this</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, get up now Melpomene. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ye…. s, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Grabbing her heart in pain, she shot up to her feet. It was because as her owner, I had used her name to issue a command.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t yet know you well enough, and because you’ve hidden your brother’s prophecy from me I can’t trust you. If it were entirely up to me you wouldn’t live to see another day, but since you are so close with Viezda, I wouldn’t want to see her get hurt. In the future you can’t reveal any of my secrets and you can’t keep anything from me. Is that understood, Melpomene?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I promise. Don’t worry, I won’t betray you even if it costs me my life. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Giving me a sincere look, she gently grabbed my hand.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, you may have deceived me once, but there won’t be a second time or I assure you that I’ll kill you myself. I been betrayed in the past and decided not to forgive anyone again. Maybe I’ll regret making an exception and giving you a second chance, but I just can’t bear to break Viezda’s heart right now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I would likewise never want to make big sister sad. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Any living being is capable of betraying others for their own benefit. The only solution to that is to end their lives. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll be different. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Stop pretending to be so all knowing already. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene cried out in surprise as I picked her up in a princess carry. She hadn’t expected for me to do that.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Don’t misunderstand, there no hidden meaning. You are simply my slave so I want to look after my property. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes… Yes…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>As I carried her back to the bedroom she lead her blushing face against my chest.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you want to do it with me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I have work to do. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you preparing for the future, master?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Looking down at her with a frown, I ask <strong><i>“ just how much do you know. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think I might know more about your future than even you do, master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, well I’ll hear all about it some other day, I’m busy now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, I’ll</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I’ll be waiting. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I left the room without saying another word.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘How troublesome, both Melpomene and her brother know far more than they should about me. If that kind of information ever arrived in the hands of the High Gods, it could be used against me. For the moment I can’t let her out of this dungeon. What about Teireisias though? No, I don’t have time to worry about him right now. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>I teleported out and arrived in the most southern port city of the Mirin Kingdom and boarded the boat for which I had previously purchased a ticket.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Geez… things have gotten even more complicated. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Staring out at the calm ocean, I tried to organize my thoughts, but peace did not arrive so easily.</p>
<p>Three days later the boat docked at our destination which was an island.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This is Atol Island, home to the famous Killion Dungeon,”</i></strong> exclaimed the ship master as we prepared to disembark. Looking ahead of me I realized that it was a bigger island than I had expected. After all, it was said that it had a diameter of 60 kilometers.</p>
<p>Leaving the harbor behind, I first headed to the outskirts of town and set up a teleportation array in a secluded area. I then headed to the village closest to the Killion dungeon. The dungeon itself was at the very center of the island, under a large volcano. Nearby, a small village had formed to serve the needs of countless adventurers. It had eventually developed into a decently sized city with a population of 20,000 people.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why is it so hot?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although in general it was true that the southern provinces were hotter, the heat generated by the volcano made the ambient temperature borderline unbearable, like that of a desert in midsummer.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, the Killion dungeon is huge beyond imagination. To date, 20 entire floors have been discovered, each housing a wide variety of artifacts, flora, fauna and minerals. The resources harvested by the adventurers help fuel the industry that not only this city, but the entire island depend on. Also…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena continued with her detailed description.</p>
<p>“ I’m aware, thanks. I won’t be the only one in there, got it.</p>
<p>I stopped by the Adventurer’s guild and took a look at their quests, before then doing the turn of the shops in town.</p>
<p><strong><i>“A finally found it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Where you looking for a map, Johra?”</i></strong> I would easily map out the place once you’ve walked in. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I still need their crude maps, because if I want to go where none have gone before, it’s necessary to know what areas they have already visited. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, you didn’t actually need the map, just wanted to know how much has already been explored. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After my short conversation with Lena, I walked into the dungeon. The first floor was named Cold Sand and although it was scorching hot outside, in here there was an endless desert filled with sand which was cold to the touch. Also, it appeared to be night time instead. It had definitely been around noon when I set foot inside the dungeon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It seems that just like the last dungeon, this one is also exists within a separate dimension. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think so too, all my sensors are being affected, as if by some terrestrial magnetism. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was the same for my Spider Senses. Everything seemed off, like the nauseating feeling of being spun around and around in a whirlpool.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll be counting on you, Lena. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Understood, I’ll start mapping out this floor. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>10 minutes later we had a better understanding of our surroundings.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Going straight seems to be the best path here. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The exit is in the opposite direction of the Moon. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Does the moon not move in here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t know, but I guess that if it did, the exit would change accordingly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I spoke with Lena as we crossed the Pingdao Temple desert. I was occasionally attacked by some silver colored scorpions, but made quick work of them. It was quite boring so I kept conversing with Lena.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, you need to immediately head back to your dungeon manor. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Creating a thin sheet of platinum on the ground I drew a teleportation array.</p>
<p>Shuung!</p>
<p>The landscape changed before my eyes, and I noticed my servants waiting for me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, it’s great that you’ve come, follow me!”</i></strong></p>
<p>The steward dragged me off without explaining further.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 108</p>
<p>I heard some crying coming from the medical wing as the steward urged me on.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Already?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It was just born, come on!”</i></strong></p>
<p>As I stepped into the room, I first noticed my cute baby girl in the android Hanna’s arms. Viezda was laying down, terribly exhausted, but the one thing that jumped out at me was that our baby’s skin a was a light blue for some reason. (Delaila/ Humanoid Android, Hanna/Cat Ear Android, Riley/ Dog Ear Android)</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you give birth? Is that our child Viezda?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Looking up at me she nodded.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Please step outside since there’s a risk of infection. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Delaila drove me away and I was resigned to looking in through the window. Standing there in a moment of bliss.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did I just become a father?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The steward replied and give me a an encouraging pat on the back</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why is such a great thing happening to me? I don’t deserve it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Those kind of weak words are an insult to all fathers out there. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Steward answered strictly.</p>
<p>My mentality was still that of a high schooler. Although I had only spent roughly 6 months in this world, I had spent several years here last time around, not to mention my trip back to earth. My life’s clock which had been put on pause on that fateful day when I had tumbled down the manhole, had finally begun ticking again.</p>
<p>No, I forced it to start ticking in order to be a proper father to this child of mine.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, this might just be a saying, but I’ve heard that a mother falls into her role naturally, while being a father requires determination. If you are feeling anxious right now then it’s in fact a good sign. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you steward, your words are quite comforting. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You are most welcome, although I’m sure you’d do just fine without my advice. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>All my worries in the world vanished as I stared at this child of mine cradled in Viezda’s arms. Whether it was time which had stopped or some other mystical effect, I couldn’t care less and simply kept staring.</p>
<p>Just for the sake of this child, I knew I was willing to forgive anything, and at the same time kill anyone in the world.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Just after the steward left to put the finishing touches on our baby’s new room, Melpomene snuck up from behind and wrapped her arms around me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hi Melpomene. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is the baby pretty?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How beautiful?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Enough to forgive the world. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, then am I forgiven?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, that’s still up in the air. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Did I truly commit a sin greater than the world itself?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“…”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I want to have a child as well. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We can’t”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why not?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I need to make sure there is nothing that can harm this baby girl of mine. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Why would it harm</p>
<p><strong><i>“Possibly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you mean it’s still a possibility?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not for now, there are things I need to do. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing some voices coming this way, I removed Melpomene’s arms from around my waist. She pursed her lips in complaint, but she understood that it was because of the incoming footsteps, so she just focused on the sounds coming from the medical room.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, sorry we’re so late!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian, Jerna and the Princess rushed down the corridor. Apparently they had just returned from some battle.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, I also just arrived. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What about the baby, is it born yet?”</i></strong></p>
<p>At that moment they all curiously looked through the window, drawn in by the sight of my baby girl.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that a mysterious creature?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Mayardus exclaimed in surprised. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m not color blind am I? She really is blue, right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Umm… I think so. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master have you named her yet?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I had previously decided with Viezda that if we had a daughter, we’d name her Veznos”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Veznos? What does it mean?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna asked curiously as she swished her blond her and rearranged it behind her ear with a bright expression.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It signifies forever. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Forever? Like in immortal?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jilion asked.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Actually, it means to not disappear, to be everlasting. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Vez-nos… it’s a good, mysterious name. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Princess nodded, repeating the name to herself in a whisper.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda thought so too. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m quite happy that you all like her name, it must be an auspicious sign. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Come this way, it’s time for her to meet her father so let’s get you sterilized. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ridley came out and led me into the adjacent room to get me disinfected. She had a creepy smile and I felt like a prisoner walking into a gas chamber in the Auschwitz concentration camp.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Is she trying to kill me off like this? No, I can’t die before even holding my baby girl…. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>The gases dissipated, putting an end to my delusions as she handed me a hospital gown.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Come this way. Also, do you even know the proper way of holding a baby? You need to have one hand support her neck while the other cradles her from behind. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>More or less ignoring Riley explanation, I ran over to Viezda as soon as I entered the room.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Viezda! Our baby girl!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Johra. She just fell asleep after feeding, she must have been very tired. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Veznos was sleeping so peacefully, without a care in the world. I approached her with my finger, curious what it would feel like to touch her but Viezda glared at me dangerously, so I backed off and gave Viezda a kiss on her forehead. It seems one should not make a mother feel jealous.</p>
<p>Although I could see the others waving excitedly form across the window, I was tuning</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra why don’t why just call her Vez for now, she’s still young and a shorter name would be easier. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure that sounds good. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s our baby but why is she blue skinned?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘I’m not sure, but I think it might have something to do with her abilities, I’ll explain them to you later okay?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Some mysterious blue light?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s not the specific answer?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Haha, don’t worry, it’s a good thing. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Mom? Dad?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It had now been a week since little Vez had been born, but due to her abilities like <strong><i>[Rapid Growth]</i></strong> and <strong><i>[Quick Learner Lv7]</i></strong>, she was unlike other newborns.</p>
<p>The first time a child calls it’s parents is a very special moment, but I still couldn’t truly believe that I had become a father.</p>
<p>I was having fun teaching our baby girl new things, and the fact that she learned super fast made it all the more enjoyable.</p>
<p>I focused on spending a lot of time with Vez, which gave Viezda the time she needed to recover from the pregnancy.</p>
<p>During the next three months Vez showed extraordinary growth. She stayed with me most of the time as Viezda took the time to explore the dungeon in hopes of rehabilitating her body.</p>
<p>Vez was able to walk and talk as well as any adult, and had the knowledge of an average fifth grader. The blueish light she emitted had for the most for disappeared. She gained a better grasp on how to control it, leaving behind just a small tint and almost looked like a normal child.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dad, please teach me about magic today. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>She put on her cutest face and grasped her hands together as she pleaded. She knew that it was too easy to manipulate me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“If it’s about magic, although I use it, I don’t know much about it. Lena is far more knowledgeable about it than me so how about asking her?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah but I want to hear it with Daddy. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok, how about we go meet Lena together?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yup! Then will she come in Riley’s body today?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Up to you Vez, do you prefer the Cat sister or Dog sister?”</i></strong></p>
<p>She had a cute expression as she seemed to seriously ponder over the question.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmmm… Yesterday was the Cat sister and the day before was the Dog sister, so today it’ll be the regular sister!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you get that Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yep. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Delaila was quickly sent over and began explaining the theory behind magic.</p>
<p><strong><i>“In fact, magic, in its fundamental form is just another kind of science. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, Are you sure?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I cried out in surprise but Delaila quickly shushed me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master please allow me to finish. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you sure what you are claiming is true?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed it is, allow me to prove it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Proof?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, in fact it was through observing your use of magic</p>
<p><strong><i>“Truly?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, although I’m not 100% certain as of yet, there are several examples of simple magic which can be explained through science.</p>
<p>I was baffled by her recent findings.</p>
<p>I’ve analyzed thousands on books in this world, and it was clear that their understanding of science was very primitive, so this theory of mine indeed sounds a bit weak. Allow me to explain how I came to such a conclusion. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh right, Vez you wanted to learn magic form this right? Is this okay?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, it sounds to be quite interesting so please continue sister Delaila. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Vez is a model student, unlike some other pretentious student which I know. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Tch!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Despite feeling wronged, I was more curious about her subsequent explanation so I quickly focused.</p>
<p>“There are still a few phenomenon which science can’t yet account for such as certain Myths; Positrons, where by trying to experiment on them causes the results to change, and Entanglement, which is the theory which all things are connected, regardless of distance. There are still a lot of mysterious things which exists outside the boundaries of science, such as the pocket dimension in the dungeons we’ve visited.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Quantum theory? I’m not sure if it’s the best time for Vez to be learning that right now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I disagree, I believe it to be at the very foundation of magic. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really, what could magic possibly have to do with that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So what is used to cast magic?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Mana, I guess… in this world we count it as MP. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, it is known as magic element in this world. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Magic element?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, it is that which fuels all spells. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh so it was something like that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, for example when you want to cast a spell, it requires a certain chant. That chant guides the magic element in a manner which matches your intentions. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… how interesting. Then is this magic element something sentient?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra I’ll be trying to explain it to Vez so please bear with me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure sure teacher, but it seems it’s a bit complex for Vez, no?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think I somewhat understand it, it’s just like the vibrations when you talk. I remember when I would speak but my head was lying down on the bed, I could feel some vibrations. Is it something like that?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Exactly Vez, When you say something, it causes vibrations. It’s these vibrations which act as a trigger for the magic element, in turn resulting in the spell you wanted to cast.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then what about magic spells that are cast without any chants?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“For those instant cast spells, willpower is used as a substitute for sound, like some kind of EEG. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“EEG?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“A scan which monitors electrical</p>
<p>Delaila placed a sheet of paper on her hand, and through the emission of light managed to get it to vibrate. I feel that it was something only androids like her could achieve.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow Dad! Look at sister Delaila’s hands!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can only get to a frequency of about 30. Can you notice some differences on this paper?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes sister! Depending on the area of the paper the vibrations can be faster or slower.</p>
<p>Vez watched attentively with her glowing eyes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“In fact every substance in this world has its own frequency at which it vibrates. These vibrations affect each other and result in magic element, or the interconnectedness of this entire world. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was incredibly surprised by this latest revelation.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Any material can vibrate and therefore be subject to some form of magic. It is the chant which dictates how it will react and then the composition of magic elements acts as the trigger, allowing the magic to manifest itself. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow! With sister’s explanation it’s so easy to understand. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt a bit awkward having such a genius daughter, seeing as I still found this answer to be quite complex.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So in fact for there isn’t any one specific magic element? Any spell it can be cast without speaking right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s right Johra, all the material in the world share a root magic element. in order to get a spell off. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then by that logic, if you were to be in a vacuum then it should be impossible to cast magic. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We would would need to try an experiment in that scenario. Perhaps which your ability to create materials we can set it up. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was still struggling with Lena’s theory of magic. All that about applying advanced math and physics to create a magical circuit to guide the magic elements basically went in one ear and out the other. Vez on the other hand was like a sponge, immediately absorbing and understanding all new knowledge with a happy smile on her face.</p>
<p>It was a treat to see how smart my daughter truly was, but it was sad that I had to pretend to totally understand so as not to lose any face as her father.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, Mommy!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda walked into the room and Vez jumped into her arms.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Have have you been little one?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m hungry!”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was her feeding time so Viezda came to breast feed her. I was tempted to join in, but feared that Vez would get jealous and not want to share.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What are you up to Melpomene!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Returning to my lab I caught her fiddling with the necklace I had gained from Jeduth. When she heard my voice, she instantly put it around her neck.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master it’s my destiny. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What are you talking about? That isn’t yours to wear!”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 109</p>
<p><strong><i>“Get down on your knees Melpomene!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Holding her chest in pain, she had no choice but to obey due to the slave contract.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Explain to me why you’ve done this. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I speak out viciously, hardly able to rein in my anger.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It is because of one of my brother’s prophecies. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What prophecy is that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It is that the wearer of this necklace is sure to die. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, okay then. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Placing my hand on her heart I cast my skil.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Create Material: Arsenic”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Kuh…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I placed the Arsenic directly into her heart, causing her to vomit violently and faint shortly after.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, could you confirm her death?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“She has gone into cardiac arrest, but there’s still some slight brain activity; however, the arsenic is blocking all neurotransmitters so it won’t be long now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How long until she is completely dead?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“2 minutes and 14 seconds until she is clinically dead. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Holding Melpomene’s corpse in my arms, I look down in sadness.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What a troublesome prophecy. I’d die if I were to wear the necklace? But if I were to wear it then I couldn’t take it off until I had ascended to Godhood?”</i></strong></p>
<p>As Melpomene’s life force slipped away, the necklace revealed itself once more. I tried to reach out and grab it but it vanished as I got close.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess it isn’t all that simple. I should hurry up and complete the Killion dungeon. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, all signs of life have faded, she’s dead. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, Lena please seal the room. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sound waves and light rays are blocked, and Rohim’s shield is now activated. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I began to cast my Resurrection Song. It was a beautiful melody which I would otherwise be completely incapable of reproducing. The spell seeped into her body causing her to bask in a golden nimbus. After about thirty minutes into the spell she once again drew her first breath.</p>
<p>Drawing out a chair I sat down and began to read a book titled, Genealogy of Gods, waiting for her to wake up.</p>
<p>It took some time, but she finally gained consciousness and mustered the power to ask.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Um… didn’t I die?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, you did die. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So I died and now I’m a ghost?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I didn’t let that happen, You deceived me so I can’t let you off that easily. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I spoke with a grim tone, but hearing my response, Melpomene couldn’t help but let out a few weak chuckles.</p>
<p>“Did</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why didn’t you just leave me die?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I require the necklace you have around your neck. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think it’s gone now though. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, it’s still there, it just doesn’t want to be seen. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess just saying sorry isn’t enough right?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene was giving me her sad puppy eyes but my heart was not easily swayed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then are you curious to know why? Why it is I wore the necklace?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, you just told me that the wearer would die. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, it was set to happen today, the 95th day after your child was born. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So you even knew the exact date, how did you learn of the necklace’s location?”</i></strong></p>
<p>There wa this one time which I heard of a conversation between you and big sister, discussing the necklace. I then learned that you had it stashed in the lab and after coming here on several occasions, I was able to confirm its exact location.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, just what kind of security measures do you actually have in place?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, last time you told me not to monitor those close to you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hm, I vaguely recalled saying something along those lines.</p>
<p><strong><i>“At least that prophecy has been completed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, all thanks to you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The moment I wore the necklace I learned the require conditions to become a god. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘So it seems that you can only know the information once you wear it. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Tell me what the requirements are. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It was to kill all those close to you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The price to pay for Godhood was quite steep indeed. I’m glad that hadn’t worn the necklace and been faced with such a dilemma.</p>
<p><strong><i>“As expected, it isn’t so easy to become a God. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you already know?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So that’s why you have yet to try it on. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“But master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What is it?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think that the curse has changed since I’ve died and come back to life. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Oh, can death cause the curse to change? That’s quite advantageous for us considering that I can easily revive her. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So what kind of curse is it?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I need to sleep with one million men. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘So the conditions aren’t only related to deaths. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master do you truly need this necklace back?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see. Then I’ll give it back, just give me some time please. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How will you manage to give it back?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I just told you, I need to just sleep with one million men, then</p>
<p><strong><i>“Uh…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although she had betrayed me to some extent, it was not to the point where I’d want her to lay with one million men. Not to mention that we’d already had sex and Viezda would be terribly disappointed if she ever found out.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You’ve already betrayed me once, but as if that wasn’t enough you want to now sleep with one million more men after having shared the same bed? I won’t allow it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then what should I do?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Die. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“You will die and die again until the appropriate curse appears. Become a god and serve me in order to atone for the sins you’ve committed. This is now your path going forward.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… you’re saying it like that, but isn’t it because you also have some feelings for me?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene had a delightful smile learning that I didn’t what her to sleep with other men, but it was still a bit awkward since I had basically sentenced her to multiple deaths.</p>
<p>Since that day we’ve only slept two hours per day, spending the rest of the time killing and then reviving Melpomene. After repeated uses we managed to perfect it down to an art, by which I killed her in the quickest and least painful manner, causing my Resurrection Song to jumped to Level 4.</p>
<p>In that manner the next nine months flew by, and it was Veznos’ first year birthday.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Happy birthday Veznos!”</i></strong></p>
<p>The large dining hall was decorate with bright colors. It was the best birthday I had ever attended in this world.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Congrats Vez, here I prepared this for you!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian handed her a chess set which he had personally carved.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow! What is this?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Vez now had the knowledge of a junior high school student, and the body of a five year old due to her Rapid Growth. The combination of genes from a MoonElf and a Meta Human gave her an incredible boost in learning ability.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s called Chess. It’s a game which master first showed us, and now you can play it as well. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The eyes of the Princess and Jerna began to shine. Soon they would have another worthy adversary.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I prepared this one for you Vez. I was a bit worried about how fast your hair was growing, so here you are. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna handed her a dark red hairpin which matched beautifully with Vez’s sleek blonde hair.</p>
<p>“Wow! It’s perfect,</p>
<p>Jerna nodded back excitedly and helped her put it on.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… I wasn’t able to prepare anything special, despite you being the daughter of the man who saved me. …”</i></strong></p>
<p>She handed Vez a jewelry box which she had kept on her since her days in the palace.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sister princess, this is too much so I can’t accept it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Vez was already wise enough to refuse such an expensive gift.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, I’ve been trying to put my past behind me, so you’d actually be helping me out by relieving me of such a burden. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Dad?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, you can accept her gift. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thank you sister princess, I’ll cherish it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After that every servant in the manor handed out their own gifts, and Vez would have a beaming smile every time. As her father, seeing so happy naturally brought a smile to my face as well.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This is all I have to give you. ”</i></strong> Melpomene slowly made her way to the middle of the hall and began singing in her rich and pure elven voice.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Uhm… isn’t this song…. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, isn’t this similar to your Resurrection Song?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena and I both had the same question as we were able to find several similarities between them.</p>
<p>Melpomene’s song was so similar to my Ressurection Song, but others would never be able to recognize that fact.</p>
<p>Her lyrics spoke of the gods and the sorrow of humans. It was a clash between eternity and mortality. We all listened with rapt attention, staring at Melpomene sing.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, look at Vez. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda came over and leaned her head on my shoulder. We both turned to look at Vez who was now shining in a bright blue light.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, did you say Vez was a Demi God?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think that light represents her feelings, so she must be very happy right now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Viezda put her arms around my waist at looked at our daughter with a smile. We were both content, seeing our daughter express such a big smile.</p>
<p>I was even happy with Melpomene’s performance, despite her earlier betrayal. Naturally that didn’t change the fact that I had to kill her later that night.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Why are you hesitating, Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I had already killed her countless times, but for some reason tonight was different.</p>
<p>‘Is it really so important for me to become a God? Can’t I find some middle ground with the High-Gods and achieve a compromise?</p>
<p>Ugggg</p>
<p>While I was contemplating any further actions, Melpomene went ahead and decisively and stabbed her carotid artery.</p>
<p>Devastated, I look down at her. I needed her to die but was unable to do it by my own hand. I stood there, looking at her corpse for a few seconds, sighing and my own weakness and praising her decisiveness.</p>
<p>After resurrecting her she spoke out in a cheery voice, unlike that of someone who had just come back from the dead.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, I think this time is the one. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>We would usually repeat this process 10 times per night, so she had experienced death roughly 2700 times over the past nine months.</p>
<p>“It was certainly painful to die, both physically and mentally exhausting. Although it wasn’t easy on my end to kill someone I cared for, it was still much harder to do the actual dying part. And yet, she was strong enough to go ahead and commit suicide herself, knowing that it would relieve my mind on the burden of doing it myself. After experiencing this last one, I had chosen to put and end to this farce, but as luck would have it, a miracle occured.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you sure?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I answered Melpomene.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I think it shouldn’t be too hard to satisfy these conditions. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What is it this time?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“To experience 100,000 deaths”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What? 100,000 times!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll get started. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wait. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Kuhh</p>
<p>She once again cut her own carotid artery, before I could finish talking. Through the countless experiments we had done, we learned that the smaller the injury, the quicker it was to resurrect her; therefore slitting the carotid artery was the most efficient way.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Uh… but didn’t the conditions reset after every death? I guess we can only find out once she comes back to life. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>After a short time she once again opened her eyes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you awake Melpomene?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you ok? Did the condition change?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene shook her head and answered.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve completed the first death. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Is this some kind of special condition? It must be that this is a special case. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>Kuhh</p>
<p>Melpomene once again killed herself without giving me the chance to get another word in.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Melpomene’s become a pro at dying…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>And so we spent that night in a cycle of death and resurrection, creating a new record.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 110</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master I think that there are only 10,000 left. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene swiftly cut her own carotid artery once more after informing me. We had managed to achieve 1,000 deaths per day, for a total of 90,000 deaths in 90 days. I was now spending more than half of my day, about 15 hours, repeating this process of death and resurrection.</p>
<p>At first our excuse was that Melpomene also wanted to have a child, but now it was getting harder and harder to explain. Thanks to this my odd titles had all reached maximum and most people around me took me for a lecherous pervert.</p>
<p>I now only took about 50 to 55 seconds to complete the cycle of Melpomene’s death and resurrection. Due to this extreme repetition my Resurrection Song skill hit max.</p>
<p>On Melpomene’s end it was simply dying over and over again, with hardly any time for words in between. After having repeated it for over 90,000 times, it had become like a mechanical process, and the boundaries between life and death seemed nonexistent.</p>
<p>Death, resurrection and then death once more.</p>
<p>An endless cycle which neither took into account the respect for life or the solemness of death.</p>
<p>After undergoing such a unique experience, I began to question my beliefs.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘What is is death? What is life? Just what is the meaning behind them if one can so easily be resurrected. Is there no soul? Why is it that in a world where Gods are actually present that there is no mention of the soul?’</i></strong></p>
<p>As I was pondering these questions Melpomene died a few more times.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, after all these deaths it seems that you’re still overthinking things. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>She didn’t forget to immediately off herself after finishing her sentence. She had truly mastered the art of suicide. At first I was the one to do it, but she quickly took over as she was more efficient and ruthless towards herself.</p>
<p>Due to this she gained the title <strong><i>[Suicide Addict LvMax]</i></strong>. Although I would previously be affected to a certain extent with the death of a sentient being, after being exposed to so many deaths, I no longer felt so touched.</p>
<p>I had also discovered a truly interesting fact. If one were to die, but then</p>
<p>Due to this, Melpomene was able to evolve several times. From High Elf to Royal High Elf. then on to Arch Elf and finally Demi Elf. She was now just a step away from Godhood.</p>
<p>Nevertheless her curse had yet to disappear. Perhaps it was so strong that it would only disappear once she became a God.</p>
<p>The time it took me to think of this Melpomene had already died another 10 times, and in this manner we passed our entire night, up until the early morning.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Melpomene, let’s stop here for now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There are only about 9,000 times left, don’t you want to regain your necklace as soon as possible?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, I’m not in much of a hurry. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then please go back first, Master. I’ll stay back and clean up the blood. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I left her behind in the lab, with the task of cleaning up the monstrous amount of blood which had spilled on the floor.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena… the morning sunlight is a bit too bright. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra that isn’t my doing, it’s…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Dad!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh! Vez!”</i></strong></p>
<p>She rushed into my embrace my and I was hit with a bright golden light. Vez had already grown to the size of junior high schooler and would emit different colours depending on her mood.</p>
<p>Her present golden light represented great joy.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dad! Dad! I finally won a game versus sister. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Over the last 3 months she had developed a liking for the game of chess. Of course at first she wasn’t close to being a difficult opponent, but she learned quickly and just one month ago she overcame Jillian, and today she finally</p>
<p>“Congrats Vez! Jerna is very strong at chess.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Isn’t she just average though? Dad’s chess ability is the best in the world right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… about that…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt a bit bad about the deception.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra you know that someday you’ll have to come clean about it…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena spoke to me covertly, but I simply ignored her.</p>
<p>For a little while longer I wanted to keep up the appearance of a super dad.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Even in chess there is a luck factor, so don’t get too ahead of yourself after just one win. There is always a stronger opponent waiting for you out there. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yup, you are so right. Even princess Mayardus is much stronger than Jerna, I have no chance against her. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, the princess is good at chess. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“By the way, who is Lilinor? I heard about this mysterious sister who is even stronger in chess. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… she’s a friend of your dad’s, but we haven’t seen each other in quite some time. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, I hope that I can meet her some day!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Truly?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I promise. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>In the past I would hold in contempt those fathers which were unable to refuse any of their daughter’s requests, but it appears that I had somehow joined their ranks.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dad will you be going to bed now?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It feels like you spend your entire days playing with big sister Melpomene, you should rest more often. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I’ll do that. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Allowing Vez to lead me to our bedroom, I walked in to join Viezda who was resting after her morning exercises.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra are you tired?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Biezda stared into my eyes lovingly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m sorry about all this Viezda. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, not at all. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You see…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I just hope that this remains a phase and that it doesn’t last too long. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It was terrible misunderstanding, but I decided to let it rest for now. Still I knew that I would have to soon explain myself to her so that she wouldn’t feel too sad.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It should be ending shortly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was running out of good excuses, but luckily she didn’t press the issue.</p>
<p>I took a short three hour nap to catch up on some much needed rest, before getting up and preparing myself to attack the Killion dungeon with my party members</p>
<p>At this point we had already reached the 30th floor in the dungeon and had left a teleportation array there during our last visit. We continued to search in areas which had yet to be mapped out by other adventurers.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master you said we’d be looking for a Gargoyle creature with crimson wings?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I saw it the other time, it was holding what looked like a grimoire in its hand. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then if we catch him can we take the book and learn more magic from it?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna asked curiously.</p>
<p>I nodded back and answered.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It should be the case, but it’s rather hard to locate. Still, there have been several sighting of it over time, so if we take our time to explore carefully and our patient we should encounter it in the end. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Everyone nodded back and continued their hunting.</p>
<p>Naturally Jillian had already followed in my footsteps as a Meta Human and Jerna had become a High Human. Both of their levels had also increased considerably. On the Princess’ side she had become a Nosferatu. Unfortunately they suffered from the same leveling penalty which I had experienced as a Demi Lich, so despite the thousands of monsters we had slain, her experience was slightly lower than the other two.</p>
<p>To a certain extent it made a lot of sense seeing as she was now an immortal being, she would have a lot more time to level up compared to humans, so a certain balance was justified. It seemed that this sort of balancing act only appeared as one progressed in the higher tier evolutions.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Level has reached the Maximum]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Evolution is now Possible]</i></strong></p>
<p>Finally my long awaited evolution arrived</p>
<p>As a Meta Human the last few levels were truly demanding, and it ended taking me a whole year and nine months before maxing out.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh… so is it finally time to evolve?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master did you manage to max out your level?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Once Jillian evolved into a Meta Human he had gained the ability to fly and control fire. According to Lena it matched the abilities of the superhero Human Torch. However it seems like he had gained an additional super hearing ability, as seen by the fact that he heard me murmuring to myself while in the midst of fighting a monster.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Finally!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s your evolution Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna and</p>
<p>Jerna and Mayardus walked over after clearing the nearby monsters and asked curiously.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Just give me a break would you…. ”</i></strong></p>

<p>★</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, what the hell?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Demi Human is easy enough to guess. It’s probably the same meaning as Demi Lich which means it’s just one step away from becoming a God. But what is this Leader of the Fallen? Sounds like some childish title, and what about Revenant?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can evolve into a Demi Human. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I didn’t announce my other choices. I didn’t want to say anything before fully understanding what these options meant.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then will you evolve?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If you choose to evolve I will protect you Johra!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, you can count on me too!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian and Jerna seemed super motivated but I simply shook my head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s head back for now, I’m pretty tired. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What happened you didn’t sleep well last night?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Following Jerna’s question, princess Mayardus sported her crooked smile. This was certainly another one of those misunderstandings.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess so…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Unwilling to explain I simply sigh in despair and activate the teleportation magic.</p>
<p>I’ll go rest so you guys take the chance to further your studies with Lena.</p>
<p>The three of them gave me a knowing smile as I headed back to the bedroom.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘So it’s between a Demi Human and two unknowns like Leader of the Fallen and Revenant, how troublesome. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 111</p>
<p><strong><i>‘For Melpomene it seems that even if she’s definitely hit max level, she isn’t able to evolve further. Could evolutions have some sort of cap? Could it be due to the cursed necklace or maybe even her original curse? It might even be that there exists a certain limiter in our genes which don’t allow us to cross a certain threshold and challenge the Gods. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>It was an important fundamental question.</p>
<p>A Demi Human was at the end of the day a knock off of a real God. Such a half heartedness would never allow me to gain the power I required to challenge the High Gods.</p>
<p>Revenant sounded like one which involved an endless amount of grinding. If my goal was not one of vengeance against the gods, then perhaps it would have been a good choice.</p>
<p>All that remained was the Leader of the Fallen.</p>
<p>It was in fact the only viable option in my eyes. It was neither a race nor a profession and looking back through history there didn’t exist any record of it. Of course I had a certain amount of doubt towards it, after all to date I had blindly jumped into two evolutions. The first was the Enchanter, which although it was an interesting path, in the end it was quite useless. The second was the Demi Lich. I was completely caught unaware with its powers. Although it was indeed a strong evolution, if one is unable to properly control his powers, then it would only lead to his downfall.</p>
<p>Looking back in the past at those occasions where I had blindly picked my evolutions, I realised that I had been quite lucky.</p>
<p>I was once again in that very same scenario, so it was time to gamble once more.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, let’s do it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Recently my teenager spirit had begun to resurface.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess that at worst I’ll be treated as a bigger pervert. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt a rush as I finally decided on my evolution. Of course I did so knowing that I still had my Species Conversion ability as a trump card.</p>

<p>Also those shameful titles have all disappeared and had merged into Corrupt Lv1</p>
<p><strong><i>“So what the hell just happened?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was unconsciously grabbing onto the bed mattress when it simply disintegrated into dust.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Destroyer of Creation level 1 ➢ 2]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Just what is this destruction ability?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stared at the pile of dust which just seconds ago had been my bed mattress with a stupefied expression.</p>
<p>I then tried it out on some other items in the room before I became completely convinced.</p>
<p>“Johra it seems to be an ability which accelerates the decay of material by influencing time. I can detect a rapid decline in the emission of radioactivity in those materials.</p>
<p>“Yes I was also thinking along those lines.</p>
<p>It was a strange ability which could accelerate the decay of any objects I touched. Although it sounded like it was a truly powerful weapon, I wondered if it was one which I could control.</p>
<p>“Although it is very strong, it is meaningless against the Gods since they are immortal.</p>
<p>I muttered to myself unhappily as I left the room and headed towards my underground lab.</p>
<p>We still had to continue Melpomene cycle of death and resurrection.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master I heard that you finally evolved today right? That’s great news, but let’s continue!”</i></strong></p>
<p>As soon as she said those words she instantly killed herself. We could only continue talking after she’d resurrected.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I evolved but it isn’t anything special. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>This curse should be ending soon, so I asked her when she next revived.</p>
<p><strong><i>“How much is left?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“9812 times. These days our efficiency has dropped so it should take</p>
<p>I saw Melpomene die as I whispered to myself.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Still 15 more days of this…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>We went on through the night like a couple of machines, an endless cycle of death and revival. Due to my recent evolution my skills had disappeared which slowed down our progress considerably.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s stop here, I’m tired. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I only died a few times today, at this speed I’m not sure when we can finish, 크크크. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Melpomene laughed weirdly, but her appearance had changed drastically compared to when we first started. She had deep dark circles around her eyes and her face was very pale.</p>
<p>Viezda would occasionally ask if I was overdoing it a little bit, but I couldn’t now fix this misunderstanding. Once you’ve started on a certain path with a lie, you had no choice but to see it through to the end.</p>
<p>I’ve already given up everything for this, crossing a line which human shouldn’t ever cross. I was also feeling the burden no more than ever after my latest evolution, so I simply headed to our bedroom to crash.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, what’s wrong Viezda?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why’s the bed gone Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had completely forgotten about disintegrating the bed earlier today. Viezda was now lying down on a futon which had stretched out on the floor. Vez was probably learning form Lena along with the other three.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry about that Viez, I had completely forgotten about it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No worries, sleeping on the ground like this isn’t so bad, it brings back memories of the olden days. Well, I say olden days but it only really has been about two years. Come lie down, you look tired. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yea, I’ll just take a quick snooze. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I ended up sleeping for quite some time. I used to have skills which helped restore my condition and lower fatigue, but this was no longer the case.</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes once more, I woke up to the sight of Viezda’s charming sleeping face.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That was quite the nap. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You slept for exactly 11 hours, 23 minutes and 17 seconds. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena’s timely report soon followed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh, and I still feel beat up. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After some minor complaints, it was time for us to continue in the Killion dungeon.</p>
<p>‘So although I can’t gain experience, at least</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you evolve, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What was the evolution? Is it some continuation of a Meta Human? I wonder If I’ll one day get there a well,”</i></strong>Jillian continued.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s nothing special, just the ability to crush stuff. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I picked up a rock and gave them a demonstration.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh~ that’s a pretty cool ability, Master!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but it’s quite useless. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Isn’t that ability strong though? Can you crush absolutely anything?”</i></strong> Jerna asked in admiration.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m not sure, there doesn’t seem to be a cap on the skill level so…. maybe?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was still wondering if this effect would extend to Gods as well.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘I guess I might as well grind it just in case. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>Whenever there was some downtime I would pick stuff up and crush them. Be monster corpses or stones, anything did the trick.</p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Corrupter of Creation Lv1｠]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Corrupter of Creation? I guess it’s pretty self explanatory. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>Since then I continued to raise the skill Destroyer of Creation until finally the last day of the Melpomene killing cycle arrived.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra this should be the last time. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Really?</p>
<p>The moment Melpomene died for the 10,000th time, a deathly black fog began to form around her body.</p>
<p>I hadt cast out Resurrection Song as a reflex, which might have interrupted her current transformation.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I hope all goes well…”</i></strong></p>
<p>The black fog and a certain golden light all began to circle her corpse. In the end the black fog began seeping into her body until there wasn’t any left.</p>
<p>Hhhhhaa</p>
<p>She came back to life, but her eyes were a creepy pitch black.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, I’ve become a God. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The necklace reappeared around her neck as she looked at me with those eyes devoid of any emotions.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I can now see that you aren’t a living creature, Johra. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Melpomene?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, you shouldn’t call me by that name anymore. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What then?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“My name is Thanatos, the one which embodies the will of Death. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Thanatos huh?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra there were some myths back on Earth in which Death was personified by a God. It’s symbol was that it projected suicidal thoughts. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Even without Lena’s explanation I was able to guess this much. It was the birth of the God of Death Thanatos, after having experienced death 100,000 times.</p>
<p>I was no longer</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hm… so what do you plan on doing now Melpo… no, Thanatos?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t know, what ever you require of me, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Huh? Master?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you still regard me as your owner? Is this some kind of joke?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Not at all, you will forever be my master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Even though you are now a God?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Didn’t you know? Among Gods it is even more important to stand by your word. I will forever be Johra’s slave, and this fact can’t be changed unless you decide to throw me aside. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Jackpot! I now have a God as a slave. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that so?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If you think I’m lying you need only ask me to do something to prove my loyalty. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I gazed at Thanatos but couldn’t help but think of Melpomene.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, that won’t be necessary. Can you see now?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t think this is a human’s sight, but I can see in my own way. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Great!. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then I’ll hand this over to you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos removed her necklace and handed it to me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Finally got it back, it’s certainly given me quite the trouble and could have caused my death. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If I didn’t have Master’s help I would have suffered at the hands of the Gods’ curse for all eternity. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess that’s true, but in the end you also underwent quite a traumatizing experience. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, you can call upon me whenever you’d like, I’m entirely yours to command. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Uh… thank you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You and I share a bond deeper than that of a Master and slave. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You’ll know about it soon enough. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Go see sister for now. At the moment I can’t appear in front of humans. Except for when Vez is around, I’d negatively influence other creatures. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Influence?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, such as giving them suicidal thoughts. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>What a terrifying ability.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Alright, but what do I tell the others?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I think it would be best to say that the woman name Melpomene ran away.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you okay with that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve already disintegrated all which belonged Melpomene when I became a God. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I still have you. Which is the most important thing for me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt her burning desire behind those pitch black eyes..</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 112</p>
<p>Thanatos had vanished after that day. Well, in truth she wasn’t so much gone, but rather became invisible and dogged my every step. Although I didn’t know the full extent of her powers, she was sure to be useful. Also, it was good to know that no one else could see her besides myself.</p>
<p>The problem was that regardless of where I went, she was sure to follow.</p>
<p>The bedroom was a given, the lab, during dinner and even while I was bathing or in the restroom.</p>
<p>Just imagine a God of Death hovering beside you, watching your every move.</p>
<p>The only situation where she couldn’t stay by my side was when Vez wasn’t around</p>
<p>I was the only time which I was free of Thanatos.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jillian, Jerna, Mayardus, don’t stray too far from me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master. Are you expecting it to become dangerous?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmph! I’m not that weak. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Although Jillian was quick to accept my concerns, the Princess was too proud. She was also a Nosferatu which was an elite vampire, so her strength was decent. At a B+ rank, she was almost on the level of a regular dragon.</p>
<p>At the moment we were clearing a floor of the Killion dungeon which none had previously come to, but my assistance wasn’t at all required. Over the past year my party members have really gained a lot of experience and strength, becoming first rate adventurers.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Jerna, get ready there are a group of lizardmen ahead. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Mayardus was the first to notice the enemy with her enhanced perception. Jerna’s class had already advanced to an Archmage.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Spirits of Ice heed my call, descend and freeze all before us!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Following her spell the dozens of Lizardmen who were charging towards us were instantly rooted in place, having become monster popsicles. Lizardmen were genetically modified creatures so they were quite weak towards ice magic.</p>
<p><strong><i>“My turn, Firestorm!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian had the same mastery of the fire element just like the Human Torch did. Only it was different from conventional, but rather some esper ability. Unlike regular magic which usually existed as an external force, Jillian could even control</p>
<p>Hwarrrrr</p>
<p>Kieeek Kieek</p>
<p>According to Lena’s readings his Firestorm reached up to 2,000 degrees Celsius. Between the Ice magic, Firestorm and Mayardus personally piercing their hearts with her bare hands, The group of Lizardmen were quickly taken care of.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What do you think, Johra? Still worried about us?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If there was something to worry about, it wouldn’t be versus some puny Lizardmen. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Truth, I the reason I wanted them close to me was to keep Thanatos away, but I couldn’t very well tell them that.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra seems to be staying quite close to us ever since Melpomen escaped, are you thinking that we will also run away?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s not…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian cut Jerna of, but the Princess continued.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That was Johra’s fault for overdoing it with her. Melpomene must have suffered too much at his hands so her running away is justified since she must have feared for her life. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I saw Thanatos give me a creepy smile from afar.</p>
<p>“It’s fine if she escaped because I can still know where she is and that she’s safe. I’m in no hurry to go and fetch her and I’m willing to leave her alone.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What, did you go so far as planting some tracking device on her?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jerna asked me somewhat bewildered.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well it’s for her safety. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s okay Johra, we won’t run away from you, we’ve already sworn to serve you until the day we die. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was touched by the Princess’ comment, but was worried that she’d later become like Thanatos.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Want to continue? I was planning on going a bit further today. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I understand, hurry along Jerna. Princess, you too. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Everyone nodded at Jillian’s suggestion, and we all headed deeper into the dungeon.</p>
<p>We had already achieved the limit of what had previously been mapped out in the Killion Dungeon, but hadn’t discovered any path which led to the deepest levels.</p>
<p>Two of the five paths hadn’t yet been explored, so it should be in one of those two.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Will we do the blue today?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hadn’t we decided on the red?”</i></strong></p>
<p>At each of the five entrances, the magic circles leading in had a certain magic jewel placed</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’d prefer the blue one…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How about we let the majority decide?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s a majority?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh, you don’t know about the majority?”</i></strong> It’s when you choose something based on what most people picked. ”</p>
<p>It seemed that democracy hadn’t yet appeared in this world.</p>
<p><strong><i>“If you decide that way, then won’t the few whose opinions were ignored, complain?”</i></strong> The Princess asked coldly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, but if you follow the opinion on the few and ignore the many, won’t it be the many complaining instead?”</i></strong> I countered.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t know, in such situations isn’t it easiest to ask what is the God’s will?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master has such unique ideas. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Let’s give it a try, so how is it done?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Princess ended up agreeing in the end and it was put up for a vote.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Blue! Today’s color is blue. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The sapphire magic array was the one which we expected to go the deepest.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Does this one lead to a next stage?”</i></strong></p>
<p>In these dungeons the transition area between stages was usually protected by a boss monster.</p>
<p>This time around we arrived at tunnel which only one path which was being guarded by a huge black dragon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t see any other way round it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back worriedly. Although the three look excited to face off against a dragon, I knew that their recent success had gotten to their heads and that they were not its opponent.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, it wouldn’t be too bad for them to suffer a setback or two. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The dragon can likely speak so why don’t we try communicating with it first?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it possible that it would let us through without a fight?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I nodded back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“There is still a chance of settling this peacefully. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Has it happened to you before?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah… so what should I tell it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately things didn’t go as expected since it never even bothered responding.</p>
<p>Kooooooooh</p>
<p>As soon as we approached the dragon began to breathe in deeply.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn, get behind me, it’ll launch a dragon breath!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, but then what about you, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Spirit…”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“ Jerna! Quit fooling around and get behind me. Princess, you too!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Pooooah!</p>
<p>I stepped forward to</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thor’s Thunder! Thor’s Thunder! Thor’s Thunder!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Pazzik! Paaazik!</p>
<p>The three lightning bolts struck behind me. The Rohim shield was barely able to cope with the Lv. 9 dragon breath and shattered instantly when faced with the three lightning spells.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry Johra, I wasn’t able to block those spells, they overwhelmed the shield far too quickly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I looked behind me and saw three charred corpses. Only the Princess’ was twitching ever so slightly due to the enhanced vitality of the Nosferatu, but it would still take quite the long time to resurrect.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dam you Krishna! How dare you kill my disciples!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Kung Kung Kung</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ho ho~ My breath was blocked by a mere mortal, not to mention that you even know my name. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The black dragon Krishna eyed me curiously as it approached. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“You don’t seem to be afraid of me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I quickly reached out to its giant maw which was now within arms reach and grabbed hold of an exposed tooth.</p>
<p>Phaassss</p>
<p>The dragon which had previously been confident that its defenses could never be breached by a mere human, now scuttled back in fear.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What… you can’t be human! Are you a Messiah? No, it can’t be, the seal of the Gods is still in place so you wouldn’t be able to enter if that were the case. Just what are you?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It had backed off cautiously, staring at me from a distance of one hundred meters.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Just stay there quietly like a good little boy. If you move, you’re dead. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I turned my back to him and began casting my Resurrection Song.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You dare turn you back to me, the incarnation of death and destruction? Ha ha, I’ll crush you like the little bug that you are!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Kung Kung Kung</p>
<p>It angrily rushed towards me in an attempt to stomp on me.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Huh? Why did the dragon stop? Of course the Rohim shield had been raised to its maximum power so there shouldn’t be a problem, but it couldn’t have known that. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>“Johra the black dragon seems to be lowering its head</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hmm… bowing down? Oh, right. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>I remembered that Thanatos was still nearby.</p>
<p>Black dragons were said to represent death and destruction, so it was only natural for it to be subservient towards the God of Death,Thanatos.</p>
<p>Kuuuooo… How come you can hear me?”</p>
<p>I bunch of loud sounds originated from behind me, but I couldn’t turn to take a look or it would interrupt my Resurrection Song.</p>
<p>“Johra the dragon was just blown up into thousands of pieces.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘What…. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>Finally my spell ended. It would still take some time for the three to regain consciousness, but they would surely be shocked by the scene before them.</p>
<p><strong><i>“There are pieces of flesh everywhere. …”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How are you doing, Master? I put that rude fellow into its place so I deserve some praise right?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos lowered her head expectantly, perhaps wanting to be petted.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… you did well, but I was hoping to use it to temper my disciples. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I rubbed her head with an expression of regret.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… I didn’t know. time I’ll leave it half dead instead. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“No, just don’t attack it at all. These young kids won’t grow if you deal with every troublesome situation. A difficult opponent is a chance to stimulate their growths.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh~ Master’s wisdom is beyond compare. I’m so silly so allow me to punish myself. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Shaak!</p>
<p>Thanatos instantly severed one of her arms and presented it to me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Please accept the apologies of this incompetent slave. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I frowned seeing her severed limb.</p>
<p><strong><i>“In the future don’t do that again. You belong to me in your entirety, so you can’t hurt yourself without my permission. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Forgive me… I was too impulsive, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Stop that Thanatos, my disciples will soon wake up. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master, I’ll continue to observe from afar. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos vanished as quickly as she had appeared.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Huu. the biggest stalker ever, just what has my life devolved into. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>As i muttered to myself, the three of them finally woke up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh… what happened?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master where did the dragon go?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How are you…. wait, weren’t we fighting a black dragon?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Um… how should I explain this?”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 113</p>
<p><strong><i>“We had all died previously right?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Actually the Princess hadn’t died, but rather lost consciousness due to her severe injuries.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes you were all dead. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then how is it that we are alive and well now?”</i></strong></p>
<p>They all looked towards me, pressing me for an answer.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘I guess they’ll find out eventually anyways so it couldn’t hurt to let them know now. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve saved you. I can cast a revival spell, as long as there hasn’t been too much time that has passed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>They stared at me, shocked into silence.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra the ability to resurrect others has always been exclusive to the Green Elder dragon. Throughout history there has never been another, not even among the Gods. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Princess Mayardus answered with a hint of uncertainty.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well if one can do it what is so strange about another person having the same ability?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is there even anything that’s impossible when it comes to master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra what about the black dragon? How did you deal with it?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I shook my head in regards to Jenna’s question. It hadn’t been my doing.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I have no idea. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I told myself that I wasn’t entirely untrue seen as I hadn’t seen it happen. Just a simple white lie to protect certain secrets.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, then is it possible to resurrect the black dragon as well?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If I were to do that won’t it just attack us once more?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I asked the Princess following here question, but she shook her head in response.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I heard that dragons will always repay any favor shown. So even if you were considered an enemy before, it is sure to follow you if you save its life. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Hmm… I didn’t get the same vibe I did from Valenor and Lilinor. Is it because it’s the dragon of death and destruction?”</p>
<p>Hearing the Princess’ suggestion I suddenly became eager to have the black dragon as a servant under my control.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘It would be hard to pull it off though, the amount of damage caused affects the difficulty of the resurrection. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Help me gather the pieces of its body and we will try to assemble back once more. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It took half a day even with the help of all three of them because Thanatos had thoroughly blasted it into thousands of pieces. I also had to try and collect and purify as much of the dragon blood which had spilt on the ground, making the task even harder.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Everyone, close your eyes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It wasn’t that I was doing something secret, but rather that I was shy to be caught singing in front of others.</p>
<p>The Resurrection Song</p>
<p>Grrrr…</p>
<p>The dragon finally emitted a soft growl, showing some sign of stirring.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s alive!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Have you done it, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How incredible!”</i></strong></p>
<p>The three were finally allowed to open their eyes and shouted in surprise.</p>
<p>I was still a bit wary though at stared carefully at slumbering dragon which was about twenty meters away.</p>
<p>After about thirty minutes it finally opened its eyes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Was it you who rescued me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Simply because I could. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… I’ve already been abandoned by my God, I no longer have any reason to live on anymore. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Black dragon, are you the kind of being that wouldn’t repay the favor he’s shown you?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing the Princess’ accusation he turned to look at me unwillingly. ”</p>
<p>Are you willing to accept this poor, half dead servant?”</p>
<p>I nodded back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then I shall from here on out abandon this living body, Polymorph!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Quaaaaa</p>
<p>A large black sword appeared in place of the dragon. As It fell down to the ground it sunk in considerably causing a large tremor in the cave.</p>
<p>I opened up the sword’s status page.</p>
<p>★</p>
<p>Name: Krishna</p>
<p>Damage: 6,666</p>
<p>Durability: 7,213,112/7,213,112</p>

<p><strong><i>[Summon Lv7]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Magic Enhancement LvMax]</i></strong></p>
<p>★</p>
<p><strong><i>“What? Did you become a sword?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Please pick me up, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I approached slowly and grasped the hilt. With a tug I was able to lift it, but despite my strength I felt it was quite heavy.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Since you can wield me, then I’ll properly recognize you as my master. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[Acquired ｟Title: Krishna’s Master｠]</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Master is that sword the dragon?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Jillian asked curiously while I nodded back.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What, you’ve never heard of a dragon turning into a sword?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The princess asked somewhat smugly as Jerna approached with wide eyes.</p>
<p>Hwarrrr</p>
<p>As Jerna attempted to touch the sword, it emitted a blinding light.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Master, please don’t let others touch me. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Jerna, Krishna doesn’t allow others to touch it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s not like it’s going to wear down my me touching,”</i></strong> she answered disappointedly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, the path to the next floor is over there. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Following Krishna’s defeat, the entrance had appeared.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Would you like to go?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos had a knowing smile on her face but I ignored her.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Huh, so is this all there is to this sword Krishna? If I were to use it versus an Angel or even a God, could I harm them?’</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Master it is easy to draw blood from an Angel if you use me because we are more or less existences on the same level. If you take into account your strength as well,</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Krishna, are you able to read my thoughts?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Reading master’s thoughts is a matter of course for a tool such as myself. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘From now I even can’t even have any personal space?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Don’t worry Master, I exist only as a tool in your service and would never betray you. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Yeah… but I still require my own privacy. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Privacy, what is that?’</i></strong></p>
<p>As we headed down to the next level I took the time to have a nice chat with Krishna. ’</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Ah… I understand. So when Master tells me to, then I’ll stop reading your mind. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Yes, let’s do it like that. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>Just as we finished our telepathic conversation, we arrived to the next floor where a young looking merchant awaited us. Behind him there was a large temple, much like in the past dungeon.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you the spirit of Killion?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Following my question my party members jumped in surprise, looking at the man’s appearance more closely.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No wonder I thought I recognized him!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, it’s him!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you really Killion’s spirit, one of those Evil Gods?”</i></strong></p>
<p>In answer to their questions the man simply chuckled, but didn’t say a word. He then began drawing something on the ground.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s some sort of hieroglyph. It is a language restricted to the Gods, I’ll try my best to decipher it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The man which we assumed was Killion’s spirit finished writing some symbols on the ground, then placed a small jewelry box down and disappeared.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that the reward for clearing the dungeon?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Princess Mayardus reached forward to grab the box, as Lena shouted towards me urgently.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Quickly stop her Johra! This is a test. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Mayardus, stop!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Unfortunately I was a step too late.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Upon contact the jewelry box opened up and a black mist emerged, swallowing the Princess up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Shit! Jillian, Jerna get back!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“But Master, the box…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We need to save sister!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Get back, that’s an order!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Seeing the two finally retreat I asked Lena.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is Mayardus still alive?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“There’s no way to know as of yet. The glyphs on the floor indicate that if she were to pass the test then she’d survive. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How annoying, we’ve already cleared the dungeon so what kind of reward is this?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stomped angrily on the ground, causing the marble floor to shatter and go flying in every direction. The pieces of marble which came in contact with the black mist however instantly vanished.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Krishna do you know what is going on?’</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Sorry Master, I was only ordered by the God to protect the entrance, that is all.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Which God ordered you?’</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Shiva, the God of Destruction</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Who was the God of Death?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘I recently met with the God of Death, Thanatos, but before that it had been Hera’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Can there be more than one God of Death?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Right, there can indeed be more than one God representing a certain faction, but there will always be a High God which the others will serve. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Then which one is Thanatos? The High God of Death or just a minor God?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘We can’t know as of yet, it is only when they meet the other Gods of Death that the hierarchy is established. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘How troublesome. ’</i></strong></p>
<p>Although I was ecstatic to have a God like Thanatos as a subordinate, I wouldn’t feel the same if she would later be under the control of another higher tiered Death God. Especially with her knowing so many of my secrets.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, I have some hint about how to open the box. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena’s voice appeared like a beacon of hope.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is it Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The glyphs are archaic so my database can’t translate crucial words though. It goes(Those who know… can obtain …. ) Unfortunately that’s all I could decipher. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah! Good job Lena, I can figure out the rest”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What! How can you solve it based on only that much information?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I got it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Those who know a God’s true name, can obtain God’s power. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Just as I finish speaking the box opened and the mist finally dissipated, revealing the Princess, a strange creature and pieces of marble.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sister!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Princess Mayardus!”</i></strong></p>
<p>We ran up to her body which was collapsed on the ground.</p>
<p><strong><i>“She’s just fast asleep. Her vitals are strong, she’ll be fine. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>We all let out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p><strong><i>“But what is that weird looking creature?”</i></strong></p>
<p>From out of the black mist also appeared a weird gray ball which seemed to have a life of its own.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ho ho, I’ve finally awakened! Worship me you mortals, I’m back! Ha ha ha!”</i></strong></p>
<p>On the previously smooth ball, a couple of wrinkles appeared. Shortly after they opened up to reveal a large eye and mouth.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You shut up!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I gave it a strong kick, causing it to go flying across the room and remain embedded into the wall.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What? You dare to kick the God of Whispers! Actually…can you please help me out of here?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ignoring it, I simply left it there in the wall.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey! Don’t leave me like this! Take me out of here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Shut it! I don’t like noisy guys like you the most. In the end we’ve gained nothing useful out of this dungeon. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had been hoping for</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m a God! Also I know a bunch of secrets pertaining the other Gods! Do you know how often Metatron tried to pry those secrets out from me? So if you’d just help me get out of this wall, i could let you in on some highly sensitive information!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I was indeed curious after hearing him speak of Metatron. I decided to draw the teleportation circle and send my party ahead of me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You guys go back first and take good care of the Princess. I have business with that thing. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>They headed back to the dungeon manor, carrying the unconscious Mayardus with them.</p>
<p>I then slowly made my way to the wall the grey ball creature was embedded in and dug it out.</p>
<p>Haha, it was quite troublesome to have been trapped in that box, thanks for getting me out o’ Condemned One. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t need your thanks, so quickly tell me all those secrets you mentioned. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Tong Tong</p>
<p>I instructed him while tapping his eyeball.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m the great God of Whispers! Are you trembling now, Condemned One?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Stop speaking nonsense and start talking”</i></strong></p>
<p>Sheeeh</p>
<p>Krishna’s tip of sword hit it straight on. Although it managed to close its eyelid, it still got burned.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Pff… I’m an God, you could never… what you burned me? How? No, no stop!”</i></strong></p>
<p>One who had never suffered a setback was sure to cringe when first feeling pain, and a God was no exception.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you ready to talk now?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I asked as I held Krishna overhead in a threatening manner.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You think that I’d surrender to you, Condemned One? ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Ziiiiiing</p>
<p>I saw something forming at the center of its eye.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra! It’s charging a spell! It appears to be very similar to the one cast by the Beholder in Jeduth. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I’m on it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I quickly pulled out the same mirror I had used last time.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ahhhhh! How?”</i></strong></p>
<p>In the end his beam was reflected back on him. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ve previously faced off against one who used a similar skill to yours. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Harpok was attacked by his own skill, and couldn’t move.</p>
<p><strong><i>“First I need to put you in your place. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I thrust Krishna in his mouth. ”</p>
<p>Ohhhhhhhh</p>
<p><strong><i>“What was that? I can’t hear you properly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>When I removed Krishna from the inside of its mouth were burning and smoke emerged. The veins on its eye seemed to be popping and it was clear that it was in a lot of pain.</p>
<p>Ohhhhh Sa….. Ohhh</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 114</p>
<p>I left the burning blade inside its mouth for quite some time, before finally pulling Krishna out.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So, are you feeling a bit more humble now?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ask me anything… I’ll answer. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I can’t feel that you are being earnest. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stick my sword back into Harpok’s mouth.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Stop… just hold up one moment! I promise I’ve become more humble, give me a chance!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… I just have trouble believing you, why is that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, no, truly ask me anything and I’ll answer you to the fullest of my abilities. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok, I’ll believe you for now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I look down at Harpok with Krishna resting on my shoulder.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you a God?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s right, I’m a God. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then have you heard of Metatron?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course I know him, he’s the one who imprisoned me in this jewelry box. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I level my gazed at him and waited a moment before continuing.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is your relationship with Metatron?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He had some secrets which he wanted to pry out of me, so he kept torturing me to such an end. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Torture? How can that have gone one for any significant amount of time? You fold far too easily to pain. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s because something is special about your sword. Normal weapons aren’t capable of harming Gods. That thing must be an Artifact class weapon”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it? I have no idea, so then it’s possible to harm a God with these so called Artifact weapons?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, in fact it was the very reason that Metatron had been pressing me for answers. He wanted an Artifact weapon of his own. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh so it’s something that can even harm a God, that’s good to know. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Master, have you finally recognize my value?’</i></strong></p>
<p>‘Right, it appears that you will be quite useful indeed. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, even if it’s an Artifact then it can only harm minor Gods. It wouldn’t be able to even scratch those High Gods, not to mention anyone those God Kings. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“ God Kings?</p>
<p><strong><i>“For example, Skyfather and Metatron who were both on about the same level. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Oh, then why was it that Metatron was so interested in getting his hands on an Artifact?</p>
<p>He couldn’t possibly be so concerned with killing some minor Gods right?”</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, it’s just that Metatron’s ability is to slow down time and enhance certain attributes. If an Artifact were to be enhanced, then it’s possible that it could be used to harm even the High Gods. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Hmm… slowing down time was his ability after all, I wonder how I can even counter that?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So, did you resist his torture and not tell him how to acquire an Artifact weapon?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I ended up caving and told him that to acquire an Artifact would require the sacrifice of a God, but I knew that he would fail. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see… so you lied to him and led him into a trap. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… I guess so, it was a small sacrifice for the peace of the entire world. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Should I stick Krishan back into you? Are you lying to me right now as</p>
<p><strong><i>“To you? No, no I would never, anything but that burning sword!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You were scared of him which is why you talked, well at least he didn’t succeed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… all’s well that ends well, right?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It could see it’s eyeball swirling from side to side, it was obviously trying to come up with some excuse and appeared nervous just like a human might.</p>
<p><strong><i>“So the reason you’re locked up was that Metatron failed and took his anger out on you?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, actually after Metatron failed he came back to me and asked me what the proper way was.. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… then how did you answer him?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well… for the sake of peace in this world, I sent him elsewhere. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“To another universe?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, a parallel universe. I told him that in there he could increase the strength of an Artifact by absorbing the life essences of countless insignificant beings. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, how many is countless?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I asked with a large frown.</p>
<p><strong><i>“The magic required to enhance such a weapon would certainly require the sacrifice of billions of lives. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So in order to save the lives of those in this universe, you sent him to reap the lives of billions in this parallel universe, right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, something like that. What happens in another universe isn’t of my concern so it seemed like a good option. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I gnashed my teeth in anger.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, then how do you think someone from that other universe would react if he heard such a story?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I couldn’t possibly fathom how a mortal thinks. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then what if that mortal felt like thrusting his sword in your mouth at this very moment?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wa… surely you aren’t from that universe. Truly this was never my intention…. No, Woobwwob”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stabbed Krishna deeply into him.</p>
<p><strong><i>‘Should I kill this piece of shit?’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>‘Master I’d suggest you put this guy to good use instead of simply killing it. ’</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra it would be far more beneficial to squeeze out all its knowledge rather than simply killing it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Krishna and Lena both advocated for me to stay my hand, but I wasn’t yet ready.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Because of you, all life on Earth is now dead! Countless of beings across the universe have been sacrificed! What right do you have to continue living?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I kept my burning sword in him for quite some time, until his chin was lopped off and his tongue and inner mouth had completely liquified and spattered on the ground.</p>
<p>Shhhhh Shhhh</p>
<p>Harpok still wasn’t dead though. A God’s vitality was truly incredible, and it’s entire mouth was regenerating at a speed visible to the eye.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra you’ve chosen wisely. Simply killing it wouldn’t have been the right choice. After extracting all the information it has, it won’t be too late to then kill it in the most painful and brutal way possible. It should be subject to 100 times the suffering which those from our world suffered. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena was burning with fury at this latest enemy. Perhaps it was the will of her human creators which had seeped</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thanatos are you there?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you call, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos arrived and prostrated herself at my feet.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m giving you permission to torture this thing in the most brutal way possible. I’ll lend you Krishna, so be sure to extract everything it knows and then report back to me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’ll be done as you say, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After borrowing Krishna from me, she grabbed hold of Harpok and with a wicked smile, vanished into thin air.</p>
<p>“Johra, that being which used to be Melpomene is an unknown existence. Even the materials which make up her body are unknown and don’t exist in this world.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, well it would be strange if death itself could be categorized as a material. Sigh…I am exhausted, I’ll be heading back. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>My heart was heavy after finally learning the reason behind the extermination of all life on Earth from Harpok. No, it wasn’t only Earth, since Metatron must have likewise targeted countless planets. The thought of so many lives being extinguished simply so that one being could enhance his personal strength was sickening.</p>
<p>Upon returning the my dungeon manor I first checked up on the Princess’ condition, before going to our bedroom to meet Viezda.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You’re back Johra. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, but it’s been a long day. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, what’s happened?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I finally learned the reason behind a tragedy which has occurred in my past. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I collapsed on our new bed, completely exhausted. Viezda came up and snuggled up to me, while stroking my head in an attempt to comfort me.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure what has happened, but since it’s already in the past then there isn’t much you can do about it now.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I suppose you’re right. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it possible to prevent that same tragedy from occurring in the future?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I don’t know, possibly. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“If you can’t do it, Johra, then no one can. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you truly think so?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“It isn’t only a question of ability. You are always going out and try your best to do the right thing. I don’t think you need to worry about things which have yet to occur.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… even though it is something which concerns the lives of countless beings?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The fault lies at the feet of the evil people who are the ones that are doing the killing. You can’t blame yourself for every wrong ever committed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that so? But I feel like that is just taking the easy way out…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, but you can’t right every wrong, so don’t beat yourself up over it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing Viezda’s comment I suddenly remembered a conversation which was buried deep in my memory.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, I had made some promise, and something about some trial which would be unavoidable…just what was it already?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra you sound tired, why don’t you go to sleep?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah… that sounds like a great idea. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>As I tried hard to remember, my body succumbed to fatigue and I fell into a deep sleep where I once again met that</p>
<p><strong><i>“I remember. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you though?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, are you a ****”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Similar, I suppose, but still different. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Different? In what way?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s all I’ll say for now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I have a faint recollection of a promise. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Indeed, when the time comes you’ll know. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“By the way why are we meeting in my dreams? I feel like I’ve known you for quite some time. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“This conversation isn’t our first, nor will it be our last. You will undoubtedly forget, but I’ll repeat it once more. I’ve opened the path to the destruction of all worlds in order to keep the promise between us. Present, Past and Future are all rushing towards the same continuum and the destruction is beginning to accelerate, you’d best hurry. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What is that about, I still can’t entirely remember my promise. What if I don’t hold up my end? Will the entire universe be destroyed?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Leave it at that for now. The flow of destiny is like a bubble underwater. It is hidden from sight, but as it grows larger and larger it will eventually rise to the surface and vanish. I am the embodiment of our Promise, Destiny, if you would. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What are you talking about? I can’t understand it at all. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Goodbye, and until next time. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hey, Stop! At least let me know when we next meet!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I woke up and realized I was simply talking to myself. Viezda and Vez were sleeping beside me, while the moonlight controlled by Lena filtered into our room.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena did you record all that?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, just as you instructed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Great, I’ll go watch it in the lab. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I headed underground to watch the video of my muttering to myself in my sleep. I was hoping to gain some understanding as to who I was speaking with and what it was about, but….</p>
<p><strong><i>“What! Why is it that the audio is cut off everytime I speak his name? Can the file be restored?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s strange, I’ve even tried restoring the sound by using the vibrations in your jaw bones but isn’t possible for some odd reason. I will investigate my own algorithm. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>It felt like a conspiracy that all the important audio was cut off and that even Lena wasn’t capable of restoring it.</p>
<p>“Could it my some kind of magical interference? No, that shouldn’t be possible since I personally placed several layers of magical protection spells which Lena had come up with.</p>
<p>But if it isn’t magic then just what could have caused this?”</p>
<p>My intrigue towards the contents of my dream grew even larger. Not matter how hard I tried to remember what it was I dreamt about, nothing stuck.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Could it be some huge secret which if it were to be known could cause the immediate destruction of the universe?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I tried pouring over the recordings for anything which might jump out at me, but saw nothing of interest.</p>
<p>“Could it be that it wasn’t a regular dream… but then</p>
<p>I watched the same recording over and over again, but learned nothing new. Likewise Lena was incredible frustrated.</p>
<p>“Johra I’ve run a scan of my algorithm and everything seems fine. I don’t seem to have any corrupt data, so I have no idea what could possibly cause the audio file to fail. According to Ockham’s Razor, it might be background noise, but that just doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>“Lena, continue to analyse the footage. For some reason I feel that you’ve touched on an important point, but can’t quite put my finger on it.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Sir!”</i></strong></p>
<p>The next day I once again set out with my party, as we prepped for the last two dungeons.</p>
<p>The Parli and Baror dungeons were located in the New Continent. These largely undiscovered lands didn’t have any established means of transportation so I ordered Lena to create a submarine. The reason was that I didn’t want others to see us travelling on a modern boat, so a submarine would be stealthier.</p>
<p>“Johra it should be easy enough to assemble it, just carry these pieces over.</p>
<p>Lena had prepared and the parts for the submarine in 1000 different wooden boxes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hm… that’s a lot of work. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“After arriving to the beach I teleported the boxes over and it took 10 days time to finish assembling it.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra I’ve named this aircraft, the Nautilus. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wait, wasn’t it supposed to be a submarine?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well it could function as a sub, but it could also fly in the air or even into space if needed. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You’ve definitely gone overboard again, no wonder it was so hard to assemble!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It might prove useful someday. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Nautilus was a relatively small submarine, being 20 meters long and 4 meters high. It was a total of 300 tons and could navigate under in any condition.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is that in front?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That is a mini version of the Tri-force laser cannon we installed on Valen. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s a bit too much, were you planning on blowing up a star, Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, you know what they say, better to ask for forgiveness that permission. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I naturally used it as its intended submarine function in order to cross the sea. It had its own autopilot function so I could enjoy the scenery of the deep sea. Unlike on Earth these waters were teeming with aquatic life.</p>
<p>Along our ride there was even a 40 meter long Ichthyosaurus and a giant looking Octopus which which appeared like one of those mythological Krakens which considered the Nautilus as prey and tried to attack. Suffice it to say that things did not end too well for them.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra the entire sea has been mapped out. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh?Was this the reason we’ve been moving so slowly?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s like killing two birds with one stone, the map might prove useful. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Lena, in the future please focus only on the tasks you’ve been assigned. You sometimes go overboard which results in large inefficiencies.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay!”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 115</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow, what a gorgeous beach, the white sand is so fine. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stepped off the Nautilus and onto the shores of the New Continent.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, keep the Nautilus hidden and safe. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Got it, I’ll keep it on patrol mode along the coast. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The fauna in this area was unlike anything from our continent. There were colorful birds flying among palm trees.</p>
<p>“It’s an environment similar to that of Rio Negro. It is also a tropical climate and it is teeming with wildlife.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s pretty amazing, but I hate insects. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Walking into the rainforest I tried to ignore the countless bugs which swarmed me.</p>
<p>The strong sun rays were for the most part blocked by the heavy foliage, but due to us being near the coast, the humidity was unbearable and I almost suffered from a heat stroke.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn, what’s going on? Why is it so hot all over here?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra a regular human would have already succumbed to a heat stroke and died, I think it’s best to take a break. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Guess I have no choice. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I set up a teleportation circle beside a large tree and returned to my dungeon manor.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, it’s like arriving in heaven. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The surrounded in the cool dungeon air I couldn’t help but cry out in relief.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, you’ve returned. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra you came back!”</i></strong></p>
<p>In the bathhouse they had specially prepared a cold bath filled with ice cubes.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Great, thanks!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Without hesitation I jumped right in, cooling off my body.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Sigh, I need to do more exercise, I’m getting lazy. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>My destination the Pali dungeon was still 5 days away from the beach. That was still ten times the distance which I had travelled earlier today.</p>
<p>After bringing my body temperature back to normal and regaining my condition, I returned to the rainforest.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, set the course. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Understood, I’ll project the map to your cornea. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I kept forging ahead towards the Pali dungeon with Lena’s guidance.</p>
<p>Booooot Qauac</p>
<p>It happened instantaneously, a creature broke out from the ground and stung my foot.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What the hell, where did that come from?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>[You’ve been afflicted with the curse, Apollo’s venom]</i></strong></p>
<p>I</p>
<p><strong><i>“How odd, I wasn’t even able to detect it with my sensors and prepare the Rohim shield intime. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s no big deal Lena, just a small bite, but what is this Apollo’s venom?”</i></strong></p>
<p>That little scorpion had even been able to break through my defenses which can even stand up to a Dragon’s attack, not to mention that it evaded Lena’s detection. I was really curious about the scorpion and was eager to experiment on it, but unfortunately I had already destroyed it.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra it seems that the poison on your foot is quite serious. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What?”</i></strong></p>
<p>The color of my foot was turning green.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Shit!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I quickly set up a transition array, intent on heading back to the dungeon but it didn’t work.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s going on, why isn’t it working, is it my magic? Material Creation! Material Creation! Why isn’t any of my magic working, is it due to the poison? Curse of Apollo? Shit this is the work of a God!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh my dear master, even your cries of fury are beautiful. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos appeared beside me and looked at me with a grim smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Uhm… Thanatos don’t just stand there, do something about this!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry, but I’ve arrived too late. It looks like you’ll have no choice but to die now. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>She placed her hand on my chest and stilled my heart.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huuuuh what are you doing… Thanatos…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You know that my only ability is in killing, I don’t know how to save you other than my killing what is harming you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt Thanatos’ deadly will invade my every bloodvessel, cleansing out the poison. Eventually I couldn’t hold on any longer and passed out due to the pain.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ahh Ahh Am I not dead then?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, fortunately not, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That damn Sun God, Apollo. Was the scorpion sent by him?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m sorry Johra, in the future I will be sure to have the Rohim shield active at all times. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing her apology I couldn’t help but snort coldly.</p>
<p>“Then</p>
<p><strong><i>“Then I will return to torture Harpok. Call me if you require my assistance, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>After Thanatos vanished the sunlight invaded my eyes and I had to cover them with my hands. I lay down on the ground for half a day, unable to stand up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn, although the poison was removed, I’m still unable to use any magic. Could it be that the curse is still in effect?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had tried to cast all of my skills but none worked.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, help me draw the array well. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I created a perfect teleportation circle with Lena’s aid, but wasn’t able to get it to activate.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess I’ll return to the Nautilus, can you mark me the quickest route. I’ll also need to get drink and soon or else I might really die here. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I had become far less arrogant. Luckily it wasn’t too difficult for me to hunt my own food considering my high attack power and Rohim Shield. Also with Lena’s help I could easily find water and avoid getting lost, but the fact that my magic was neutralized meant that I was severely handicapped.</p>
<p><strong><i>“A God has directly interfere with me, I thought that they weren’t able to do that?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I couldn’t help but grumble at my complete lack of information. As I arrived back to the beach and onto the Nautilus, I immediately collapsed in bed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, so nice to have some regular temperature once again. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Nautilus was fully equipped with food and drink and a comfortable place to sleep. It was the perfect place to regain my strength.</p>
<p>I had no idea how long I slept, but by the time I had awakened, we were submerged 10,000 meters below sea level.</p>
<p><strong><i>“How long have I slept, Lena?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“About 19 hours. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hoo Did you communicate with the dungeon manor? ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“I informed them about this situation, but for now there is no way to teleport back to the dungeon manor. Also there is no way for those inside to get out because there isn’t a real exit.</p>
<p>If not for the Teleportation array, our dungeon house and this world</p>
<p><strong><i>“So if I can’t resolve this curse I can’t return?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“In theory, yes. Although it might be possible to complete the array with magic stones, it would be incredibly unstable and the results unpredictable. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“And in the case of failure?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It is unknown what would happen since magic stones aren’t very stable. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Hearing Lena’s explanation, I couldn’t help but despair. All my friends and family, along with all my preparations I had done in these last few years were located in my dungeon manor.</p>
<p>Now I was restricted to hiding in the deep sea, helpless.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena where are we going?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“To the deepest valley of the ocean floor. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Because Johra is in a weakened and vulnerable state and it should be a safe place to hide out. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So I’m just a weakling now that I can’t use magic…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Frustrated, I reached into a small pocket and fished out the God necklace I already carried around with me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This might be the only solution to my problems… no, not like this. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I stopped to think for a little while before calling her out.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thanatos. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>She instantly appeared before me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you call for me, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Unlike her sweet words, her voice was somber and a bit creepy.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Thanatos can you release me from this curse?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sorry that isn’t within my capabilities. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then can you teleport me to my dungeon manor?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That is likewise something I can’t do. My only abilities are to kill and follow Master around. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Then what’s the point of you being a God?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, it might be to bring death to everyone other than you. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is there no other way that you could help me?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I can make you die temporarily. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Temporary death? Like somehow dying but still surviving?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos let out a hearty laugh.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, it would be a near death experience (NDE) You would effectively be dead for a very short period of time, but later come back to life. Of course if I were to make a small mistake then you’d die for real. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You’re quite dangerous. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“There’s no way you’d think that I’d let me dear master</p>
<p>Thanatos’ evil smile didn’t really inspire me with confidence.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Maybe we will try that out as a last resort. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, I’ll go back to torturing then. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How long do you think you’ll have left?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“It seems to be having some effect. I’ve given him a few NDE now and he seems a bit dizzy as a result of it. But don’t worry I’m being careful not to kill him.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That sounds quite horrible, wait, Gods can also die?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I am not sure yet, but the NDE worked. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos’ creepy smile returned as she recalled all the torture she had unleashed upon Harpok.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, when you get some concrete information, let me know. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes Master, I’ll go take good care of our friend Harpok”</i></strong></p>
<p>She instantly vanished, leaving me alone with Lena in this submarine.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmmm what should I do?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I struggled to decide whether I should put on the necklace and chance it. It was quite the difficult choice, especially having seen first hand how challenging some of its curses were to overcome.</p>
<p>“Damn, I can’t seem to find a solution.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra, I encourage you to rest and think on this with a fresh mind. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You’re right, who knows maybe this curse will dissipate over time. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>I spent the next three months on the ocean floor. I often checked on the status of the curse, but was worried to learn that it never changed.</p>
<p>Finally one morning Thanatos was sitting on top of me as I woke up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“OMG! I thought I had a nightmare!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Haha”</i></strong></p>
<p>If you were to have nightmare with the God of Death, I can assure you that it would be an unforgettable experience. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn, stop playing around again would you!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why? I like to touch master’s body. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“We need wait for the right time. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m ready for you, any time any place…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Fine, what did you come here for, Thanatos?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Harpok’s torture has finally ended. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really? What have you learned from him? How is he?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I think I might have accidentally killed him. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You what?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… he was kind of dead, but later he revived ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What? Tell me everything. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 116</p>
<p>I was giving him the usual near death experience, when suddenly he threw himself at Krishna, choosing death. I tried to pull back the sword, but it all happened too fast and I was too late. ”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh… so Harpok chose to die. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Perhaps, I’m not so convinced that he actually died though. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“He’s still alive? How do you know?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It seems to be one of his abilities, we can see his other life through his eye. I brought his body over. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos presented Harpok’s corpse with a grievous wound to its side; however his eye shown like a bright crystal, projecting his new life which was like watching a movie.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that Earth? It seems a bit similar to what it would look like in the future. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“According to the scene, It looks like a depiction of Earth right before the cataclysm. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right? Are they the parents, did Harpok reincarnate into a baby? Please take a look and figure out where it is Harpok escaped to. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Got it!”</i></strong></p>
<p>I order Lena to research the scene captured on his eyeball.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Who were you talking to, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos asked questioningly.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, I was giving Lena the image to analyse. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, you mean those automated magical maids? Wasn’t she supposed to be back in the dungeon manor? Can she also exist in the water? I feel a bunch of aquatic life all around me. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you truly able to sense life, Thanatos?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Naturally, I feed off death so the ability to sense life is a must”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that all we are to you, prey?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I felt a bit uncomfortable being next to Thanatos since her recent transformation, especially that creepy smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“You have nothing to worry about, Master. When your time comes I’ll make sure you have a beautiful death. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Uhm… actually I plan on living a long and healthy life. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s fine, I’ll be waiting. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right… so did you get any information out of Harpok?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m not sure how important the information I got was. He’s been feeding me so much nonsense for so long that it became hard to distinguish. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, so what did you learn?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Well the most important bits are probably those about your Fallen class, Artifacts, the background of your</p>
<p><strong><i>“They all sound pretty juicy, let’s start with the necklace. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Heehee, I expected you’d be interested in that part. He seemed to know quite a lot as he was knowledgeable regarding items. What should I start with, the story behind the necklace, the rules regarding its curses, or the stories of the Gods which managed to achieve Godhood with its help. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Start with the necklace’s background. Learning its origins should help us better understand it. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos’ lips curled into a smile.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s identity is actually that of a God which was a follower of Metatron. He was then transformed into that necklace. His name was Maitreiya , God of Ascendance and was in fact Metatron’s twin brother. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What? He turned his own brother into such a thing?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Did Gods even treat their own families like tools? It was quite awkward to know that the necklace I was carrying around with me this whole time was in fact a powerful God.</p>
<p>“Yes, although he was Metatron’s brother, it is said that he betrayed and was spying for the High Gods. For this reason he was turned in to this necklace and could only be released after having 100 individuals turn to Gods through the neckalce’s power.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow, then how many have there been so far?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“As far as Harpok was aware there have been 66 so far. They were all Metatrons followers, but some have already fallen. Right now there are only the remaining four, but they’ve all been sealed in dungeons. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, so it’s confirmed that they are in the four legendary dungeons?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, according to Harpok the four dungeons were created to prevent the destruction of the world and promote the evolution of life. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I think Jeduth had told me something similar. That the dungeons were desinged by the High Gods to imprison some dangerous monsters. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, something like that, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos gave me a smile, making the situation a bit awkward. Her smile on such a pale face was more than a it creepy.</p>
<p>“It’s good that our information lines up,</p>
<p>I quickly tried to change the mood.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Have you heard about Divine Grace”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I think I remember something about that. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… I don’t know much about it myself but I’ll try to explain what I’ve understood from Harpok. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Divine Grace is formed as a result of interactions between living beings. Magic is comes from the elements, but Black magic depends on Divine Grace.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… so it’s connected to all living creatures. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Divine Grace also determines the direction which a certain race might evolve and how much they can level up. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, well I had guessed that much based on my own experiences. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Divine Grace is also the single greatest power a God can harness and wield. In order to collect that Divine Grace, the sacrifice of Life around the universe. And so, began one of the greatest wars in history as the Gods created factions and fought over the available Divine Grace. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hm… its seems the I will also need to fight for my slice of the power. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“That great war lasted for a very, very long time, until finally two major powers brought it to an end. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Metatron and Skyfather?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“You know those two?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well one I actually crossed path with and the other I’ve heard about in passing. Anyways, please continue your explanation. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, so Metatron wanted to completely regulated all aspects of life so as to be in full control of this power; whereas Skyfather wanted to let sentient beings like humans breed freely, so as…. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wait, did you say breed?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yup, from a God’s perspective, mortals are just livestock bred for the purpose of creating Divine Grace. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wha…what arrogance!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it though? Anyway, as you well known that war ended when Metatron’s faction was defeated and he was chased out into a different dimension. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“So we’ve learned quite a lot. It seems that this Divine Grace is at the root of a bunch of things like experience, evolutions and even the power of the Gods. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, and this necklace plays the role of amplifying Divine Grace. Most living creatures can only absorb a limited amount of Divine Grace, but once you wear this necklace that cap</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is it basically acts as an amplifier for Divine Grace?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Yes, but before receiving that power, you are first cursed. The type of curse and how much Divine Grace can be obtained differs from person to person.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s why you became a God of Death”</i></strong></p>
<p>“In my case it was based on the numerous deaths and revivals, which was only possible due to Master’s help. According to Harpok it is quite rare for one to retain their personality after ascending to Godhood. He mentioned that a God’s power must have interfere during my ascension that allowed me to remain relatively unchanged.</p>
<p><strong><i>“A power similar to a God…”</i></strong></p>
<p>I recalled the Resurrection Song which I had cast at the very end and had mixed in with that dark power which helped her ascend to Godhood. If that had not been the case perhaps Thanatos would have killed me immediately upon awakening.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you have any idea why that is, Master?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Uhm, not for the moment, why don’t you continue your story?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well that seems to be all Harpok knew about the necklace. Even after torturing him to the very limit he couldn’t reveal anything more. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see, well it has already been very insightful. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, there’s also that bit about the politics between the High Gods. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, anything related to Metatron and Skyfather?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, at the moment they are the two which stand at the very top of the divine hierarchy but they have been absent for quite some time. Still, Skyfather is considered to reign supreme, but there are other smaller factions of High Gods which don’t recognize his authority. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, like which?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The most prominent group which calls itself Gnossian. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Gnossian? That rings a bell… did you find out anything about them?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It definitely reminded me of the supreme sage Gnoss, but I didn’t want to say his name, for obvious reasons.</p>
<p>“It’s a very secretive order, so even among the God’s which had joined, they might not necessarily know the identities of there fellow members. Harpok was part of their group, but even after a lot of torture the only identity he seemed to know was Gaia.</p>
<p>“Gaia?</p>
<p><strong><i>“Gaia? Goddess of Nature Gaia?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I guess that’s the one. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Gaia huh… it’s not the first time I’ve come across that name. I guess that’s just one more reason to meet up. Do you know where I could find her?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos shook her head.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Harpok committed suicide before I could ask. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, that’s too bad. It was important to know that. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m sorry Master, I didn’t expect his actions. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Tanatos looked frustrated at her failure, it was quite the funny expression to see on a God of Death, so I couldn’t help but sneak in a laugh.</p>
<p><strong><i>“No, it wasn’t your fault. By the way, where is Krishna?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, I left it behind. I’ll go fetch it right away. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wait, since you were able to carry Harpok with you, could you carry me as well?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well since the path I tread is that of Death, you wouldn’t survive the transition. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… so that is how you get around. It’s too bad I was hoping you could bring me back to the dungeon manor – Sigh. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>Seeing me look all depressed, Thanatos added.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll go get Krishna at once, Master. ”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>She vanished into thin air.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… I forgot to ask her some more questions about that land of death she travels through. I guess it’ll have to wait until next time I see her. ”</i></strong></p>
<p>The Nautilus was quite quiet, only the sound of static was heard.</p>
<p>With nothing to do I looked into Harpok’s eyes.</p>
<p>It was showing the life of a happy family. A lovely mother and caring father. A great environment for a child to grow up happily and enjoy a promising future. I silently watched it play out until Lena reported to me about two hours later.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s an incredible coincidence. That video is 99% identical to what Gnoss’ house was on Earth. I compared it to the records that we had about all management related to Gamma…”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… so Gnoss is involved here too? Wait… Damn it!”</i></strong></p>
<p>The voice which I had gone so long without having to listen to finally reappeared.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Did you call for me, Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh!”</i></strong></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 117</p>
<p><strong><i>“How are you… wait, where is this place? Harpok’s body is here too? What’s going on Johra? Last I remember we were attacking the Rohim’s home planet. How long has it been since then?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ugh… you just got back and are already so annoying, shut up.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Who are you talking to? Where did that gem come from?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Lena, I’ll need a moment to have an uninterrupted chat with my friend here, could you make sure all our countermeasure are up so no one can spy on us.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Got it!”</i></strong></p>
<p>We hadn’t spoken to each other in quite some time but I had instinctively told him to shut up. It made beginning our conversation a bit awkward.</p>
<p>Finally Lena’s eavesdropping countermeasure were up and we could start.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Hoo I tried very hard not to think about you, but it seems that in the end I slipped up.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why? Surely our relationship was much better towards the end no?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, you should have told me how powerful Metatron was.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How could I tell you, you were ignoring anything I said.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Sigh</p>
<p>Knowing now that Gnoss was actually a reincarnation of Harpok complicated our relationship somewhat.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s okay, I know undeads like you don’t have emotions, after all I’ve observed you for quite some time…wait, why do you feel different? Leader of the Fallen, what’s that? It isn’t even a race or profession, a unique class? Ha ha ha~ you really do surprise me every time!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“What do you know, the real surprise hasn’t even arrived.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, and even bigger surprise? Please, do tell, I’m so curious!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you know about Harpok?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“He’s the God which stands even above the supreme sages. He’s the God of Whispers and Secrets.</p>
<p>“What, there was a God which the supreme sages served?</p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, most of what I know, I do because of Harpok.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I see….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, to become a supreme sage you need to be compatible with Harpok’s Divine Grace. The former supreme sage who mentored me said that I was a great match with Harpok.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, no kidding since you basically are Harpok.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ha ha, my mentor would also say that I resemble Harpok quite a lot.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“No, I’m not saying you’re like him, I’m telling</p>
<p><strong><i>“Wait what? I’m Harpok?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Right, Harpok once reincarnated on Earth and that was your past life.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wha…what are you talking about.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Look, Harpok’s body is here, but not his spirit. He’s already reincarnated.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What? Why would he abandon his body?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I was torturing him for information and he couldn’t take the pain I suppose, so he committed suicide. After that, through his eye I could see that he had reincarnated and that he was living back on Earth. Living your childhood.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How shocking… I mean it’s hard to believe, even for me who has access to such much knowledge.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Here, I have your dead body. Although you can’t see it, you should be able to feel something, right?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes… I can still vaguely feel Harpok’s presence since he died a short time ago. By the way how did Harpok even die, a God’s body is supposed to be immortal.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“For minor Gods it is possible to kill them with an Artifact class weapon.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Do you truly have an artifact weapon?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Why do you ask?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well if this truly is a God’s body then I actually have some hope of resurrecting.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, how so?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“As you know I’ve long been banished and we can only communicate due to the binding contract we had made. However, if I were to come in contact with a God’s corpse, I believe I can take possession of it. Sigh… is this fate?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hmm… I see.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Could you touch Harpok’s corpse, Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p>I almost did what he asked out of reflex, before stopping to think. This was an opportunity, he couldn’t resurrect without my help.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Before I do so, let’s make a contract, Gnoss.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Contract? Do we really need more of those between us?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course, I still can’t 100% trust you so I need this as an insurance.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ok, what do I need to do.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I only require you to fulfill one condition.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Just the one? Is the reason there is only one because it’s a very stringent condition? Ok… just tell me already, I don’t have much of a choice.”</i></strong></p>
<p>The more he spoke the weaker he sounded. He knew that I had a confrontational personality that wouldn’t back down, so he tried</p>
<p><strong><i>“I ask only that you be a true friend, and use all of your knowledge for my sake.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hm…a simple enough condition, but it’s actually quite deep. Still, my answer is yes.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Great, thank you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Aren’t you wondering why I said yes?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I know you will tell me first.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“The reason Harpok chose death rather than spilling his secrets is that he didn’t trust you. I know you Johra, and ever since you’ve kept that promise of getting revenge on the Rohim, I’ve decided to follow you to the very end. Now, when I get in contact with the God’s corpse I’ll be free of any restrictions and….”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Are you sure you’re not trying to trick me somehow?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I promise you’ll get the full story after I take over that body.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that a promise?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, I swear it on my very soul.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good.”</i></strong></p>
<p>I brought the gem which Gnoss resided in and placed it on Harpok’s corpse. Upon contact it immediately absorbed the jewel and I stepped back to observe.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Uh… so is it reviving?”</i></strong></p>
<p>It took about half an hour, but his body regenerated all injuries and he opened his eye.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Is that you Gnoss?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“No, I’m Harpok again, but I now have Gnoss’ memories. Polymorph!”</i></strong></p>
<p>He transformed in to Gnoss’ human form.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… it feels so comfortable in here. Could it be because all those memories which match up perfectly with this body?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Gnoss muttered to himself as he touched his body everywhere.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What you’re doing is a bit weird, put some clothes on Gnoss, I mean Harpok.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh right, Polymorph!”</i></strong></p>
<p>He turned into the middle aged scientist which had contributed so much to the creation of Gamma.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Huh? Creator? Why are you here?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Lena piped up and broke the silence.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah… well basically it’s Harpok which has come back to life.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well even if you’re a bit different, you look the same. I didn’t think that I’d be seeing you again!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ha ha ha ~ Lena! How did you come over to this world? With Johra?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It seems it was because Lena had planted some nanobots on my person.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“What? No one’s thought about this before, crossing over in such a</p>
<p><strong><i>“Of course,”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Absolutely! Take a look at this ship, it’s named Nautilus but it can also fly and even go into space!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Wow, incredible!”</i></strong></p>
<p>This childish AI and its creator spent the next few hours chatting away and catching up.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Master, I’m back. Here’s Krishna… what’s going on? Wasn’t he dead?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Thanatos returned to a living Harpok, so she was confused.</p>
<p><strong><i>“It’s a bit complicated, but basically he’s come back to life.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh… then can I torture it some more?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah! Please, please don’t torture me anymore. We are on the same side now.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Harpok knelt down at Thanatos’ feet, pleading for his life.</p>
<p>It seems that his time spent with her had been quite traumatic and left quite the scar.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Harpok, do you have a way to solve my current curse?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It should be possible, Lena can you help me set up a three dimensional hologram?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Sure father!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Father?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Well, it was part of her programming to refer to me as father.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay”</i></strong></p>
<p>Along with Thanatos, we watched Harpok and Lena hard at work. Finally after five hours the three dimensional spell was completed.</p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s amazing, a magic array hanging in mid air.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Creating a 3D array is truly quite taxing, it was only possible due to Lena’s aid. Come over here.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I….see.”</i></strong></p>
<p>As I walked into the middle of the array, Harpok began casting a magic spell.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Can this be dealt with just a single spell?”</i></strong></p>
<p>Harpok nodded back and began chanting; however since it was to deal with a God’s curse, it was quite the long and complicated chant.</p>
<p>Zzzing</p>
<p>Finally, my curse was lifted.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Marterial Creation: Iron”</i></strong></p>
<p>A piece of high quality Iron appeared in my hand.</p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m glad you’re back.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Johra did you have that legendary necklace?”</i></strong></p>
<p>“How did you know?’</p>
<p>Well I do have Harpok’s memories, so it’s easy to guess based on the questions Thanatos was asking in our torture sessions.”</p>
<p><strong><i>“Ah, right.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I should be able to help you out. Wear the necklace and I can reset the conditions until you find one that you like.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, don’t forget that I’m the God of Whispers and Secrets”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“How convenient.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Of course, why do you think that Metatron was trying so hard to pry that</p>
<p>I quickly put on the necklace.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What’s the condition?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It says I need to poison 10,000,000 people.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Hoo, that’s a bit much. Lena, let’s create the array I showed you earlier.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes father!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Zzzing</p>
<p>They created another 3D magic array and I entered inside.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Now you just need to wait a while.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After about an hour my condition was reset.</p>
<p><strong><i>“What is it this time?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Something crazy… I need to kill 100 million people with the use of magic.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Damn, another ridiculous one.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Again!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Shit, again!”</i></strong></p>
<p>After two months of resetting I finally found one which was doable.</p>
<p><strong><i>“This one should be fine.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Oh, what is it?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I need to make a planet which has a diameter of at least 1,000 kilometers.”</i></strong></p>
<p>“Oh, that’s not bad. No one even has to die. Lena, scan the star system for a suitable location.</p>
<p>“I’ve already finished calculating and here are the results. If you use your Material Creation to power the Nautilus, we can arrive to the closest spot in 2 years time.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Material Creation: Iron”</p>
<p><strong><i>“That’s enough for today, Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Good job, Johra.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’m indeed pretty tired tired.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“I’ll open up a direct line with the dungeon manor, it seems they all miss you.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Okay, do it.”</i></strong></p>
<p>After a short time Vez’s hologram appeared before me.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Dad!”</i></strong></p>
<p>Her hologram tried to hug me but passed right through. She had grown so fast and looked like a budding 15 year old girl. Seeing my charming baby girl helped relieve me of all the fatigue I had been enduring.</p>
<p><strong><i>“How are you doing, Vez?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Come back to the house, I want to see you!”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yeah, I know baby but I can’t go back right now, it might take a while.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Gnoss had explained to me that it would be dangerous to use the teleportation array while in transit. Once we had arrived on the planet then would be able to set up the array and return.</p>
<p><strong><i>“Everyone misses you…. Big sis Mayardus, sister Jerna and brother Jillian. Mother is lonely everyday, come home soon, dad.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“It won’t be long now, just six more months.”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Really dad?”</i></strong></p>
<p><strong><i>“Yes, not a day more, I promise.”</i></strong></p>
<p>Exhausted after having experienced such a loaded day, I fell asleep while travelling through the deep and empty space.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 118</p>
<p>I didn't actually have any idea how to begin creating my very own 1000 km planet.</p>
<p>Naturally I knew a certain amount of math behind it. A planet with a diameter of 1000 km resulted in a volume of (1000*1000*1000*4*?/3) = 4,188,789,330 km3 .</p>
<p>The density of iron was 8. 37g/cm3, so one cubic meter would be 8. 37 tons. One cubic kilometer would then be 8. 370,000,000 tons, or about 8. 3 billion tons. If we were to take that number and multiply it by the planets volume which was 4,188,789,330, it would result in more or less 3. 23 *1016 tons, which according to Lena was a very very big number indeed.</p>
<p>The reason we based our calculations on iron is that in fact most planets were formed from material which is even denser than iron, so it was used to calculate the very minimum requirement.</p>
<p>At least it wasn't the case that I would have to use Material Creation to supply all of our needs. Our main plan was to make use of the drones.</p>
<p>Gnoss had proposed to use nearby asteroids to help form the planet, and Lena went to work on figuring out the details.</p>
<p>These newest drones would be installed with our latest pulsar engine which were powered with my positron, giving them a working cycle of six months. Lena first had me construct her 100 androids which would then be used in the process of creating the space drones. The entire project was overseen by Gnoss. The whole time Thanatos was simply shadowing me, but I eventually tuned her out, becoming absorbed in the creation of androids.</p>
<p>After that was done, we then created the planet core. It was composed of a mix of incredibly dense alloys which I had created, and Lena was tasked with successfully fusing them together, which was quite an easy task considering her quantum computing abilities. Our core boasted a hardness and heat resistance which meant that it wouldn't even dissolve if it were thrown in the sun. Naturally this was mostly due to the materials that I had provided, after all most of them were quite rare even across the universe and it had only been made possible due to my Material Creation ability.</p>
<p>"Johra, the planet core will soon be launched, 10, 9...."</p>
<p>A large, gold looking sphere with a 1000 kilometer diameter floated out into space. It has taken us a whole year to complete, but the core had finally been finished.</p>
<p>"Good morning everyone, I'm Zaira!"</p>
<p>"Who is this? Lena, did you somehow bring Zaira over?"</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha... no, but I knew you'd ask that. Actually since they share much of the same code, I was able to derive her from Lena's programming and insert her into her own core in order to manage the creation of this planet. She is far better suited to the task than Lena who is more of an battle focused A. I."</p>
<p>Lena grumbling could be heard after Gnoss' explanation.</p>
<p>"It's not that I'm not good at defending, it's just that I wanted to have a sister."</p>
<p>"Well it's nice to meet you Lara, I'll leave this planet in your care!"</p>
<p>"Yes, let's create the most wonderful planet in all the universe."</p>
<p>"That sounds awesome, it would indeed be quite the achievement!"</p>
<p>"Johra would you mind picking a name for the planet?"</p>
<p>That very question which Lara had just asked me had become the source of my greatest dilemma yet.</p>
<p>"Uhm... can I take some time to think about it?"</p>
<p>"Sure, there are still 364 days, 19 hours, 16 minutes and 24 seconds to completion."</p>
<p>Ever since that day my worries began. I had spent more than one sleepless night, awake and struggling with what I would name the new planet.</p>
<p>"It'd be best to avoid Necro this time, I think it might have been a small factor as to why the city was wasted last time around. I need to find a name which speaks to future happiness and prosperity...."</p>
<p>"Johra would you like to hear some suggestions?"</p>
<p>Lena who had seen me struggling so hard offered to lend a hand and I had no reason to refuse.</p>
<p>"Sure, let's hear it."</p>
<p>"I was thinking something along the lines of Atlantis, or Heaven or Utopia...."</p>
<p>"Wait! Utopia... that's a good one, I like it!"</p>
<p>I liked the fact that it referred to the creation of an ideal society. Be it in science, economy, politics, it would be perfect in every way."</p>
<p>"That's good, let's go with that."</p>
<p>"Cool, I'll let everyone know."</p>
<p>Shortly after I got everyone's opinion to it.</p>
<p>"Utopia? Sounds nice!"</p>
<p>"What is the meaning of Utopia, Lena?"</p>
<p>Lena transmitted to me the video recordings of everyone's reactions.</p>
<p>"Good, I'm glad so see they all like it."</p>
<p>"Of course, since Johra's choice can't be wrong."</p>
<p>And so the name Utopia had been decided upon. We would strive to create a truly perfect world.</p>
<p>'Is that not another dream of so many people? To create their own world and reign as a God. '</p>
<p>About a month later the drones had proven themselves useful, attaching themselves to small asteroids nearby and gently guiding them on a collision course with our planet core.</p>
<p>"So all I have to do is first resist the initial impact with the Rohim's shield, and then slowly fuse these large rocks with our core?"</p>
<p>"That's about right. It is in fact a bit more complex, but the drones will take care to control the incoming speed and leave enough time between collisions for the assimilation of the asteroids. I can show you the entire process of n this 3D hologram."</p>
<p>Lena showed me the projection for the 300 planned mini collisions over the next six months. Involving a complex calculation which attempted to take into consideration every possible variable.</p>
<p>"I can't understand it at all. Will it all be fine, Gnoss?"</p>
<p>"Yes, just leave it to me, but if ever there is an emergency, we'll be relying on your ability to create positrons."</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>"If we have emergency situation, positrons would be able to resolve the it."</p>
<p>"That one again?"</p>
<p>"Yes. If for some reason something unpredictable occurs like an asteroids arriving to early or being larger than expected, we'd have to blast to bits with the Extinction gun.</p>
<p>"So it will be under Zaira's control?"</p>
<p>"Yes, although this is all theoretical and not something I expect to occur. Still, it is best to be prepared because even between myself and Lena's quantum computing abilities, we can't predict everything with a 100% certainty."</p>
<p>I shook my head while looking the Extinction gun.</p>
<p>"My hope is that it never has to be used."</p>
<p>"Don't worry about it, we will go at this slowly and securely. We've already lined up more than enough asteroids, resulting in 300% more mass than was required by your cursed necklace "</p>
<p>"Great, your plan sounds perfect."</p>
<p>"Well, if Gods don't get involved, everything should be fine."</p>
<p>"Then do you expect them to make an appearance, Gnoss?"</p>
<p>"Well, in truth I have absolutely no idea."</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>"Because while it is true that normally the Gods are restricted from interfering in mortal affairs, Utopia is an entirely different case. The creation of a planet which houses life and therefore generates Divine Grace, is something of incredible importance to Gods. If a large amount of Divine Grace is introduced, then it can even shift the current established hierarchy among Gods."</p>
<p>"Is that so? New worlds create a lot of Divine Grace?"</p>
<p>" Right, They must all be watching this development closely. Between the both of us we can definitely succeed in creating a world which is teeming with life, which would result in a new source of Divine Grace. If it is to their advantage, they may choose to interfere."</p>
<p>"Then if they want to become tenants, they'd first need the permission of the landlord."</p>
<p>"Of course, we'd be the ring leaders here."</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha! Becoming a landlord of the Gods, I like it!"</p>
<p>"You know what you're talking about Johra! Hu hu hu!"</p>
<p>I shook hands with Gnoss and we shared an evil laugh. At that time we both had no idea how impactful that handshake would become in the future. No, perhaps such a result had already been predetermined. I was the only one who had the ability to create such a planet and therefore become a god through the process.</p>
<p>In retrospect the quest given by this cursed God necklace was a bit too suited for me. If I had taken the time to stop and think about it, perhaps I could have discussed these suspicions with Gnoss and fleshed it out. However, the truth was that I had never doubted the entire process, even after the warnings I had received in my dreams. I had already set a course for the destruction of the universe.</p>
<p>Six months later, the first of the larger asteroid collisions began.</p>
<p>"Asteroid A01021 will cross the Roche Limit in 10 seconds."</p>
<p>Hearing her scientific terminology, I asked Gnoss.</p>
<p>"What does she mean by Roche Limit?"</p>
<p>"Ten... nine... eight... seven...."</p>
<p>"It's is when an object crosses a certain threshold of proximity to a planet, after which it is no longer possible to escape the planet's gravitational pull."</p>
<p>The large asteroid was about 100 kilometers wide, but it was now beginning to break apart into smaller pieces. As pieces of it broke off and approached out core, they were turned into fine dust.</p>
<p>"Wow, cool!"</p>
<p>Although Utopia's core was still small, it was incredibly dense so with its attractive force alone, it was able to crumble the asteroid. About 10 hours later the process had been completed and the asteroid formed a thin surface across the core. This layer formed by the asteroid rock gave the planet a color of reddish rust.</p>
<p>"The temperature in the core is now roughly 3,000 degrees whereas the surface is at 1,000 degrees. Initiate the second collision."</p>
<p>The process was repeated 150 times over the next three months. On a regular looking day where the assimilation of asteroids was going smoothly, a hiccup occurred.</p>
<p>"Uhm... we have ourselves a little problem."</p>
<p>"Hm? What is it?"</p>
<p>"Well..." Gnoss began.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 119</p>
<p>"The asteroids have stopped coming."</p>
<p>"What? How is that possible?"</p>
<p>"It seems that those people have decided to intervene."</p>
<p>"Uh... you mean the High Gods?"</p>
<p>I swallowed my saliva nervously.</p>
<p>"Maybe one of those observers finally decided to step in."</p>
<p>"Who are they?"</p>
<p>"Although Gods can be quite powerful, only a few among them are strong enough to restrain asteroids."</p>
<p>"So who could it be? It'd probably be best if we can prepare ourselves in advance."</p>
<p>"We can't be sure, but with that level of strength it must be Atlas or Thor. They sent stronger ones than I expected."</p>
<p>"Try not to look so nervous, this is mostly a show of force to gain some advantage in the upcoming negotiations."</p>
<p>"Right, but if they are so powerful, why don't they just create their own planet."</p>
<p>Gnoss however shook his head and explained.</p>
<p>"Simply having sufficient power isn't enough to create a planet and it isn't easy to escape the inner politics of the Gods. In order to create and rule their own planet, they would probably need a backing on the same level as Metatron or Skyfather."</p>
<p>"I see, so even a God's life is quite complicated."</p>
<p>"Of course, ever since the disappearance of the Supreme Gods, the Gods have almost constantly been at war. Since their awareness is so complete, they can know almost anything that is going on in the universe. This means that they will find many situations to bicker over."</p>
<p>"Hmm... why is it that Gods don't anything regarding the disappearance of these supreme Gods?"</p>
<p>"There are several theories on the subject, but it seems that the two highest Gods, omniscience and omnipotence had argued over something prior to their disappearance."</p>
<p>"Really, what was their argument about?"</p>
<p>"That remains a mystery to all. In fact discovering this truth has been the main goal behind the Gnossian Coalition."</p>
<p>"Ah, right, Gnoss, you were a part of that group!"</p>
<p>"I guessed as much, perhaps when I reincarnated into a human I was influenced somewhat by my past memories and chose my name to reflect that of the organization."</p>
<p>"No wonder they have the same name."</p>
<p>"Right, well actually my memories as Harpok are largely incomplete and I can't remember all those which had joined the Gnossian coalition."</p>
<p>"I see, out of Harpok we had only managed to learn that Gaia had once been a part of it."</p>
<p>"Yes, her I can remember, but as for the information on other members...."</p>
<p>"By the way Gaia will lose her divinity in about 20 years time."</p>
<p>I informed him of a future event which had just come to me.</p>
<p>"What, who did you hear that from?"</p>
<p>"Mikael."</p>
<p>"Ah... that little bastard. That's too bad, Gaia was recognized by all as a great goddess who had won the hearts and mind of all humans alike."</p>
<p>"Well, it only happens in the future."</p>
<p>"Ah right, we're talking about the future now."</p>
<p>Kuwoong—-!</p>
<p>Nautilus had run into an unshakable presence.</p>
<p>"Johra."</p>
<p>Over that past year we had retrofitted Nautilus into a 200 meter high spacecraft. It was outfitted with our strongest Rohim Shield as well as the Tri-force laser cannon, so I was quite confident in its abilities should a space war occur. An existence which could take on the Nautilus' momentum head on wasn't something to be underestimated.</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking that to myself, Gnoss spoke up.</p>
<p>"Just what are those High Gods up to!"</p>
<p>"Come out you foolish mortal! How dare you create this filthy rock in this universe of us gods!"</p>
<p>He stood atop Nautilus' command center holding a giant hammer.</p>
<p>"Thor."</p>
<p>"That's right," Gnoss and I exchanged a knowing smile.</p>
<p>"God of thunder, Thor! How dare you show up to Master's home without permission!"</p>
<p>Thanatos stood before him, her hand turning pitch black.</p>
<p>"Are you a new God of Death? It's my first time seeing you."</p>
<p>Thor rested his hammer on his shoulder and asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Why is it that you are interfering in our work, Thor?"</p>
<p>"Is this your doing? Hm, you also feel like a God, where have I seen you before..."</p>
<p>Thor pondered s he looked at Gnoss.</p>
<p>"I'm Harpok, I just have a different appearance right now."</p>
<p>"Ah, the God of Secrets, I remember now. It was said that you had been captured by Metatron, but it seems you are now free. Are you two the ones behind this?"</p>
<p>"Hey God of Thunder, stop meddling in our affairs."</p>
<p>"Hm... what is that noise? Did I just hear the sound of two mosquitoes talking?"</p>
<p>Thor was obnoxiously pretending not to hear them and I was beginning to become more than a little annoyed by his arrogance.</p>
<p>"Thanatos, you don't need to hold back against him."</p>
<p>"Yes Master."</p>
<p>"What? A God of Death at the beck and call of a mere mortal?"</p>
<p>"Aaaah!"</p>
<p>Thanatos had appeared before him and was grabbing hold of his neck.</p>
<p>"Ha, it was a mistake of yours to get so close to me!"</p>
<p>Boo-wooong!</p>
<p>Thor swung his giant hammer but it hit nothing but empty space.</p>
<p>"That's not good."</p>
<p>"Ha! You may be the God of Thunder, but I'm Death itself, you can't harm me."</p>
<p>"Shit! How annoying."</p>
<p>Thor swung his hammer dozens of times but it passed right through Thanatos as if she were a ghost.</p>
<p>"Why don't you just give up and apologize. You should know by now tha mere thunder can't vanquish death."</p>
<p>"Just why is it that a God of Death serves at the whims of a mortal? Loki, Heimdall, come out and give me a hand!"</p>
<p>Kuuuung Saaah</p>
<p>Within moments a rainbow light appeared and out walked two beings. One with a dark blue cape and the other black.</p>
<p>"Thanatos, come back."</p>
<p>"Yes Master."</p>
<p>We were all now standing outside the Nautilus and it had turned into a 3v3. On out side we had myself, Thanatos and Gnoss, while they had Thor, Loki and Heimdall</p>
<p>"Brother, didn't you say that you had come to negotiate?"</p>
<p>"I was about to start negotiating, Heimdall! Thanks for coming brother. I appreciate your help."</p>
<p>Thor spoek to one of the Gods while wrapping his arm around his neck.</p>
<p>"Let's see, Heimdall the Clairvoyant, Loki the God of Trickery and Thor, God of Thunder. Is it Odin's three little musketeers? Huhuhu... I wonder if Odin is watching as well?"</p>
<p>Gnoss laughed sneakily, whereas Loki gave us a wide smile.</p>
<p>"Of course, Odin is all knowing."</p>
<p>"Bullshit, only the God of Omniscience has that kind of ability. Odin is only slightly better than Heimdall with regards to their awareness."</p>
<p>"Harpok don't go too far, or do you want a taste of my hammer?"</p>
<p>Loki however, quickly interceded on his brother's behalf.</p>
<p>"Stop that Thor, we didn't come here to battle."</p>
<p>"Well despite your position as the herald and your smooth tongue, brother, our purpose has yet to be achieved."</p>
<p>Loki stared at Gnoss in contemplation.</p>
<p>"Huh... well that couldn't be helped, but as you said it's my role."</p>
<p>"Come, spin for me your tales and lies, I, the God of Secrets shall listen to them."</p>
<p>I heard Harpok speak out solemnly.</p>
<p>"How difficult. Father Odin has given me a tall order by asking me to convince this one."</p>
<p>"Hurry up brother, we can't keep this up for too long. Even with our powers stopping such large rocks can only be done for a limited period of time."</p>
<p>"Is Thor helping out?"</p>
<p>"Yes he is, but it's still the same and time is of the essence, you know that if we simply let go...."</p>
<p>"It'll be a catastrophe."</p>
<p>"Why is that?"</p>
<p>I asked curiously.</p>
<p>"Think of it as a stretched out rubber band, what would happen if you let go?"</p>
<p>"Oh I see, you are trying to threaten our planet's core right?"</p>
<p>"Watch your tongue mortal, my hammer alone is enough to claim your puny life."</p>
<p>"Enough brother! Go, I will handle the negotiations."</p>
<p>Loki ordered but Thor stared at him without breaking eye contact. I was upset seeing the situation, but quickly calmed down.</p>
<p>"Gnoss, tell them that I don't respond well to threats."</p>
<p>"Will it be fine?"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"Did you hear that?"</p>
<p>Gnoss said coldly. Loki stayed pensively for a little while before turning to Thor.</p>
<p>"Brother, just get rid of the asteroids."</p>
<p>"What about the negotiations?"</p>
<p>"I think we need to show some good faith first."</p>
<p>"Um..."</p>
<p>"Father had told us that Loki would be in charge in these negotiations."</p>
<p>When Heimdall said that, Thor's face turned ugly.</p>
<p>"Fine, I understand, I'll go back. Tell me the results of this negotiations of yours, brother, else I'll come back and bash their heads in with Mjölnir."</p>
<p>Pazzzzik!</p>
<p>Thor disappeared in a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>"Good, well now that the muscle head is gone, why don't we start the negotiations? In fact, perhaps I should be addressing the one standing beside you. Your name was Johra, right?"</p>
<p>Loki gave a cordial greeting, making me feel at ease.</p>
<p>Loki, how can I negotiate with the God of Trickery?</p>
<p>"My brother Heimdall is very reliable. Thor has the brawns, Heimdall is the most reliable and I have my brains.</p>
<p>A show of strength, then absolute confidence, followed by reason and negotiations. It was a three step scheme to gain a small edge in the talks to come.</p>
<p>"So what do you want to talk about?"</p>
<p>"We know what you are trying to make."</p>
<p>"So?"</p>
<p>"We want a stake in your venture, and in turn we can offer protection."</p>
<p>"But why should we cut you in? Would we have to do the same to any Gods which turn up on our doorstep?"</p>
<p>Gnoss jumped in, he was aware that although Odin and his family were the first to arrive, they would be no means be the last we'd see of the Gods.</p>
<p>"God of Secrets, as you well know, Odin is part of the three strongest Gods. Can you not also see that all three sons of Odin are here to guarantee your protection. Skyfather will not intervene in this matter, which only leaves Metatron, but he isn't in this universe any longer. The other gods are not our opponents."</p>
<p>"There are Gods stronger than Odin. Perhaps not alone, but if Zeus' Olympians join up with the Titans, they would more than be your match, not to mention that there are several other factions out there. What makes you think that you are so superior?"</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha... you are indeed the God of Secrets and already know of all the forces opposed to us. You're right, those powers would definitely intervene should we start to cooperate, but...."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>"We know the whereabouts of Ragnarok's key."</p>
<p>"You do?"</p>
<p>"And that's why we are confident that the other Gods aren't our opponents."</p>
<p>'Huh? A key? I have one of those, but it can't be the one they are talking about. '</p>
<p>"Well... then that's a different story."</p>
<p>"What key is he talking about, Gnoss?"</p>
<p>"It's the key which can bring about the decline of the Gods."</p>
<p>"Decline of the Gods?"</p>
<p>"Right, it's a a key which opens the Tower of the Gods, giving the owner the ability to cause the deaths of all gods, and have their powers reborn into another person. That is except for top Gods like Odin, Skyfather and Metatron.</p>
<p>Hearing that story I was finally convinced that I was in possession of that very key.</p>
<p>"But why is knowing where it is so important?"</p>
<p>"Huh? Well obviously whoever has it can basically decide the life and death of any regular God. The only thing people know about it was that Skyfather had hidden it away, but no one has heard about it since."</p>
<p>"Maybe he's just lying, after all he is Loki."</p>
<p>"If that were the case Heimdall would have said something since she never lies."</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"Are you two finished?"</p>
<p>Loki looked at us with a silly expression.</p>
<p>"Yes, but since you already know the key's location why would you come and negotiate with us? That alone is enough to secure a favorable position amongst the Gods no?"</p>
<p>Loki's face erupted into a crooked smile.</p>
<p>It's because my father wants to break free of Skyfather's rule and create his own Asgard, The key which could allow all that to happen is right over there."</p>
<p>Loki laughed wickedly as he pointed to the pouch hanging to my side. Gnoss however turned towards me, visibly upset.</p>
<p>'What did you want me to do? I didn't know the nature of this key. '</p>
<p>'You should have asked me Johra!'</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 120</p>
<p>I needed to come to a decision and ignore Gnoss' scolding for the moment. If they already knew all about it then I had little choice in the matter.</p>
<p>"Fine, Loki you and your clan shall have your stake in this venture, but in return, be sure to protect Utopia when the time comes."</p>
<p>"That's great news, Johra. I've finally succeeded my mission, how big will our stake be?"</p>
<p>"One percent." Gnoss immediately spoke out. In truth I was about to offer 3 percent, but Gnoss had a shrewder business mind</p>
<p>"That seems a tad low. Is that truly all you can offer, Gnoss?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, you'd best accept this much since it's five times more than you'd get by fighting for it with the other gods."</p>
<p>"Tch! It's hard to one up the God of Secrets, I was expecting to get about 3% from Johra.</p>
<p>"Why do you think that I jumped in."</p>
<p>"Will you allow us to create our own Asgard?"</p>
<p>"We already have a satellite moons which we use as lookouts to monitor for any incoming forces, but it would be a good idea to have another as well to make sure we have better coverage."</p>
<p>"Okay, what size do you want it to be?"</p>
<p>"Somewhere between 150~200 km diameter should be fine, Johra."</p>
<p>I nodded back and went to work. I was confident in leaving the finer details of the negotiations to Gnoss.</p>
<p>"So it's agreed."</p>
<p>"Yes, everything is okay, Heimdall?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I will act as guarantor for this transaction, as Odin has given his blessing."</p>
<p>Paazzzik!</p>
<p>Thor appeared in a flash of lighting.</p>
<p>"So what's the result, brother? Have you made any progress?"</p>
<p>Loki nodded back, then pointed towards Heimdall who agreed as well.</p>
<p>"Well done brother, since we have completed Odin's wishes to the letter, can I return now?"</p>
<p>"Just a moment, Thor. Previously you acted rude towards my master, so if you don't apologize then these negotiations aren't finalized.</p>
<p>Thanatos spoke out in an oppressive manner. She had not said a peep until now, but was suddenly burning with hostility.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I should put a stop to her, but Gnoss stealthily shook his head.</p>
<p>"You! As a God of Death have you no shame, serving this mortal? I've endured and been patient until this point because of my father Odin's command, but you choose to test me? Foolish!"</p>
<p>"Master, let me teach this guy a lesson!"</p>
<p>Thanatos asked me for permission to beat him up, but Gnoss quickly spoke to me telepathically.</p>
<p>'At this point it would be better to have Thor indebted to us due to his rudeness. Odin must have have instructed Thor to listen to Loki's commands during this negotiations, so we can gain something here. '</p>
<p>Although all three of those Gods stood as equals, it was clear that due to Odin's blessings, Loki was above the rest during these talks.</p>
<p>"Trickster Loki, isn't this a breach of our contract?"</p>
<p>"I understand Johra, but you see my brother doesn't really listen to me all that much."</p>
<p>"Well perhaps we should exclude him from our contract then?"</p>
<p>Loki and Gnoss both smiled knowingly.</p>
<p>"Brother, Odin has given me the responsibility of overseeing these negotiations, agreed?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I think you will need to put aside your ego for now, in order for this talks to move forward. Allfather Odin's instructions trump all else."</p>
<p>"Tell me what I should do, brother."</p>
<p>Thor's expression contorted in anger as he understood that he would definitely suffer a loss.</p>
<p>"I, Loki, son of Odin, apologize on behalf of my brother Thor. Furthermore, to ensure the successful negotiations, I order you to serve under sir Johra until the completion of Asgard. Is this not also Odin's will, Heimdall?"</p>
<p>"It is."</p>
<p>"No, brother, for me to serve under a mortal...."</p>
<p>"Are you trying to go against our father, Odin's will?"</p>
<p>Both Loki and Heimdall turned to stare at him seriously and he finally relented, dropping his hammer in defeat.</p>
<p>"You are right, Loki. I must follow father's will."</p>
<p>Despite his great pride, Thor walked before me and bowed his head.</p>
<p>"Please forgive my previous rudeness."</p>
<p>Thanatos still had her arms crossed in dissatisfaction, but I was glad instead. Having a strong God at the forefront would certainly help dissuade other Gods form meddling in our affairs.</p>
<p>It was a scheme agreed upon between Loki and Gnoss after just a quick glance at one another. We both benefited from the result, as Loki was able to make a rival brother of his suffer while we gained the employ of a God.</p>
<p>'Johra, Odin should be aware of all that has been going on here because Heimdall can communicate telepathically with him regardless of the distances. That is why Thor was quick to succumb. ' Heimdall's word is the same as if it had come from Odin.</p>
<p>'Ah, is that so'</p>
<p>'Right, Heimdall is not only a God, but also acts as Odin's Messiah. It's a complex and close relationship, but it seems that in the end the result is quite favorable for us. '</p>
<p>The negotiations complete, Loki and Heimdall left to return to Odin's side, while Thor stayed behind, standing in the command center of the Nautilus feeling dejected.</p>
<p>However, we were able to quickly change his mood as Lena got a couple androids to brew several barrels of ale. He seemed to become alive after drinking the beer, but the subsequent singing which sounded like that of drunken sailors was hard to put up with.</p>
<p>"Is that drunk really Thor, the God of Thunder?"</p>
<p>"Yes, when he drinks his personality is completely different. Still, he's the same Thor who is top 3 among Gods regarding brute force.</p>
<p>He soon passed out, having drunk too much, but perhaps due to his divinity he recovered quickly. Gnoss then passed by and put him to work.</p>
<p>"That one's really huge, how is he able to move it so effortlessly."</p>
<p>"Electromagnetism, since he's the God of Thunder, he can move those large asteroids if they are rich in iron."</p>
<p>"Ah, so it was like that."</p>
<p>Much like the drones used by Lena, Thor was using his electromagnetic abilities to move forces that were otherwise beyond his power.</p>
<p>"It's a great thing to have this God of Thunder working for us."</p>
<p>"Finally something that muscles head is useful for."</p>
<p>Thanatos exclaimed coldly from the side. She still held a grudge against him. Although I appreciated the fact that she had stepped up to defend me, It was now a bit too much since we were on the same side so I had to have a word with her.</p>
<p>"Thor is our ally now, so do try and go easy on him."</p>
<p>"I understand that much, so as long as he doesn't cause any mishaps I won't go too far. I just don't like him though."</p>
<p>Thanatos spat out and left the command post. Normally she would go went on Krishna if she didn't agree with something.</p>
<p>"Gnoss, was the name of Thor's hammer Mjölnir?"</p>
<p>"Right, it's actually the main source of Thor's power. His father Odin bestowed it upon him."</p>
<p>"Oh, then how do you think it would match up versus Krishna?"</p>
<p>"Ah... well even if Krishna is an artifact, Mjölnir is a weapon which has been personally blessed by Odin, so perhaps it's a bit stronger?"</p>
<p>"I see, just don't say that in front of Krishna, he would surely get angry."</p>
<p>"Naturally."</p>
<p>Gnoss and I both stared at Mjölnir curiously, wondering how it would feel to one day hold it in our hands.</p>
<p>Shortly after delegations from Zeus' and Ra's factions arrived, but they were turned back through Thor's sheer might. Three months later, Utopia was finally completed.</p>
<p>"Ten... nine... eight...."</p>
<p>"Ah~ are we finally finished?"</p>
<p>"Yes and no, although the size of the planet is there, the real hard work begins now. We will need to terraform the surface in order to create a hospitable environment which can accommodate life. This here are some of the proposals which Zaira had put forth, there are over 100,000 of them which require your immediate attention."</p>
<p>"What? Can't you just take care of this?"</p>
<p>"Nonsense, in the first place you were the one who wanted to micromanage the development of Utopia down to the very detail."</p>
<p>"Ah... but 100,000...."</p>
<p>"Fusion is complete, waiting for temperature to cool to proceed."</p>
<p>"As soon as Lena finished her announcement a string of messages appeared before me.</p>
<p>[Race has changed to Evolutionary God]</p>
<p>[Became God of Creation]</p>
<p>[Utopia Planet]</p>
<p>[All skills have been restored]</p>
<p>[You have learned Thought Creation Lv1]</p>
<p>[You have learned Indestructible Lv1]</p>
<p>[You have learned Immortality Lv1]</p>
<p>[You have learned Space Restoration Lv1]</p>
<p>[Acquired ｟Title: Revival｠]</p>
<p>Countless more skills and titles appeared but I wasn't able to focus on them due to the wailing of a siren</p>
<p>"Warning! Warning! An incoming Solar Flare has been detected. It's trajectory has been determined to be on a collision course with planet Utopia and will arrive in 15 minutes and 24 seconds."</p>
<p>"Damn High God lunatics! They made a star's corona explode."</p>
<p>"What kind of damage are we looking at Lena?"</p>
<p>"It's radius is expected to be that of 5,000 km upon impact and can blow up half the planet.</p>
<p>"Those greedy pigs! They can't swallow up any of it so they choose to blow it up! This must be either Apollo or Ra's doing!"</p>
<p>I was distressed by the urgency in Gnoss' voice. True, I had just become a God, but I had no way in preventing the incoming catastrophe.</p>
<p>"How about the Extinction gun?"</p>
<p>"It would help, but it won't be enough as it could only block part of it."</p>
<p>"Worry not, God of Secrets, how dare they send this our way when they know that I, Thor and here!"</p>
<p>Paazzzik!</p>
<p>Thor turned into a streak of lightning and flew out towards the incoming sun.</p>
<p>"Can he really stop it by himself?"</p>
<p>"Well, we don't have much of a choice but to rely on him, but even if he succeeds he won't come out unscathed."</p>
<p>"Then why didn't you stop him from going?"</p>
<p>"As a God, if you encounter something with exceeds your strength you will still be wounded. He won't die, but the recovery process would be quite lengthy."</p>
<p>"Well this is the reason which Odin sent Thor over here. I guess Odin is listening in on our conversation, so the reason he isn't showing up is that he is confident in Thor's abilities.</p>
<p>"Isn't this father asking a bit too much out of his son?"</p>
<p>"They have a complicated relationship. Some legends even claim that their is a power struggle between them in which they need to keep their strengths in check."</p>
<p>"Sounds troublesome."</p>
<p>"Shh, we don't know if that old guy is listening."</p>
<p>After a short time Lena spoke up.</p>
<p>"A large hole has appeared in the center of the incoming solar flare, so it shouldn't affect planet Utopia too badly."</p>
<p>"Ah, how fortunate."</p>
<p>"Well, there's another problem, Johra."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"Take a look at that."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 121</p>
<p>"Um... why are there so many balls of light?"</p>
<p>"We have detected hundreds of bodies of energy approaching from 3 o'clock."</p>
<p>Lena announced ominously.</p>
<p>"I see, it seems that the Egyptian Gods and Olympians have finally made their move."</p>
<p>"Ah, then was the earlier solar flare just a ruse to lure out Thor?"</p>
<p>"Possibly...."</p>
<p>Flash!</p>
<p>Suddenly a bunch of rainbow lights appeared in Nautilus' command center as dozens of gods appeared.</p>
<p>"Johra, Odin has sent over reinforcements as per our contract."</p>
<p>Loki appeared and spoke cordially.</p>
<p>"Thank you, but do we even have a way to deal with so many Gods?"</p>
<p>I turned to Gnoss and asked.</p>
<p>"Well... maybe if we slow down time, giving Thor a chance to return. By the way Loki, is your father not coming? I would have expected him to join us in such an emergency."</p>
<p>Loki's expression became uncomfortable as he answered.</p>
<p>"Well, not too long ago he was tasked by Skyfather to participate in a mission, maybe...."</p>
<p>"Ah, so the Olympians might have had a hand in this."</p>
<p>Loki nodded back solemnly.</p>
<p>"Damn! We simply don't have any chance of winning this encounter. How will be get out of this one? Are we going to have to buy time and simply wait for a miracle?"</p>
<p>Arms crossed, I was only half listening to the conversations going on around me, as I focused on a single thought.</p>
<p>"Johra?"</p>
<p>It was only then that I snapped out of it and responded.</p>
<p>"Just give me as much time as you can."</p>
<p>"Alright, did you hear that Loki?"</p>
<p>"We'll do as you said. In the name of the almighty Odin, to battle!"</p>
<p>"For Odin!"</p>
<p>They fired up their powers and rushed towards the incoming Gods.</p>
<p>"I'll go join them, Johra."</p>
<p>"Okay, but if you see that it's getting too dangerous make sure to run away and save your life, alright Thanatos?"</p>
<p>Bowing down momentarily, she then straightened herself up and vanished into a dark shadow.</p>
<p>"Gnoss, how much time do we have?"</p>
<p>"Uhm... Lena?"</p>
<p>"What is our distance from the enemy?"</p>
<p>"About two AU."</p>
<p>She went silent as she made her complicated calculations, before responding.</p>
<p>"Considering the distance and factoring more or less how much time the Norse Gods can buy, I'd say three hours at best, if we're unlucky then two."</p>
<p>"Good, Is the Extincition gun on the Nautilus operational?"</p>
<p>"Sure... but it won't be enough against these Gods. The energy output would have to be at least 10,000 times stronger."</p>
<p>"I'll begin preparations."</p>
<p>"Huh? Didn't you just hear me? It's not possible, you'd need to make it 10,000 times stronger."</p>
<p>"I know, but are you aware what kind of God I am?"</p>
<p>"What? You became a God? No wonder I couldn't check your status anymore."</p>
<p>"God of Creation."</p>
<p>"God of Creation, what kind of God is that? I've never heard of it before...."</p>
<p>"I'm the God of all things that have been made with the ability to enhance all creation. I feel like I'm the first and last of my kind."</p>
<p>"Ah! It's normal for one to understand their own ability best, but now that I think about it, the first God was said to have such a power. Wait, first and last? Is that even possible? I'm pretty sure that when a God dies then his power is reborn in another right?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"I'm not sure about that, but I just know that if I were to die, no one would gain this power. Still, as I'm an Immortal God then I can't die, right?"</p>
<p>"Well... it's not certain. If you are attacked by a certain power which exceeds your threshold, since you don't have immortality and indestructible body at MaxLv, then it is possible that you are destroyed by one terrifying blow."</p>
<p>"So it comes down to power. Well, as the God of Creation, I should be able to enhance the power of stuff which has been built."</p>
<p>"So anything which has been built? Are you some kind of engineering God?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps, let's not waste any more time and quickly begin construction of the Extinction gun."</p>
<p>"Sounds like fun! Join us Lena."</p>
<p>We headed to the center of the Nautilus and arrived in a large room where Lena projected the components and assembly instructions.</p>
<p>"Will you be able to complete it, Johra?"</p>
<p>"I'll need some time. It's quite the complex device isn't it?"</p>
<p>"Of course, it is afterall the most powerful weapon which was made after combining the research of humanity across two universes."</p>
<p>"Well, I feel like it shouldn't be so hard to enhance, the capacity here just needs to be tweaked...."</p>
<p>"What, you've already found some deficiencies? Johra, how's that possible? I thought it would take you much longer."</p>
<p>"I spent a whole hour examining the plans before calling for her."</p>
<p>"Lena."</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"Help place the Extinction gun in the designated location of the magic circle I will draw in the hologram."</p>
<p>I drew a nice magic circle based on the previous one Lena had designed, but improved on certain areas and included four main cores.</p>
<p>"Looks cool, but I've never seen some of those symbols before. I wonder how it works.</p>
<p>"I'll explain it to you and Gnoss later on, so for now just focus on helping out."</p>
<p>"Okay, what can I do?"</p>
<p>"Material Creation"</p>
<p>I began to construct a circuit board to guide the firing mechanism of the gun.</p>
<p>"Oh! Is that a circuit board you're building?"</p>
<p>"Right, I can build anything that I can imagine. It's a combination of the previous skills and new one Thought Creation"</p>
<p>"It sounds cool, so where do you place the circuit board?"</p>
<p>"How should I know? Lena, where does it go?"</p>
<p>"Ah, understood!"</p>
<p>After installing it, Gnoss and I backed off and focused on the energy source.</p>
<p>"And for the last part, Create Magic Stone!"</p>
<p>I held a large magic stone using both hands.</p>
<p>"Wow, Johra you've definitely improved. Last time around, when you were a Demi-Lich you could only create a magic stone the size of your fist, but now it's more than ten times bigger."</p>
<p>"Lena, open up the compartment for the magic stone."</p>
<p>"Opening the section now."</p>
<p>Whirriiing—!</p>
<p>I place the stone in the weapons core and turned to Gnoss.</p>
<p>"Let's head back to the command center."</p>
<p>"Yes! I definitely can't wait to see the destructive powers of this new Hyper-Extinction gun!"</p>
<p>"Hyper?"</p>
<p>I asked Gnoss as we ran along the hallways.</p>
<p>"Ah, you don't like it? Should I change the name?"</p>
<p>"I think its fine, Johra."</p>
<p>Lena piped up. Although I felt it was a bit of a strange name, I decided to let it slide.</p>
<p>When we arrive to the command bridge I instructed Lena.</p>
<p>"Begin the countdown."</p>
<p>"Yes Sir!"</p>
<p>Suddenly all the lights turned off.</p>
<p>"Uhm, is there some kind of problem? Is it not safe to fire?"</p>
<p>"No Johra, Lena just turned off the lights to build the mood, it was a good idea."</p>
<p>Gnoss added, but I couldn't help but grumble. I had already adjusted the output to take into consideration how much energy it took to power the Nautilus, but it seemed to have been wasted effort.</p>
<p>"Rerouting all power sources to fire up the weapon. Requesting permission to begin the start up sequence for the Hyper-Extinction gun."</p>
<p>"Make sure to give me a countdown, Lena. Also, contact the Norse Gods and Thanatos and inform them to escape the blast zone. They should be able to return back here to the bridge with that same rainbow ability from earlier, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I've just spoken to them and they'll be here soon."</p>
<p>"Understood, target locked on!"</p>
<p>Gnoss and Lena answered me almost simultaneously.</p>
<p>PPip Ppip</p>
<p>The projected trajectory appeared on the screen before us.</p>
<p>"Charging at 98%"</p>
<p>The gauge marking the gun's energy levels was almost full.</p>
<p>"Turning on the beam amplifier!"</p>
<p>"Turning off all safety locks."</p>
<p>The five lights which represented the safety devices we had in place began blinking on the screen before me.</p>
<p>"It's quite the lengthy process."</p>
<p>"It's normal, we need to make sure it's secure since it has more than enough power to blow up an entire sun."</p>
<p>"Hmm I guess so."</p>
<p>"10...9...8...7...6...5...4...4.................................. Fire!"</p>
<p>Quaaah!</p>
<p>Perfectly timed, a rainbow light shone on the bridge as the dozens of Gods reappeared.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you've made it back safely,Loki, and thanks for taking Thanatos along with you."</p>
<p>"Of course, but just what wa that thing that just fired? I felt an incredibly ominous energy coming my way."</p>
<p>"It's the Hyper-Extinction gun! Ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>Although Gnoss shouted out excitedly, Loki only nodded back in a serious manner.</p>
<p>"A fitting name, if such powerful magic actually hits a God head on, it might even be able to immediately destroy them."</p>
<p>"Impact confirmed. EMP shock is expected to arrive in 20 seconds, brace for impact."</p>
<p>"Hmm, EMP shock? I thought that the Rohim shield was able to deal with that?"</p>
<p>I asked Gnoss but he shook his head.</p>
<p>"That was true for the gun's previous version, but this one is much more powerful, so it's unlikely to hold up."</p>
<p>"Is that so?"</p>
<p>"Shutting down all power function except the shield to protect them from the EMP."</p>
<p>Kiiiiing</p>
<p>A silence pervaded the bridge as all the lights were once again turned off.</p>
<p>"Johra this feels fun."</p>
<p>Thanatos exclaimed happily.</p>
<p>"So... did it work?"</p>
<p>Pazzzzzic</p>
<p>Shortly after Thor appeared in a flash of lightning.</p>
<p>"Brother, you've come."</p>
<p>"Yes, I was given charge of the Asgardian elites by our father Odin."</p>
<p>"Yes, I saw your battle from afar, but before I returned I witnessed a dangerous looking magic spell being fired."</p>
<p>"Johra here has used his Extinction gun to defeat our numerous adversaries."</p>
<p>"Hmm... but it seems that he didn't get all of them."</p>
<p>Thor pointed out to the five lights which were still making their way towards us.</p>
<p>"Judging by their colors, it seems to be Zeus, Hera, Hades, Ra and Horus."</p>
<p>Gnoss said as he let out a groan.</p>
<p>"Are they the strongest ones?"</p>
<p>"That would be an understatement. Even if we were to combine the strength of all the other Gods we just defeated, they'd be inferior to just those five alone. Perhaps Thor can deal with only one of those five."</p>
<p>"Right, even combining our strengths I don't know if we can deal with them. At most we can handle 3 of them."</p>
<p>"Then what are we supposed to do?"</p>
<p>"We can delay for time once more, but I don't think they'll give us that chance."</p>
<p>"Hmmm...."</p>
<p>"We can't know the result before we've clashed, I'll choose to believe in Mjölnir."</p>
<p>I turned to look at Thor.</p>
<p>"Your weapon, Thor. Can it be that it was made by Odin?"</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>"Just what are you thinking Johra? Are you planning on even improving a God's creation?"</p>
<p>"Well we won't know unless we try, right? Thor, could you hand it over to me one moment?"</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>Thor's booming laughter rang in the bridge.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 122</p>
<p>"Fool! You've only just become a God and you wish to wield my weapon which only a chosen one can touch. If an unclean soul touches Mjölnir then you can die instantly, do you still dare grab it?"</p>
<p>He asked as he tossed his hammer towards me.</p>
<p>'Um... should I not touch it then? Would it be possible to analyze it without touching?'</p>
<p>I contemplated as I looked down at Mjölnir which had fallen at my feet. Thor meanwhile was emitting a disgusting laughter.</p>
<p>"No, Johra don't!"</p>
<p>Gnoss tried to dissuade me as I reached forth, but in the end I grasped its handle. Thor however looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p>"What! How is it that you are able to touch it? That's ridiculous, only the chosen one can do so!"</p>
<p>Ignoring his screams, I began to peer within Mjölnir.</p>
<p>"How wonderful, it's like a perfect balance between science and magic...."</p>
<p>"Right, there's a tale that when creating Mjölnir, Odin poured in all his knowledge regarding magic and science... it seems for once the stories are true."</p>
<p>Gnoss replied in a mumble and I nodded back.</p>
<p>"Is that the device which allows one to multiply the amount of Mana you can wield? And Thor wields electromagnetic powers...."</p>
<p>"Yes, he's the God of Thunder."</p>
<p>"Of course! I'm the King of all Thunder, now stop playing around with my weapon and return it to me!"</p>
<p>"Pipe down you! Gnoss, keep that guy under control until I'm done."</p>
<p>"What, how am I supposed to control a Muscle head like him?"</p>
<p>I placed Mjölnir on the desk before me and took my time to analyze it properly.</p>
<p>"Hmm... why is that limiter in place? It should be able to produce a stronger output if it weren't there. So might it overcharge if I did so, perhaps I should exchange the mana stones inside for better ones."</p>
<p>"Create Magic Stone"</p>
<p>I created five of my my oversized manastones and brought them towards Mjölnir's core."</p>
<p>Shh Shh Shh</p>
<p>"Quite convenient, it's able to absorb the stones by itself? So if I change this here, and this, let's see... the electromagnetic force generated is quite nice, but there is another limiter here as well."</p>
<p>Shortly after I was done with my modifications and threw the hammer back to Thor.</p>
<p>"Thor, take it! Just be careful not to destroy the ship, okay? The power output might be a bit different than what you are used to."</p>
<p>Pazzik!</p>
<p>As soon as Thor help Mjölnir, he turned into a streak of light and flew out into space.</p>
<p>"Hmm... is he fine? Maybe he just needs some time to adjust to his weapons new power. Thanatos?"</p>
<p>"Did you call for me, Master?"</p>
<p>"Huh!"</p>
<p>I jumped up in surprise due to her appearing behind me like a ghost.</p>
<p>"You surprised me, next time try to appear in a more normal fashion."</p>
<p>"But what if I like seeing your surprised expression?"</p>
<p>"Too bad, can you go and fetch me Krishna."</p>
<p>"Okay~"</p>
<p>As Thanatos vanished Gnoss approached.</p>
<p>"What happened with Thor?"</p>
<p>"He isn't used to his new hammer yet...."</p>
<p>Pazzik!</p>
<p>"What have you done to Mjölnir?"</p>
<p>Thor reappeared in a resounding thunder, flashing in and out of space, testing his new abilities.</p>
<p>"Nothing much, just removed certain limiters, replaced the magic stones and made small alterations to compensate for its new output."</p>
<p>"I can't believe it, does that mean that I'm more powerful than father Odin right now?"</p>
<p>"That isn't true power, well anyways it seems our guests have arrived"</p>
<p>"Ok, Loki, warriors of Asgard, follow me into battle!"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>Quaaaaakkka</p>
<p>Thor's thunderous power eclipsed all others and drew my attention.</p>
<p>"I wonder if it'll be more of an even fight now?"</p>
<p>"Johra, how is Thor now?"</p>
<p>Gnoss walked over and asked?</p>
<p>"Maybe 10 times stronger than previously. Actually the output of energy form Mjölnir has increased somewhere between 40-50 times, but he hasn't had the chance to adapt to it yet.</p>
<p>"No way...."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Well then perhaps Thor is stronger than Odin now."</p>
<p>"Really, the difference between them was only 10 times?"</p>
<p>"Well in actuality it used to only be maybe 3-4 times. It's a difference in their abilities since Odin is the God of Wisdom and Knowledge, whereas Thor's abilities are more battle oriented."</p>
<p>"Ah, then those limiters I found in Mjölnir make a lot more sense."</p>
<p>"Limiters?"</p>
<p>"Right, there were certain safety devices in place which would control Mjölnir's energy output. At first I thought it was that the weapon itself couldn't pass a certain threshold, but now I suspect there was another reason."</p>
<p>"Well, isn't Odin quite the perfectionist?</p>
<p>"Seems so."</p>
<p>After a short time what looked like a giant display of fireworks could be seen, far into space as the Gods clashed in battle. The bright blue lightning appeared to be the work of Thor, and the contrast with the dark, black space was put on quite the show.</p>
<p>"I think it would be more appropriate to call it an explosion, rather than simple lightning."</p>
<p>"Right, what are his power readings at?"</p>
<p>"Energy emissions at about 10 ^21 eV, which is almost enough to destabilize the fabric of the universe. Even though we've enhanced the Nautilus' defense and are so far away from battle, it's taking a beating at the moment."</p>
<p>Lena followed up with a detailed explanation, but it didn't seem to do the blue lightning justice. It was like a giant blue sun had exploded into streaks of light, blazing across the universe.</p>
<p>"So you've come."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>Following a bright yellow light, Odin joined us on the bridge.</p>
<p>'Odin? Didn't he say that he was on a mission for Skyfather?'</p>
<p>"Maybe it was just an excuse, he likes to control things from behind the scenes."</p>
<p>'But why did he only set out now?'</p>
<p>"I suppose a certain variable has appeared."</p>
<p>'Variable?'</p>
<p>"You've essentially given Thor a pair of new wings."</p>
<p>"You mean Mjölnir?"</p>
<p>"Right, If Thor beat everyone by himself, it might undermine Odin's authority."</p>
<p>Shortly after, the dozens of Norse gods reappeared in Nautilus' command bridge.</p>
<p>"Revered Allfather Odin, you've come!"</p>
<p>Thor cried out as he raised his hammer, then along with the rest of the Gods from Asgard, descended on one knee.</p>
<p>I couldn't see well with so many bright lights, but when it finally came to an end, I saw a group of six Gods.</p>
<p>"So it's those guys."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 123</p>
<p>My face turned into a frown at his appearance.</p>
<p>'Johra, it isn't a good time to confront them. We still need to bide our time and amass power. '</p>
<p>"So you've come, we are sincerely glad you could make it."</p>
<p>He greeted the new arrival cordially while I stood back and watched.</p>
<p>"Enough of all this ass kissing"</p>
<p>The God cloaked in a blue nimbus spoke out, I assumed that he would be Zeus.</p>
<p>"GodKing Zeus, did you not come here to negotiate?"</p>
<p>The one eyed God basking in a violet aura spoke out. It was probably Odin since he confronted Zeus so brusquely.</p>
<p>"Allfather, seeing you here today, I have indeed chosen to sue for peace, but not for that traitor and rookie God."</p>
<p>"Thanatos."</p>
<p>"Chit"</p>
<p>I called her back since she was already walking towards Zeus with her hand surrounded by a black fog.</p>
<p>"GodKing Zeus, I hope that you haven't forgotten that many of our followers were severely harmed by that insignificant new God. If it were not for the abilities of your wife, Hera, perhaps we would be all that's left of our clans.</p>
<p>The god surrounded by a golden nimbus spoke out. He was likely Ra, the Egyptian Sun God. According to him, many of the Olympus and Egyptian Gods only survived due to Hera's assistance.</p>
<p>'So many of them survived due to Hera's ability, that's too bad. '</p>
<p>'Maybe they were transferred to a seperate space using her powers. Heimdall also has a similar ability, it makes for quite the useful escaping skill. '</p>
<p>Gnoss gave me a quick rundown on their powers.</p>
<p>'Still they couldn't have all escaped. It's just as Ra just said, many of them have taken severe losses. If not for that fact, perhaps they would have already overpowered our Norse allies and we wouldn't be in these talks. '</p>
<p>"Harpok, you dare betray your own kind, the Egyptian Gods...."</p>
<p>"Although I indeed carry many memories of Harpok, I have no intention of returning to the family. Where were you when Harpok was captured and held prisoner by Metatron. There already exists a river's distance between us that I'm not willing to cross, I'm sure you understand."</p>
<p>Gnoss responded coldly to Ra. No doubt he had already made up his mind on this issue.</p>
<p>"GodKing Zeus, I, Allfather Odin wish to declare this planet Utopia as being under my protection. Do you accept this NAP (Non Aggression Pact)?"</p>
<p>Odin declared in a booming voice. Zeus proceed to stroke his beard pensively before finally responding.</p>
<p>"I'll take a 5% share, that's my bottom line. I need to leave with this much tribute to save face, or else we would go back to fighting."</p>
<p>"What? That's far too much Zeus, how dare you!"</p>
<p>Thor barks out but Odin quickly moves to silence him.</p>
<p>I will put the question to my ally, Johra. We can split the cost with you half-half, what do you think?"</p>
<p>Odin asked me directly.</p>
<p>I exchanged a look with Gnoss before nodding back.</p>
<p>"Allfather Odin, we are willing to fork over 4% while you give the other 1%. This will be the concessions made on our part to ensure peace."</p>
<p>Odin stared at me with his one eye before nodding.</p>
<p>"GodKing Zeus, you've come here today filled with foolish greed, seeking what is not rightfully yours. However we are magnanimous, so consider this Divine Grace as a token of our goodwill. Leave now, in the future it is not necessary for you to return to this place."</p>
<p>" 흐흐흐 ...let's go."</p>
<p>The Gods which were associated with Zeus' group disappeared from the Nautilus' bridge in an instant.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your compromise, because of this we didn't have to undergo any unnecessary fighting. It seemed that they were ready to unleash the Gods which were hidden in Hera's space, so I'm glad that we avoided any further bloodshed."</p>
<p>Odin let out a sigh of relief, as he acknowledged that the danger had passed.</p>
<p>"Great, does this not deserve a victory toast? Bring out the booze! I want red meat and fresh fruit!"</p>
<p>"I'll do so," Lena replied to Thor's whimsical demands.</p>
<p>'Damn... I hope Thor controls his eating. '</p>
<p>We ended up throwing a medieval style banquet to celebrate our victory with our Asgard allies. Lena had walked me through a system by with I could use me Creation abilities to make food which has already been cooked to perfection.</p>
<p>"Fresh fruit, it takes like a freshly picked apple from Freya's tree, and the mead! It flows like honey down our throats!</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha! Thor, won't Freya get angry with you again if you overdo it?"</p>
<p>Thor was quite the party boy and had downed a few barrels of ale by himself. Well, in general these Asgard Gods were all big drinkers, which kept Lena and myself quite busy trying to keep up with the demand.</p>
<p>"Johra, didn't you just achieve Godhood? Are you not confused by your new powers and position?"</p>
<p>Before me sat Odin, Loki and Heimdall, leisurely drinking and filling their stomachs.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your concern, but no, I'm not confused."</p>
<p>"Well, it is true that you have been trying to become a God for quite some time now."</p>
<p>Odin replied somewhat snarkily.</p>
<p>"Allfather Odin, Johra had never been aiming to be a regular God, but rather a powerhouse which could establish himself even among divinities.</p>
<p>Gnoss spoke out proudly as if her were naming his own achievements, causing Odin to frown.</p>
<p>"You erased all those obstacles I had put in place in order for that troublesome son of mine not to surpass me."</p>
<p>'Ugh... so he knows that removing the limiters was my doing. '</p>
<p>In truth I didn't expect for a wise and experienced God like Odin to miss that, but still I never thought that he'd confront me directly.</p>
<p>" A child grows up in his father's shadow, but it would be irresponsible on the latter's part to limit his sons growth. Allfather Odin, do you truly wish for Thor to hide in your shadow for all eternity?"</p>
<p>I stared back at Odin and gave him a sharp response.</p>
<p>"Pua haha! When has anyone spoke to me, Allfather Odin in such a way! I thought that my son Thor was bold, but here I find out you are even more so! Come, a toast to our alliance!"</p>
<p>Odin and I brought our mugs together and downed our drinks.</p>
<p>"A toast, to the eternal glory and dominion of the Gods!"</p>
<p>Odin took a drinking before looking at me.</p>
<p>"Then I'll toast to everlasting peace and development!"</p>
<p>"Cheers!"</p>
<p>The toasts continued throughout the banquet, which ended up lasting a full month.</p>
<p>Odin would tell stories about his past while I would recount tales of my struggles as a mortal.</p>
<p>"Well, all good things have to come to an end! It's time to go back and begin building our very own Asagard! Children of Odin, come, lend me your strength to build this new land together!"</p>
<p>"Oooh!"</p>
<p>They headed towards Utopia's orbiting moon which they had named, Asgard. Teleporting through the aid of Heimdall's Bitfrost Rainbow.</p>
<p>"Johra, my ally! I will now head to Asgard, just call if you require any assistance."</p>
<p>"Allfather Odin the one-eyed! Thank you for your patronage!"</p>
<p>After nodding back, he turned into a crow and disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>"That looked like Huginn."</p>
<p>Gnoss mumbled to himself as Odin left.</p>
<p>"Huginn?"</p>
<p>"Odin can transform into two different ravens, Huginn and Muninn. As Huginn he can travel to any place he can think of, and Muninn can even alter time."</p>
<p>"How convenient."</p>
<p>"He's Allfather. It's said that he has the widest array of abilities and a great mastery of their utilization. If Skyfather can be said to be a powerful tidal wave, then Odin is a jack of all trades."</p>
<p>"Yes, but I wonder how strong Skyfather truly is...."</p>
<p>"Just imagine the strongest God possible."</p>
<p>"Wouldn't that be the Almighty God?"</p>
<p>"He would then be the closest one to the Almighty."</p>
<p>"Hmm... how did you know that he wouldn't interfere this time around?"</p>
<p>"Well... usually he is very absorbed in his own projects. This is just a single measly planet so it shouldn't catch his attention."</p>
<p>"That means if we go too far he'd surely intervene."</p>
<p>"Right, and Johra for you that would be...."</p>
<p>"Terrible."</p>
<p>I finished his sentence resulting in an awkward silence. Finally I spoke up.</p>
<p>"Although my body is fine, my mind is exhausted. I'll get some rest"</p>
<p>"You must have overdrawn your powers, Johra."</p>
<p>"You're in charge here.</p>
<p>I headed back to my cabin and laid down to get some sleep.</p>
<p>"Damn, so many things have happened so suddenly...."</p>
<p>I ended up falling asleep despite having so many things on my mind.</p>
<p>"Johra! It's soon!"</p>
<p>"Oh, so you're back."</p>
<p>The person in my dreams appeared to be in quite the playful mood.</p>
<p>"Weren't you wishing to see me?"</p>
<p>"I was?"</p>
<p>"The reason I returned was that I was drawn by your desire to see me."</p>
<p>"Is that even possible?"</p>
<p>"Oh, and by the way... I guess it's about time for the doors a destiny to open up."</p>
<p>"Doors of destiny?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Johra, are you still incomplete? Perhaps it is not yet time then."</p>
<p>"Hey! What are these doors of destiny you spoke of? Hello? Hey!"</p>
<p>I was once again talking to myself in my own dreams.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 124</p>
<p>"Damn!"</p>
<p>I woke from my dream all grumpy and miserable. Clearly there had been something important that I just missed out on.</p>
<p>"I couldn't have been a normal dream, right?"</p>
<p>"Johra did you once again see that fellow in your dreams?"</p>
<p>Lena asked.</p>
<p>"I think so. I had another one of those bad dreams, but just what are the doors of destiny."</p>
<p>"Doors of destiny... it sounds quite poetic. Why don't you try and ask Gnoss about it?"</p>
<p>"Good idea, where is he right now?"</p>
<p>"Supervising some work on the ship. I'll contact him for you."</p>
<p>"Thanks."</p>
<p>"I told him to meet you on the command bridge in one hour."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>I prepared myself a warm bath, then sank right in.</p>
<p>"Hooah~! It doesn't matter if one is a God or a mortal, the feeling is always great."</p>
<p>"Are you enjoying your bath, Johra?"</p>
<p>"Yes, the temperature is just right."</p>
<p>"Ok, I'll modify the environment to match the mood. I'll make it a wide and limitless desert, with a bright starry sky above. As for the weather, let's go with an early fall breeze."</p>
<p>"Woah... isn't this the same one you used when I first slept with Viezda?"</p>
<p>"Oh, so you haven't forgotten. Then please take a moment and let your mind wander back to that time, you've had too much on your plate recently."</p>
<p>"Ok, just wake me up when it's time."</p>
<p>I felt all my accumulated stress slowly dissipate, as I listened to the chirping of crickets and felt the gentle wind rustle my hair.</p>
<p>Beep!</p>
<p>Is it time already?</p>
<p>I woke up to the alarm, but I was no longer inside the Nautilus.</p>
<p>"What's going on? Wasn't it supposed to be a hologram? Lena?"</p>
<p>"Oh, Johra! We've lost communication with Headquarters, this is most definitely not the Nautilus. Still, it's incredible, the environment which I had projected actually became a reality...."</p>
<p>"Lena, focus on what's important. I was only asleep a short time, so how did I arrive to this place?"</p>
<p>"Well for one, the constellations appear far different than what we are used to, but the composition of the atmosphere is similar to that of Earth."</p>
<p>"Interesting, still I don't want to stay here long. Please prepare a teleportation circle to return to the dungeon manor."</p>
<p>"Um, it might take a while to do so due to the fact that we are in an unknown location. The calculations required are quite complex."</p>
<p>"Oh, how long should it take?"</p>
<p>"I expect it to be about 48 hours, turning off all unnecessary functions to reroute power for the calculations."</p>
<p>"Lena, Lena! Dammit at least ask for approval first!"</p>
<p>Here I was, sitting in my bathtub alone in the middle of a desert.</p>
<p>"I guess I should put some clothes one. Can I make my own? Let's see...."</p>
<p>I focused on the memory of the clothes I would usually wear, then used my Material Creation.</p>
<p>"Ha, this ability is quite useful since I can even make my own clothes now."</p>
<p>All dressed up, I decided to a explore a bit, but despite walking for hours I saw nothing but an endless desert.</p>
<p>"Where is this place and why was I sent here? Could it have been those Olympian or Egyptian Gods? That shouldn't be the case since we just came to an agreement. Then a third party? If they meant me harm, they could probably have done much worse. Just what is the meaning behind this? Also why is it the exact same place as the hologram which Lena was projecting?"</p>
<p>Dozens of thoughts were racing through my mind, but I couldn't arrive at any conclusion, until finally dawn had arrived.</p>
<p>"What? There are two suns...?"</p>
<p>In the horizon there were two suns climbing into the sky. It was like when you fried an egg and realized it had two yolks. Soaring into the heavens, the first was red, but the second was a blue sun and was twice as bright.</p>
<p>"A desert with two suns, Is this heat the reason that there is no life on this planet?"</p>
<p>I still had no idea as to why I had been brought here, so I was becoming ever more curious about the area.</p>
<p>"Well, I still have about 40 hours until I can leave, why don't we explore a bit more?"</p>
<p>I ran for about four hours straight, but the desert hadn't changed in the slightest.</p>
<p>"Is it truly and endless desert? I think I've travelled more than 1,000 km... cough** cough***"</p>
<p>I can just run into to a sandstorm with winds upwards of 200~300 km/h.</p>
<p>"Ugh, I have sand in my mouth. Now i'm thirsty."</p>
<p>I look around once more, but seeing nothing but desert, I choose to create my own water.</p>
<p>"Hey... is that something over there on the horizon?"</p>
<p>I knew it might be a mirage, but I had little else to do so I chose to check it out. I ran for another four hours towards the supposed mirage, but the distance never seems to shorten.</p>
<p>"Damn, so it really was a mirage in the end? It must be since the distance never seemed to change."</p>
<p>Stubbornly I chose to continue, and after another three hours of travel I came upon a set of enormous stones, shaped to look like an arched gate.</p>
<p>"So it wasn't a mirage... but are they just regular stones?"</p>
<p>Frustrated, I sat down on the desert sand.</p>
<p>"Shit... my stomach is grumbling and my throat is parched. Sure I can make my own water, but without Lena's guidance I can't yet create food. Although I'm now a God and won't die of hunger, my stomach would grumble just the same as when I was a mortal!"</p>
<p>Lying down on the sand, I materialize myself some water to drink.</p>
<p>"Damn, I don't want to be stuck here, I'm hungry and tired!"</p>
<p>Also the temperatures were quite extreme in the desert. As one would expect, during the day, especially with two suns it would be quite quite hot, but as the night went down the temperature would drop to surprisingly cold levels.</p>
<p>"Brrrr! Should I make myself a bonfire?"</p>
<p>Trembling in the sand, I decide to create myself some timber to burn and warm myself by the fire.</p>
<p>"Ah, this feels great."</p>
<p>I poured some methanol on the fire which I had just started up.</p>
<p>Harrrrrrr</p>
<p>"Ah~ feels good to be warm. It would also be nice to have ourselves a barbecue."</p>
<p>I spoke to myself as I rubbed my hand and kept them close to the fire.</p>
<p>Squeak!</p>
<p>"What was that sound?"</p>
<p>It was sounded quite familiar, like that of the Tomb Rat which was the first monster I had hunted when I crossed over. Turning my head, I found the owner of the sound.</p>
<p>"Waaah!"</p>
<p>I screamed in surprise.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 125</p>
<p>Squeak! Squeak!</p>
<p>There were an incredible number of rats standing up on their hind legs, just a few meters away from me. No, they weren't just regular rats as they each held some kind of weapon, be it a sword, shield or bow.</p>
<p>"What's going on? Is this revenge for all the rat's I've killed in my lifetime?"</p>
<p>I tried to reach out to Lena.</p>
<p>"Lena! Quickly prepare the Rohim's shield!"</p>
<p>'Hm... thousands, no, tens of thousands of rats swarmed around me. Just where had they all come from?'</p>
<p>Unfortunately Lena didn't heed my call, no doubt being too absorbed in her calculations to notice the current situation.</p>
<p>"Damn, what bad timing, Thanatos! Gnoss!"</p>
<p>I tried calling the other two, but there was likewise no response.</p>
<p>'Geez, why is it that no one shows up in my time of need?'</p>
<p>Fortunately the Ratmen (I had arbitrarily decided to name them so) kept there distance and didn't seem to be in any particular hurry. I would occasionally hear a squeak or two, but considering their numbers, they were indeed quite disciplined.</p>
<p>After about an hour or so of such a stand off, I was beginning to become a bit impatient and doubtful as to what their intentions were.</p>
<p>'Why aren't they attacking? Quickly fight me so that I can release my flames upon you. I'm a bit worried that you'd all run away were I to take the initiative. '</p>
<p>Suddenly, from far out I heard a disturbance.</p>
<p>Squeak! Squeak!</p>
<p>The army of rats made way as if Moses himself had parted the Red Sea. A little rat girl, about one meter tall with pink fur as opposed to the black fur on all the other rats, made her way towards me.</p>
<p>'It seems that in their tribe the females enjoy a lot of power. '</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>The pink rat girl which had been running towards me tripped on herself and landed face first into the sand, just ten meters away from me.</p>
<p>Squeak! Squeak!</p>
<p>It was clear that they were laughing in their own way. Although some of the elder ones elbowed their noisy neighbors, it still took some time for the laughter to quiet down.</p>
<p>The female rat looked around, her face turning red.</p>
<p>'What should I do?'</p>
<p>Picking herself up, she walked before me and bowed down when she was about two meters away.</p>
<p>'Welcome Savior!"</p>
<p>"Savior...?"</p>
<p>"Ah! Didn't you hit your head while you were summoned? Did you lose your memory? Surely Sha sent the right Savior right?"</p>
<p>"Can you understand my words? Just who are you?"</p>
<p>"Ah, forgive me for my latte introduction. I am the eldest among God's children, Evelysla, and I have the ability to communicate in any language."</p>
<p>"Evelysla?"</p>
<p>I had heard that name somewhere, but I was now focused on the other thing she mentioned, which gave me a bad premonition.</p>
<p>"God's children? Who is Sha? Just what are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Oh... did Sha not mention this to you? She was supposed to explain the situation well. Wait, knowing Sha she probably half-assed it, no wonder she always gets scolded by L."</p>
<p>"Wait, Sha? L? Are they the Gods of omniscience and omnipotence?"</p>
<p>She shook her head.</p>
<p>'The Almighty God created several universes and scattered them across the dimensions using his tremendous might.</p>
<p>Sha and L are children of the Almighty himself.</p>
<p>"What, then they haven't been around since the beginning? "</p>
<p>"You have some interesting questions.... anyways, since Sha didn't explain it to you, I'll go ahead and do it. From that door behind you, Abaddon, the eldest daughter from Sha and L, will come back return and seek to put an end to all the universes.</p>
<p>"Behind me? The gate made of stones?"</p>
<p>I asked as I pointed at the arched gate.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Hmm... that's quite the tale, let's start with something simple, where are we?"</p>
<p>"This place is known as Eden, the birthplace of life."</p>
<p>"Eden?"</p>
<p>"Right, it was where Sha and L were created."</p>
<p>"Uh... it sounds like quite the biblical myth, didn't you previously mention that Abaddon was the eldest daughter of Sha and L?"</p>
<p>Evelysla nodded her head.</p>
<p>"Ok, then why is it that Abaddon wants to destroy all the universes.</p>
<p>"I heard that it was because he wanted to monopolize the love of Sha and L. She can't accept sharing her parents affection with other beings."</p>
<p>"How childish, but why don't her parents interfere?"</p>
<p>"At the end of the day she is their daughter. Also, If they were to fight directly it could result in the end of the universes."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Sorry, those are all the details I know."</p>
<p>"Are you saying that's it? Then why is it that you are calling me Savior?"</p>
<p>"We need to exile him back into the Void, and I heard only Savior could do so."</p>
<p>"Oh, then was it you who summoned me here?"</p>
<p>"Right, I did so under the instructions of Sha"</p>
<p>"Where is Sha now?"</p>
<p>"She ran away because if she were to meet Abaddon, it could bring about the destruction of the universe."</p>
<p>"So I need to stop the end of the universe and fix this problematic family? Is that the reason you summoned me here?"</p>
<p>"Right! You caught on so quickly, Savior!"</p>
<p>"Let's get two things straight. First, my name's Johra, not Savior."</p>
<p>"Yes, Savior Johra."</p>
<p>"Just Johra, drop the Savior part, I have no desire to partake in any of this."</p>
<p>"But if Johra doesn't interfere then won't all the universe come to an end?"</p>
<p>"That's not my doing, why don't you try talking to Abaddon. And second, return me immediately to where you summoned me from, you got the wrong guy, understood? That's all I had to say, if you guys don't comply I'll make you pay dearly for it."</p>
<p>Upon hearing what I said Evelysla began to tear up.</p>
<p>"Why are you crying? Do you really think it will make me change my mind?"</p>
<p>"No... it's just that if Johra wasn't the right summon, then the lives of the 10,000 clansmen we sacrificed to teleport you over were wasted for nothing. Please allow me a moment to mourn the meaningless death of m people."</p>
<p>"What! That many deaths just to summon me?"</p>
<p>"It was less that expected to summon a God. Everyone on them volunteered valiantly believing that they were doing their part in saving the universe."</p>
<p>I crossed my arms and frowned.</p>
<p>"How is it that you managed to sacrifice 10,000 lives, but summon the wrong person?"</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, I need to first talk with my people. Later we will consult with Sha and let you know the result.</p>
<p>"Can you truly speak with Sha?"</p>
<p>"Sometimes she will respond, but never a conversation. After all, they are our creators.</p>
<p>Going back among the rats, she huddled up and began conversing with some of the larger ones. All the rats which had previously been standing at attention , fell down to the ground and wept.</p>
<p>'Hm... although I don't feel like I've done anything wrong, the thought of so many lives having been sacrificed on my account is still quite the heavy burden to bear. '</p>
<p>This period of mourning lasted for about 30 minutes and was quite touching. After that, Evelysla returned towards me.</p>
<p>'I learned that we can send you back by sacrificing 30,000 lives. '</p>
<p>"What? 30,000... is that a joke?"</p>
<p>"It's our fault for mistakenly summoning you here, so we have to take responsibility."</p>
<p>"Hold on one second."</p>
<p>'Is this some kind of trap? What would happen if I truly accepted to leave under such conditions? Can I really accept the ticket price of 30,000 lives? Damn, I don't know what's the best choice to make!'</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 126</p>
<p>After a long period of reflection, I opened my eyes and asked Evelysla.</p>
<p>"When will Abaddon appear?"</p>
<p>"In four days time."</p>
<p>"Four days? So after three Sunrises and Sunsets?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Shit! Tell everyone to back off 100 meters!"</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>She jumped up to it and her short little legs shuffled away as she herded her people away form the gate.</p>
<p>"Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I hurriedly recreated all the necessary parts right there and then on the desert sand.</p>
<p>"Hmm... it was a bit rushed."</p>
<p>After about 12 hours I had finished assembling all the parts and my Hyper-Extinction gun had once again seen the light, pointing directly at the arched gate.</p>
<p>"Let's see if I can create that one as well."</p>
<p>"Material Creation!"</p>
<p>A large hammer appeared in my hand.</p>
<p>"It's a bit crude, but it should do the trick. Evelysla, bring forth your strongest clansman."</p>
<p>"Got it!"</p>
<p>Shortly after she led a rather large ratman out of the crowd and brought him before me.</p>
<p>"Hmm... seems about right, he indeed looks quite sturdy."</p>
<p>"Odin is the strongest of us all!"</p>
<p>'Odin is it... could it just be a coincidence that they have the same name?'</p>
<p>"Here, take this."</p>
<p>I handed him the hammer, and as soon as he picked it up he seemed to become excited, unti....</p>
<p>Paaazik!</p>
<p>A lightning bolt fell from the sky and struck the hammer.</p>
<p>Squeak! Squeak!</p>
<p>Odin was terrified and dropped the hammer, while Evelysla placed her hands on her ears and flattened herself against the sand.</p>
<p>"Well at least it seems to be working fine."</p>
<p>The ratman Odin proved that he was quite brave as he picked the hammer back up once more and bowed towards me cordially.</p>
<p>"You are quite well mannered, I will give this to you."</p>
<p>"No way, I can't accept such a divine weapon."</p>
<p>"In order to summon me your people had to pay a terrible price, you can think of this as some small compensation."</p>
<p>"Yes... thank you" Evelysla translated my words to the ratman Odin and he once again gave a deep bow.</p>
<p>"It's a fair price so you can pick yourself up with dignity," said Evelysla, but he continued to prostrate himself before me with his face in the sand.</p>
<p>"Ah... well that's that, Evelysla come with me."</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>I brought her to the control seat of the large gun and hoisted her up her up onto it.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Here is where you sit to control the gun. You press this button to shoot, and after a 10 second delay, the projectile will be fired. Also it can only be fired three times. If it passes that threshold it will likely overheat and explode so make sure to make those three shots count."</p>
<p>"Will this be enough to stop him?"</p>
<p>"I can't answer that for you, but I've done all I can. With that hammer and this gun, you should be able to find a way. I've supported you to the best of my abilities, so I'll be on my way now."</p>
<p>"Thank you God! We will do our best, so you can go back without worrying about the sacrifice involved."</p>
<p>"No, I won't be going through with that, the price is far too high. You just need to use what I gave you and fight off this Abaddon character to save the universe. Oh and when you fire the gun, immediately press this yellow button over here which will create a shield around the gate. Make sure not to forget to create the shield or else you'd be caught in the blast zone.</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>"Good, then don't follow me from now on, okay?"</p>
<p>She nodded back and then prostrated herself on the ground.</p>
<p>"I'm going now," I said as I turned around and walked out into the desert.</p>
<p>"Dammit! I've done all I can so I really need to stop feeling guilty about it!"</p>
<p>I was once again surrounded by endless desert, with nothing in sight after half a day of walking and trying not to look back.</p>
<p>"This should be far enough right? Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created myself a parasol and a small swimming pool, my own paradise within this unforgiving desert.</p>
<p>"Might as well relax here until Lena is done with her calculations."</p>
<p>I cooled of for a little while, then climbed out and fashioned myself a simple bed under the parasol which I used to take a well deserved nap.</p>
<p>"Johra, Johra! Oh my God!"</p>
<p>I was awakened by Lena's excited shouts just as the suns were setting and the cold crept in.</p>
<p>"So you're back Lena... but next time don't immerse yourself so much in your work to the exclusion of all else."</p>
<p>"Sorry about that, I thought I'd be fine since there weren't any signs of life nearby and saw that the calculations would be very difficult."</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>"So... do you know where we are now?"</p>
<p>"Uhm... wasn't that your job to find out?"</p>
<p>" By studying the positioning of stars and movement of cosmic forces, I've realized that we've returned 20 million years in the past, to when the universe is only 100,000 years old."</p>
<p>"Are you serious... 20 million years? Damn."</p>
<p>I was expecting something like this after learning form Evelysla that this place had been the origin of life, but still never imagined we had gone back so far.</p>
<p>I looked up to see the stars in the night sky.</p>
<p>"Is this around the time that the constellations begin forming? They don't look all that different from 20 million years from now."</p>
<p>"What do you mean? Being able to witness these young stars which will go on to become the cornerstones of the known universe, there are no words to express such joy."</p>
<p>"Lena you sound quite human sometimes with the things you say."</p>
<p>"Haha I am a well made AI"</p>
<p>"Anyway, did you manage to find a way to go back?"</p>
<p>"Well..."</p>
<p>"Where you not able to find anything out?"</p>
<p>"There was this one clue."</p>
<p>"What clue?"</p>
<p>"It was the Ratmen who summoned you right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"They can then send you back."</p>
<p>"That would be pointless though, in order to do that they would need to sacrifice 30,000 lives."</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten that I'm the best at calculation and adjusting for time dilation. If I use Johra's new magic stone it could replace their sacrifices."</p>
<p>"Oh, then should I go back and see them?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but when you head back, instead of walking, create this."</p>
<p>Lena projected some schematics before me.</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"It's a small personal helicopter. The rotor blades on each side have enough force to allow you to hover above the ground and they can easily be manipulated to turn in any direction."</p>
<p>"Sounds like fun, should I make it now?"</p>
<p>After about 30 minutes work, I climbed unto my very own futuristic hovercraft.</p>
<p>Buuu! Buuuu—-!</p>
<p>I was able to hover about 30 meters above ground, raising up a huge cloud of sand.</p>
<p>"What's the direction?"</p>
<p>"I'll project it directly to your cornea."</p>
<p>"Thanks Lena."</p>
<p>After about one hour I once again met up with the clan of ratmen.</p>
<p>I saw Evelysla notice my arrival and she hopped her way towards me.</p>
<p>"How Clumsy" I said to myself with a smile.</p>
<p>"I had a feeling that you wouldn't dislike her."</p>
<p>"What are you saying Lena... that I'm into rats?"</p>
<p>"You're not at all convincing with that silly grin."</p>
<p>"Ridiculous."</p>
<p>I promptly questioned Evelysla about the summoning magic.</p>
<p>"Although the magic circle has disappeared, I should be able to reproduce it form memory."</p>
<p>"Oh, then can you set it up at our very feet?"</p>
<p>Evelysla then proceeded to draw a large, 10 meter array.</p>
<p>"Awesome!"</p>
<p>"You have no idea, with this we can adjust for any time dilation. Afterall, any mistake would mean that we miss our target date by million of years. Incredible that so much information can be compressed into a 2D array, this by far outpaces any data compression methods we have."</p>
<p>"Lena, focus."</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>
<p>"God, who is it that you are talking to?"</p>
<p>"My assistant."</p>
<p>She wasn't able to hear Lena's voice since she only spoke to me through vibration in my jaw bones.</p>
<p>After about 10 hours of analysis, Lena shouted out.</p>
<p>"Eureka! I should be able to replicate the design and incorporate it into a 3D array which would make use of your magic stones. However it isn't possible to account for all kinds of radiation."</p>
<p>"What does that mean?"</p>
<p>"Just that in the construction, perfection can't be achieved.</p>
<p>"So there might be some mistakes?"</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"How big is the margin of error?"</p>
<p>"About 0. 00001%."</p>
<p>"And that translates two how much time?"</p>
<p>"More or less twenty years."</p>
<p>"Ugh...."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but groan, that would mean that in the worst case scenario I might arrive too late to save Valenor.</p>
<p>"If we return and don't like the result, can we time travel once more?"</p>
<p>"That would be difficult since tearing the fabric of time and space affects the integrity of the entire universe. Doing it twice in a row would be pushing it."</p>
<p>"I see, we'll cross that bridge when we get to it. For now get it set up to launch, Lena."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll need about 12 hours."</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>There were still about 16 hours until Abaddon would make her appearance, so while we were cutting it a bit close, as soon as Lena had completed the array we could leave immediately, so it should be fine.</p>
<p>Of course that was just some wishful thinking on my part.</p>
<p>"Savior, the ability of that hammer you created is really impressive. With it Odin can create lighting, summon a thunderstorm or even disappear in a flash."</p>
<p>"Oh, well it's nothing special since I had already known it would perform that way. Where is Odin now?"</p>
<p>"He is currently travelling back to our village and returning with some necessary supplies for the upcoming battle. While he holds that godly weapon he is so powerful and quick that it seems that there is nothing he can't do."</p>
<p>"Hmm...."</p>
<p>I was secretly impressed with the abilities of Mjölnir which Odin had designed. It was even compatible with a regular Ratman, enabling him to wield a God's power.</p>
<p>"Okay, then before I leave I'll give you an even better weapon."</p>
<p>"Truly?"</p>
<p>"Ah don't get too excited, it'll just be so-so. I'll be going now to focus on the production of the weapon."</p>
<p>I ran away from her while knocking myself in the head.</p>
<p>"Shit! Why was it that I suddenly made her such a promise? How could I possibly make something which exceeds Mjölnir?"</p>
<p>After wracking my brains for over three hours, I finally decided on attempting to recreate the most powerful weapon I had ever held.</p>
<p>"Material Creation!"</p>
<p>After successfully casting over 1,000 times, a large pearl white sword was finalized.</p>
<p>"So I've managed to make a replica of Excalibur."</p>
<p>Excalibur itself was just like Mjölnir in that it acted as an amplifier of one's power. However it was slightly superior to the hammer in that it had the ability to ignore all defense.</p>
<p>Shhhuwuuu!</p>
<p>I gave it a test run as I chopped down in mid air. As it reached the ground, it disintegrated any sand it came into contact with.</p>
<p>"Hmm... this might be a bit too powerful."</p>
<p>After a period of reflection, I decided to add a limiter to it.</p>
<p>"Was it like this that Odin added a limiter? No, since I'll be giving them the sword forever essentially I should put a time limit on it. So changing this, and that... good, all done."</p>
<p>I beckoned Evelysla who had been watching curiously from afar this whole time.</p>
<p>"Are you finished your work, Savior? Is that the sword? It looks awesome!"</p>
<p>"Ah... well it's just a regular sword."</p>
<p>"What is it called?"</p>
<p>"Excalibur, here take it."</p>
<p>"I shall give it to the greatest swordsman in my clan, is that okay?"</p>
<p>"Sure, bring him over."</p>
<p>"Oberon has great skill with a sword. True, he is also good with a bow, but his swordplay is exceptional."</p>
<p>"Oberon? That name is familiar. Who knows, next you'll be introducing people like Thor and Zeus, right?"</p>
<p>I said as I handed her Excalibur.</p>
<p>"How did you know the name of our clan elders? No wonder you are the all powerful Savior!"</p>
<p>"Ah... Wait.... This...can it truly be?"</p>
<p>I sank into deep thought.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 127</p>
<p>The pieces of the puzzle were beginning to fall into place in my mind.</p>
<p>Sha and L, the first gods and creators of all life.</p>
<p>Any lifeform had the possibility to evolve. I had learned through my past experiences that gathering Divine Grace can lead to evolution, allowing a species to break free from certain genetic limits.</p>
<p>These ratmen before shared the same names as the High Gods some 20 million years from now. It wouldn't be a stretch to think that they would indeed eventually become these fearsome powers. In fact, this was highly probable considering that they all shared the same names.</p>
<p>'How troublesome... if my thinking is correct, then any action I take could influence the future. '</p>
<p>Like my creating Mjölnir or handing over Excalibur... wait. '</p>
<p>A strange thought had occurred to me.</p>
<p>'What if I was the creator of those items all along. Could it be that I wa the one that handed Excalibur to the Fairy King?'</p>
<p>Until this point I had been completely convinced that Odin had been Mjölnir's creator, but what if it had been me all along?</p>
<p>But this was all a bit problematic. I was only able to create Mjölnir because I had previously seen it, so who was its original creator?</p>
<p>'What a strange contradiction, is it possible for me to at the same time be a forger and its original creator? Time has a funny way of playing tricks on you. '</p>
<p>Countless thoughts were racing through my mind as I attempted to extrapolate every possibility, until it was all a bit too much to handle.</p>
<p>"Sigh~ I guess it's possible."</p>
<p>"What do you mean, Savior?"</p>
<p>"No, nothing I was just thinking out loud."</p>
<p>"You seem to think things through quite extensively. It's totally the opposite personality of Sha and L, they are impulsive and act first, then deal with the aftermath of their decisions. '"</p>
<p>"Well... I've had some unique life experiences which have made me so cautious."</p>
<p>"I rather like this pensive personality of yours."</p>
<p>"Why is that? Do you think I'm unlike a regular God due to my indecisiveness?"</p>
<p>Evelysla shook her head vigorously.</p>
<p>"I think that the fact that you understand the pain of us mortals, means that you will make this world a better place."</p>
<p>"Do you truly believe that?"</p>
<p>'It's beyond belief, I will support you, always and forever. '</p>
<p>"Stop that, don't spray my face with too much gold." (TL: Korean expression which means to shower with praise. )</p>
<p>"What is this thing called gold?"</p>
<p>Evelysla asked while staring at me curiously.</p>
<p>"It is a bright and shiny yellow metal which can be dug from the ground and is quite rare and expensive. If one were to put gold on someone's face it would become quite shiny, so putting too much gold on one's face is like excessive flattery."</p>
<p>"Oh, so this gold thing is precious?"</p>
<p>I groaned inwardly. By introducing gold in that manner, I had let my biases affect how gold would be perceived for eons to come.</p>
<p>'I really need to be more careful... it's far too easy to affect the future right now. '</p>
<p>It was then that I vowed to never again play with the dangers of time.</p>
<p>Chiiiizzzzzzi Biuuuuuu Paat</p>
<p>Out of nowhere the magic circle around the arched stone gate began to shine brilliantly.</p>
<p>"Could it be?"</p>
<p>'No way! Is she arriving already? She's too early!'</p>
<p>Evelysla ran to position herself behind the Hyper-Extinction gun while the rest of the ratmen prepared themselves for battle, facing the Doomsday Gate. I went and stand near Evelysla.</p>
<p>"Can't we just blow of the stone gate?"</p>
<p>'Sha said that it acts more of a marker and that destroying the gate wouldn't delay her return. '</p>
<p>"I guess it would be too simple of a solution."</p>
<p>The magic circle had started of with a faint glow, but as time passed more complex patterns began lighting up.</p>
<p>"Isn't there any way to stop the process?"</p>
<p>"It is said that Abaddon's magical prowess is beyond that of Sha and L, so there is no one who can stop her."</p>
<p>"So her magic is superior... just how is this Abaddon fellow so powerful?"</p>
<p>"Sha said that in the whole universe, she is the most beautiful, powerful and deadly being."</p>
<p>"What, why aren't some of those contradictory?"</p>
<p>"I think Abaddon inherited both Sha and L's good and bad parts."</p>
<p>"It seems that according to this Sha and L are also quite problematic."</p>
<p>Heehee... I probably shouldn't inform Sha and L that you said that. No, if it's them they probably already know about it."</p>
<p>"How could they know?"</p>
<p>"L has the ability to see and hear things, regardless of distance If he so chooses."</p>
<p>"Oh, that's truly creepy."</p>
<p>"You think so? Anyway they are excellent Gods."</p>
<p>"That isn't really my concern though, I'm more worried about the fact that Abaddon has returned before I could transfer out."</p>
<p>I began running some calculations in my mind.</p>
<p>'If Abaddon's strength is enough to receive the acknowledgement form Sha and L then these ratmen alone don't have the required strength to defeat her, regardless of the gifts I've given them. If I were to leave them for dead, wouldn't the future be severely impacted? Still, what if me staying behind and successfully stopping Abaddon is what changed the flow of time, perhaps just the fact that I was summoned back here had already had too big of an impact. When I return to the future it could have already changed dramatically. Across a time shift of 20 million years, due to the butterfly effect, any minute change could result in drastic consequences. Just what is the right choice?'</p>
<p>After overthinking things for so long, I shook my head in an attempt to clear my thoughts.</p>
<p>"Why did you do that?"</p>
<p>"I have too much on my mind right now."</p>
<p>"Are you worried for my people, you don't need to do that, you've done enough. You have your own life to return to, so you can go knowing that we will fight to the best of our abilities. As long as you remember our sacrifice, that's enough."</p>
<p>Our species were different, but the resolute look in her eyes was able to move me.</p>
<p>"Yes, since I don't know what would happen in either case, I'll simply follow my heart."</p>
<p>"Lena?"</p>
<p>"Here! The progress on the calculations is at 80%."</p>
<p>"Ok, good, now leave it running as a secondary task."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"Did you not hear me? Don't allocate more than 3% of your processing power to it."</p>
<p>"Understood! But in that case it would take more that a week to complete."</p>
<p>"I'm aware."</p>
<p>"So you've chosen to fight?"</p>
<p>"Yes, let's brainstorm to find a way to stop an enemy which is the most proficient in magic. Give me any solutions you can think of."</p>
<p>Ever since that Doomsday Gate was lit, I was hard at work with preparations. Along with Lena's help I created a wide variety of traps combining the Rohim's Shield and and complex 3D magic arrays which would stop time itself. In that short amount of time, Lena and I had completely exhausted our knowledge and pulled out all the stops.</p>
<p>"Ha... so this is what we can achieve if we go all out?"</p>
<p>"Great Savior! What are those things?"</p>
<p>I had instructed the ratmen to back off 200 meters while I worked on the traps, but Evelysla had shadowed me the entire time, curious as to what I was doing. She would even help me sometimes by wiping this sweat off my brow. This rat girl was beginning to look cuter and cuter by the second.</p>
<p>'I have to stop thinking like that, she's a rat!'</p>
<p>I tried to change my thinking, but the mind worked in mysterious ways and it isn't easy to influence one's own thoughts.</p>
<p>Zzzzing</p>
<p>Finally the magic circle had been completed and space cracks began to appear within in it.</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>A large number of creatures appeared from the bright light, followed by a booming telepathic message.</p>
<p>'Are there those that dare block my way!'</p>
<p>The message rang imposingly through the minds of the ratmen, immediately bringing them to their knees.</p>
<p>An enormous entity appeared in a blinding red light. It was so bright that I had difficulty seeing the creature properly.</p>
<p>"Ho ho, are these the life forms which Sha and L created?"</p>
<p>It was a voice which I was more than familiar with.</p>
<p>"What? Could it really be...."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 128</p>
<p>"Lilinor! What are you doing over here?"</p>
<p>The dragon which I suspected to be Lilinor turned its head towards me inquisitively.</p>
<p>"Lilinor? Never heard that name. Are these crude traps your doing? They couldn't possibly be the work of these ratmen."</p>
<p>The dragon known as Abaddon crushed the traps before her with a swish of her tail.</p>
<p>'Hmm, although she looks similar to Lilinor, she's much stronger. '</p>
<p>"Evelysla, shoot!"</p>
<p>"Got it!"</p>
<p>Zzziiiiing</p>
<p>As soon as she pressed the trigger, a light began to form at the end of the gun.</p>
<p>"Everyone close your eyes!"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>Spppat, Quaaaaa</p>
<p>In the next moment, the Hyper-Extinction gun fired and hit Abaddon's group.</p>
<p>"Lena!"</p>
<p>I've set up our strongest shields, the aftershocks should en in 30 seconds, 29... done!</p>
<p>After a short time all light disappeared and only a pitch black sphere remained floating in mid-air.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it's an ensemble of miniature black holes which have surpassed a critical mass."</p>
<p>Lena did her best to explain the situation, but it was at best just a theory.</p>
<p>"Well I've got a bad feeling about this, get ready to hit them once more, Evelysla!"</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>The Extinction gun fired once more.</p>
<p>"We've created another crater."</p>
<p>When the dust resulting from the second shot cleared, a shadow began to form.</p>
<p>"Was it not effective?"</p>
<p>Swooosh!</p>
<p>A claw emerged from the black sphere, followed by the rest of the dragon Abaddon's body.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is much more interesting than I expected! Should I change my mind? No wonder Sha and L summoned you here. HAHAHA!"</p>
<p>Abaddon booming laughter assaulted our ears.</p>
<p>"Ugh... this guy is really noisy."</p>
<p>As I was grumbling to myself, two lightning fast shadows made their way towards the imposing dragon.</p>
<p>Zzzhaa, Quaaaaaa! Phaazz</p>
<p>Odin's Mjölnir and Oberon's Excalibur both left a mark on dragon claw.</p>
<p>"Even these weapons are exceptional, is it also your work?"</p>
<p>Abaddon asked me with a relaxed smile.</p>
<p>"Don't get too comfortable! Lena, hit it!"</p>
<p>"Yep!"</p>
<p>The spacetime trap which I had hidden amongst the others was instantly activated. Even if he had a monstrous magic ability, it wouldn't be effective when caught inside this array, so I felt I had finally achieved something.</p>
<p>'Oh, have you confined me to a trap based on time?'</p>
<p>Abaddon's body which remained frozen inside the array, was able to communicate with me telepathically.</p>
<p>"Damn, so it doesn't fully restrict him."</p>
<p>I couldn't help but let out a groan as I witnessed him rolling his eyes in a mocking expression.</p>
<p>'Well I'll admit that you were able to restrict me somewhat, but my servants have already passed through into this universe, so my end goal will be achieved. '</p>
<p>"Your minions, what about them?"</p>
<p>I pointed to the dragon-like creatures which had been trapped in mid-air.</p>
<p>"Are you saying that you prepared more than one of these traps?"</p>
<p>"Naturally since I knew that you wouldn't be coming alone, I kept some hidden cards."</p>
<p>'Kukuku... you indeed prepared thoroughly, but there is one thing that you overlooked. '</p>
<p>"What's that?"</p>
<p>"The time period that this trap can hold me is quite short."</p>
<p>"True, but the time it take to set up a new trap around you is shorter than the time it takes you to break out, so I can do this indefinitely. Lena?"</p>
<p>"On it!"</p>
<p>"I raised my hand and created a magic stone out of thin air. Then, along with Lena's assistance I set up a new trap to go off as soon as the other expired.</p>
<p>"What do you think? It took 2 minutes and 40 seconds to set up, but how long does it take you to break free?"</p>
<p>"Dammit! You're cheating!"</p>
<p>I shook my head and responded with a silly expression.</p>
<p>"In war there is no right and wrong, only the victors."</p>
<p>"I now know why Sha and L summoned you here, you're my natural nemesis."</p>
<p>"Natural nemesis?"</p>
<p>"A person who can wield a wide array of skills can occasionally suppress a user like myself who focuses on only the most powerful magic like myself. They must have called you back form the future."</p>
<p>"Was it like that? In fact it wasn't even my original intention to interfere. I just couldn't bear to see you bully a young lady like her."</p>
<p>I said as I stroked Evelysla's head.</p>
<p>The next second Abaddon's expression changed into a mischievous smile.</p>
<p>"Well have you had fun with this little game of yours?"</p>
<p>She suddenly reappeared outside of the array.</p>
<p>"How?"</p>
<p>"One's eyes are easily deceived, I simply showed you want you wished to see. Did you enjoy the show?"</p>
<p>Abaddon huge body flicker with unmatched speed until her jaws appeared just 3 meters before me.</p>
<p>"Damn you Abaddon!"</p>
<p>I hid Evelysla behind me and stood up proudly.</p>
<p>Shwaaa Quaaaa</p>
<p>"I allowed it you to harm me once, but there won't be a second time!"</p>
<p>Abaddon swatted Odin and Oberon away like flies.</p>
<p>"You are interesting though, at first I planned on destroying the universe, but if there is an fascinating guy like you around it might be worth sparing. Perhaps I can enjoy the show a little longer."</p>
<p>Dozens of thoughts raced through my mind as I tried to find a solution. It seemed to be willing to put off the destruction of the entire universe on a mere whim, then why not up the stakes and make it truly interesting.</p>
<p>"Abaddon, is the destruction of the universe just a game to you?"</p>
<p>I asked in a reproachful tone.</p>
<p>"Right, this space created by Sha and L is irksome and their lifeforms are boring so I was going to erase it."</p>
<p>"Why is that, are you jealous of Sha and L?"</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha! Me! Jealous of them? Ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>"Aren't Sha and L stronger than you?"</p>
<p>"They're stronger than me? Ha ha ha! Where are they then? I've just returned but the've fled with their tail between their legs. They're afraid of me."</p>
<p>"Why would they be afraid of you, aren't they your parents?"</p>
<p>"What... my parents?"</p>
<p>Abaddon stared at me dangerously.</p>
<p>"Is that not the case?"</p>
<p>I asked, carefully testing the waters.</p>
<p>"My parents were the most powerful beings in all the universes, Omniscience and Omnipotence. Those twisted Sha and L attempted to steal their powers but failed to make it their own and in the end I inherited it. Ha ha... Sha and L being my parents, what a joke!"</p>
<p>Her angry laughter was so loud it threatened to burst my eardrums.</p>
<p>"Okay, okay, lower your voice I'm willing to hear your version of the story, Abaddon."</p>
<p>"Why would I care about that when I'll soon be destroying this entire place?"</p>
<p>"Because before you do I'll show you something interesting."</p>
<p>"What could you possibly amuse me with, I who has inherited such almighty powers?"</p>
<p>I stared at him directly in the eyes.</p>
<p>"Quit your lies, you are neither as omniscient nor omnipotent as you might claim to be, else I wouldn't be able to stand against you."</p>
<p>Abaddon peered at me with great interest.</p>
<p>"Okay, for argument's sake let's agree that what you said is true. I can still easily destroy this entire universe, doesn't that mean that I'm all powerful?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"If you were truly the Almighty then you'd be able to create something larger and better than all this. To destroy is easy, but to create is far more difficult."</p>
<p>"Ho ho... that's quite interesting, then why is it that you think that I can't create new things?"</p>
<p>I squirmed in delight, knowing I had him hooked.</p>
<p>"Just wait a moment, Material Creation!"</p>
<p>After a few dozen times I'd made a large rectangular board.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?"</p>
<p>"Just wait a bit, I'm not done yet."</p>
<p>Evelysla and the ratmen held their breaths nervously as they watched me work. Meanwhile Abaddon peered towards me, half suspicious and the other half curious.</p>
<p>"Done!"</p>
<p>"What is that supposed to be?"</p>
<p>I looked towards Abaddon imposingly.</p>
<p>"A tool to prove that you are not omniscient and omnipotence!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 129</p>
<p>"What are you trying to make with a 19×19 board?"</p>
<p>"Just wait a while longer, I'm not done yet. Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created about 400 round and flat black and white rocks.</p>
<p>"Are those black and white stones?"</p>
<p>"I nodded back and replied, If you truly believe yourself to be omnipotent and omniscient then defeat me in this game. If you do, I'll quitely return to whence I came."</p>
<p>"Why do I need to play along?"</p>
<p>Abaddon responded somewhat irritated.</p>
<p>"Two reasons. The first is that I still have a way to stop you, so this would be a better alternative for you."</p>
<p>I signalled Lena to begin and together we created a 3D magic array around her.</p>
<p>"Whoa! What is this array supposed to do?"</p>
<p>"You'd best not make any sudden movements. If you do anything suspicious I'll immediately activate it and send you back 20 million years in the past. That much time should be more than enough for me to prepare some countermeasures."</p>
<p>With a wave of my hand the array began to shine, demonstrating my readiness.</p>
<p>"Stop... stop! Do you also wish to be trapped in this place for the next 20 million years? I know that you come from 20 million years in the future, so if you were to send me back then you would lose your chance to return."</p>
<p>"Why is that? I could just use the same array twice."</p>
<p>"No, spells like these that tamper with time on a large scale cause severe damage to the space time continuum. If you were to use it on me, even if you were by some miracle be able to return to the future, you could never properly calculate the right period due to the severe fluctuations that would occur as a result."</p>
<p>"Well at least the entire universe wouldn't be destroyed, I could figure something out after that."</p>
<p>Although I was pretending to be completely fine with that result, the truth was that Abaddon's words had rattled me. He had a point about tampering with time and its consequences.</p>
<p>"Fine then I understand your first reason, what's the second?"</p>
<p>"It's simple enough, the second reason is that it doesn't cost you anything. If I lose then I'll simply return to the future and you can do as you wish."</p>
<p>"And what if I lose?"</p>
<p>"Well I have to admit that you still have the upperhand in these negotiations, so it'll only be a light penalty."</p>
<p>"What kind of penalty?"</p>
<p>"To not destroy the universe until we play out a rematch."</p>
<p>"Rematch? When will that occur?"</p>
<p>"When we next meet."</p>
<p>I would have 20 million years of preparation, surely in that time I would be able to find a way to defeat her. I also hoped that time would change her and that she wouldn't make trouble in the future.</p>
<p>"Hmm, That's not enough."</p>
<p>"Not enough?"</p>
<p>"This is a duel upon which hinges the fate of the universe, so I'll add another condition to spice it up. Whoever loses will have to give everything they own to the winner. I'll simply trample over you all in victory, and bring you all down to your knees."</p>
<p>Abaddon's eyes radiated with confidence.</p>
<p>"You must truly believe yourself to be omniscient and omnipotent"</p>
<p>"Right, in fact you should already be proud simply by the fact that you've triggered the curiosity of such an almighty God."</p>
<p>'Well, even if one is a God, it doesn't necessarily mean they are omnipotent. '</p>
<p>At this moment, I had perhaps underestimated Abaddon far too much.</p>
<p>"I'll explain the rules of the game."</p>
<p>Abaddon however, shook her head.</p>
<p>"No need, I already know them."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You might have thought that this would be a game that you could best me in, but didn't I tell you already? I've inherited the power of the Almighty himself! Although my ability to see far into the future isn't always accurate, I have a full grasp of anything that occurs in the present. You seem to have an interesting chip on the back of your neck which had the rules to the game."</p>
<p>Gulp!</p>
<p>I couldn't help but swallow down nervously.</p>
<p>I had thought that she couldn't possibly be omnipotent so I had chosen the game of Go. It was one in which A. I. excelled at so I felt that even if it was against a potent God, I should have a chance.</p>
<p>It seemed that this would now be an uphill battle.</p>
<p>'She seems to grasp anything within this universe. '</p>
<p>I took some time to think things through before responding.</p>
<p>"How convenient."</p>
<p>I finally let out, after a long period of silence.</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha~ things not going according to plan? You look quite depressed and your forehead is full of sweat."</p>
<p>"Think what you want. I am just excited to play this game against a similar level player.</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha~! Good, if you're that fired up then perhaps I can enjoy a challenge for the first time in my life."</p>
<p>"But there is one more thing."</p>
<p>"Oh, what is that?"</p>
<p>"I'll start with four stones handicap."</p>
<p>"Hahaha, are you that afraid of my omniscience and omnipotence?</p>
<p>I placed a black stone on each the corners of the 19×19 grid board.</p>
<p>"There is no komi, so you can begin anytime."</p>
<p>(A komi of 6. 5 points is given to the player with the white stones, to offset black's advantage of getting the first move. However since there are handicap stones, then the komi is 0. 5 points. )</p>
<p>Abaddon simply pointed towards and intersection and her white stone moved with a life of its own.</p>
<p>'Hmm... it doesn't seem that she was lying when she claimed to know the rules. '</p>
<p>"I wasn't lying."</p>
<p>I looked up at her in surprise.</p>
<p>"Didn't I tell you? I know everything that happens within this universe."</p>
<p>"Uh...."</p>
<p>We played a few more moves.</p>
<p>Our game which decided the fate of the universe continued, and it was not going favorably for me. Of course Lena helped out, but Abaddon seemed capable of predicting all the outcomes and was fiercely catching up.</p>
<p>I had vastly underestimate Abaddon. Because she reminded me of Lilinor, I thought I could win easily; however after just 150 moves I was already behind by 1 point.</p>
<p>'Wow... despite having 4 stones handicap. '</p>
<p>"Of course, if you'd have placed five stones perhaps the result would have been different, but due to your arrogance you chose only four and any chances of winning flew out the window."</p>
<p>Abaddon replied haughtily. This caused me to be quite frustrated and I developed a dirty strategy as a result.</p>
<p>"Indeed it's as you say, wanting to win against you was my mistake, you are so right."</p>
<p>"Ah?"</p>
<p>Abaddon's expression changed into that of surprise.</p>
<p>"Lena, let's create a triple ko."</p>
<p>(In Go, a ko is a situation where one side captures a stone, but there other side can't immediately capture it back without place a move elsewhere first. There is a rare situation in which the life and death of a group is decided by three different ko. In such a case, black and white will alternate in capturing one of the three ko which can go on forever. This is known as a triple ko and is considered to result in a tie. )</p>
<p>"Let's do this!"</p>
<p>"What are you doing!"</p>
<p>Abaddon shouted loudly.</p>
<p>"This is my answer."</p>
<p>"You are a crazy."</p>
<p>I had managed to create a triple ko, of course that was only possible due to Lena's assistance. It was a situation where neither could back down from this ko, or they'd lose the game.</p>
<p>"That was scary for a second, luckily it worked out in the end."</p>
<p>"Damn!"</p>
<p>We kept capturing each other's stones in the ko, and Abaddon was becoming more and more frustrated.</p>
<p>We kept this up for about 10 years worth of time, a testament to Abaddon's stubbornness. During that time, even Abaddon's subordinates which had had been released from the arrays and had come to watch the game, had grown bored and walked around the village aimlessly.</p>
<p>"Enough! This has become pointless," Abaddon declared.</p>
<p>"Too true, how many times have we been recapturing the same stones?"</p>
<p>"It's been 233,201 times, Johra."</p>
<p>"Lena responded."</p>
<p>"Did you hear that, Abaddon?"</p>
<p>"Shit!"</p>
<p>She helplessly swiped her claws at the desert sand. Despite her overwhelming power, she was still bound to the oath she had made and couldn't go back on her word.</p>
<p>If this continued the result of the game would be a tie, which meant that neither of us had lost.</p>
<p>"You are a crazy!"</p>
<p>"How many times do you have to say that?"</p>
<p>"Fine, I concede. I resign, let's have our rematch!"</p>
<p>I made sported my crooked smile.</p>
<p>'I've succeeded in the end. '</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 130</p>
<p>"Let's start the next match! But, draw isn't allowed anymore."</p>
<p>Abaddon exclaimed with a more serious expression, but I answered with a cheeky smile.</p>
<p>"What are you talking about Abaddon? Didn't you just admit to losing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, so let's quickly start the next match."</p>
<p>"Have you already forgotten your promise? Didn't we agree that the winner would obtain everything from the loser?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but didn't you agree to play again?"</p>
<p>I shook my head and spoke arrogantly.</p>
<p>"I hadn't agreed to that. from now on everything that was yours is now mine, right?"</p>
<p>Abaddon replied with a frown, "you're right."</p>
<p>I figured that she had never lost any bet in her life. That's why she had no idea how to react in such a situation.</p>
<p>"It's as you said, everything has become mine, then doesn't that include you as well, Abaddon?"</p>
<p>She stared at me with eyes full of hate. It was only now that she realized the trap which she had walked into. Perhaps she had never ever expected to lose, so she was now a bit panicked.</p>
<p>"So what you're saying is that now that everything that was mine is all yours and that you won't accept a rematch?"</p>
<p>She asked testily, clearly having difficulty controlling her temper.</p>
<p>"No, naturally all three promises must be upheld. You completely belong to me, the universe won't be destroyed and our promised battle will occur when we next meet. What do you think?"</p>
<p>"It's.... It's as you said. So when will we meet again?"</p>
<p>"Oh, I'm planning on returning to my own life, so I supposed it would be then."</p>
<p>Abaddon stared at be wide eyed.</p>
<p>"Your name was Johra right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'm Johra, the God of Creation."</p>
<p>"Hm... I'll remember that. Then before we next meet, I have something to impart to you."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I am all powerful in this universe, but even I can't affect time. What you are doing, moving around in the space time continuum will lead to a grand disaster; one which would result in the destruction of all universes and even prevent its rebirth."</p>
<p>"What! It was that risky?"</p>
<p>"I have no reason to lie to you. I've already accepted my loss."</p>
<p>"Then can I not return?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps with your ability to construct such precise arrays it might be possible, but I'll lend a hand just in case."</p>
<p>"Why would you help, don't you hate me?"</p>
<p>Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>Abaddon's booming laughter shook the heavens.</p>
<p>"Stop Abaddon! It hurts my ears!"</p>
<p>"It's true that to a certain extent I do hate you, after all you are the first existence to be able to make me suffer a loss. Even Sha and L weren't able to do so, only succeeding in trapping me temporarily."</p>
<p>"I know, and it seems that now you're back."</p>
<p>"Right, so more than anything, I'm interested in you, the first being to make me suffer defeat. The destruction of the universe being put off isn't all that big of a deal to me, I'm more curious about you than anything right now."</p>
<p>"What! You are talking about the end of the universe and all life within it as some sort of joke?"</p>
<p>"Well, it is nothing but a joke to me. Once you have the ability to recreate universes and life, then their value drops substantially in your eyes."</p>
<p>I felt some sympathy for the solitude evident in her empty eyes. The loneliness of someone who is unmatched and stand above all others.</p>
<p>"You're mistaken, Abaddon."</p>
<p>"How so?"</p>
<p>"Even if you can create anything in this universe and are all knowing about what is happening within it, that's your limit."</p>
<p>"Limit?"</p>
<p>"Just take me for example, you weren't able to beat me. Ask yourself why that is. Aren't you supposed to be the closest to omniscience and omnipotence?"</p>
<p>She thought about it carefully for a while before answering.</p>
<p>"You're talking about change?"</p>
<p>"Right, the changes which time brings about is the essence of existence. You just haven't had the chance to figure that out yet."</p>
<p>"Isn't change just a transition from the present to the future?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps, but if you were to experience life and the universe for the next 20 million years, perhaps your opinion on the matter might change."</p>
<p>"Is that what you think? Can you guarantee it?"</p>
<p>"Well...at least I think so."</p>
<p>"Will we meet again in 20 million years?"</p>
<p>"Well that depends..."</p>
<p>"Good, it's a promise then."</p>
<p>"What? I didn't say anything."</p>
<p>"No, you already consented. You might not have said it out loud but you accepted it in your mind."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Abaddon let out an evil laugh. She had caught me longing to see how much she would have changed after 20 million years.</p>
<p>'Damn'</p>
<p>"I had previously promised to lend a hand in your return, so I'll do so now and the other two times you jump."</p>
<p>"Uh..."</p>
<p>You need to go 20 million years into the future, but that may be too large of a leap and it might collapse on itself. It would be better to do it in three seperate jumps, and between each jump you'd need to repair the time continuum.</p>
<p>"I could restore it?"</p>
<p>"It seems that you haven't done so yet, but you have the ability to restore time and space. Simply find the space time paradox caused after each jump and fix it. It might be a bit time consuming but after that it should be fine."</p>
<p>"Ha, it almost sounds like a quest."</p>
<p>"Right, something like that."</p>
<p>"And how do I go about finding this paradox?"</p>
<p>"I can help you with that."</p>
<p>"Will you use that chance to meet up sooner in order to move up the date of our predestined battle?"</p>
<p>She shook her head in response.</p>
<p>"I shall seal all my memories and shall become a companion which aids you, until our battle's appointment that is."</p>
<p>"You are kinder than I expected."</p>
<p>"It's because I want to experience what you claimed about change and the essence of life with an open mind."</p>
<p>"I think that's a great choice, Abaddon."</p>
<p>"However I'd like to create a being that would retain some of my powers and memories, so that they can be returned to me when the time comes."</p>
<p>"Hm... I see, then is any vessel acceptable?"</p>
<p>"Sure, did you want to make it?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I also agree that it would be a waste not to use your powers to help the developments of the universe. Lena, prepare an android which will act as the guardian of all life."</p>
<p>"Got it."</p>
<p>After about ten months work, Lena greatest android creation was complete and Abaddon sealed part of her powers and memories within it.</p>
<p>"Thank you Creator, I will use this power to protect all human life, and when the time comes I shall return it to you."</p>
<p>"Uhm, did you give it the proper instructions?"</p>
<p>However Abaddon had fallen into a deep sleep after the transfer of her memories and power. Meanwhile the android was examining its new body.</p>
<p>"I think you should decide on your name."</p>
<p>"Abaddon had already decided."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I now have Abaddon's memories, remember? My name is Skyfather."</p>
<p>"What? Wait, you're Skyfather?!"</p>
<p>"Yes, Abaddon had learned of the future from your memories, so I will have to act in a manner which is consistent with that future. I'll begin by aiding these ratmen in their evolutions."</p>
<p>"Great, so you will do all you can to ensure that my future comes to fruition?"</p>
<p>"Yes, all will be done according to my Creator's will, Johra should next be transferred 6. 62 million years into the future. I have work to do."</p>
<p>"Hey! Hold on one moment!"</p>
<p>But the android which had turned into Skyfather disappeared into thin air.</p>
<p>"It seems that the entire future I had lived in was a consequence of the actions I had taken here...."</p>
<p>I stared out into the endless desert.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 131</p>
<p>"Oh well, what's done is done, right?"</p>
<p>I sighed as I stared out into the horizon.</p>
<p>I then looked around and noticed Abaddon's minions which appeared as colorful monsters gathering near the Doomsday gate. All the traps Lena and I had created were no longer in effect. Instead, they were like an immobile army of robots, not longer operational after having lost their source of directions. As I approached, they cried out in unison.</p>
<p>"We await master's command."</p>
<p>"Damn that's too loud! From now on you're the only one which answers me, alright?"</p>
<p>I said as I pointed towards the half dragon which just happened to be closest to me.</p>
<p>"What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Tron?"</p>
<p>"Just Tron?"</p>
<p>"Yes, master Abaddon called me so."</p>
<p>'Hm... he wouldn't be Metatron right?'</p>
<p>"I am Ortho-Tron. Meta-Tron remains in the space which Abaddon had previously been trapped in."</p>
<p>"What? How are you able to read my thoughts?"</p>
<p>"We all share a part of Abaddon's power. I was name Ortho-Tron because I recieved many powers from Abaddon, I am the strongest among us."</p>
<p>"Wait... Ortho, Meta...Is there a Para-Tron as well?"</p>
<p>"Yes, that guy's name is Para-Tron."</p>
<p>Ortho-Tron responded as he pointed towards a tortoise looking creature with a thick shell.</p>
<p>I facepalmed myself.</p>
<p>'So it seems like Metatron is already here, dammit!'</p>
<p>"Meta-Tron received a small portion of Abaddon's powers, but it was a unique power regarding time and space. Among us Trons none could defeat him."</p>
<p>"I see, then could you also travel back into that void you were previously trapped in?"</p>
<p>"It is impossible to do so without having powers like Abaddon."</p>
<p>"Then can Metatron choose to come here?"</p>
<p>"He received a total of 5 abilities from Abaddon. One of them does indeed allow him to go through the gate whenever he wishes."</p>
<p>"What? But he would also be under my command, right?"</p>
<p>"Metatron is unique, Abaddon has wished it so; therefore he is under no one's command.</p>
<p>"Ugh... how troublesome. As I remember Metatron was quite the loose cannon."</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Meta-Tron is still bound by Abaddon's will."</p>
<p>"Is he a Loyal minion?"</p>
<p>"I don't know what you are talking about."</p>
<p>"Ah, it seems that they still can't understand something which isn't part of their vocabulary."</p>
<p>I grumbled as I tried to reorganize my thoughts.</p>
<p>Metatron would definitely be a threat later on, but I currently had no way of dealing with him. Also, even if I could get to him I couldn't do anything since it would alter the future far too much.</p>
<p>"So what about you guys?"</p>
<p>"We follow master's orders. We were bestowed the power to destroy the universe."</p>
<p>"Ah,regarding that you no longer need to do it."</p>
<p>"We can't simply quit. Just as one would die if he stopped living, we would disappear if we stopped pursuing destruction. We can't do actions which go contrary to our very existence."</p>
<p>"What, why is it that you aren't following my commands to the letter? Did Abaddon not tell you to follow my every word?"</p>
<p>"Abaddon is our Creator and we are his destroyers. We must follow Abaddon's original intent."</p>
<p>" Fine, fine... go ahead and destroy. Destruction... I am getting fed up with that word."</p>
<p>After a whole day of brainstorming I finally devised a solution to keep them occupied.</p>
<p>"You are only capable of destruction, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we destroy all."</p>
<p>"Okay then, I will create something for you to destroy indefinitely. Lena!"</p>
<p>"Yes!"</p>
<p>"Let's design an immortal creature that can keep them occupied forever. I'll provide the materials."</p>
<p>"Forever?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Hmm... its a good research subject, a mix of regenerative and non sentient creature? What about the energy source?"</p>
<p>"I'll provide the antimatter and magic stones. Also it should be able to recycle the destroyed parts in order to...."</p>
<p>"So it has to be able to replenish itself with the nearby materials,right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"In order for it to thrive in any environment."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Ok, let me work on the schematics and I'll get back to you in about four hours."</p>
<p>"Alright."</p>
<p>After discussing that with Lena, I turned back to Ortho-Tron.</p>
<p>"How is it that you guys proceed with destruction?"</p>
<p>"We each obtained a part of Abaddon's powers."</p>
<p>"Go ahead and list them for me one by one."</p>
<p>While Lena was busy with designing the blueprints, I received the list of their abilities.</p>
<p>"Wow... it's like a comprehensive list of all skills and spells in existence."</p>
<p>"It's because it's Abaddon's power."</p>
<p>"Then can you pass on your powers onto others?"</p>
<p>"It is possible, but it would depends on the vessels and their ability to wield it may vary."</p>
<p>"Okay, that's all for now."</p>
<p>For now the plan was to create a suitable opponent, and balance it so that their fight would last indefinitely. It would certainly be a better alternative to the destruction of the universe.</p>
<p>"Johra the designs are complete."</p>
<p>"Okay, let me take a look."</p>
<p>"I'll project it directly to your cornea."</p>
<p>Shortly after a complex schematics appeared in my sight, taking my breath away.</p>
<p>Previously I wouldn't have been able to understand such complicated designs; however after becoming a God my visualization skills had improved drastically.</p>
<p>"What... so it's this tree...."</p>
<p>"When considering a non sentient creature, this plant came to mind."</p>
<p>"Ah... I see. So in the end I was also responsible for the creation of the World Tree?"</p>
<p>That's right, the result of Lena's design was the World Tree Yggdrasil. A plant which would grow up into space indefinitely, drawing upon the resources of the world for nourishment.</p>
<p>Such was the design of the being which Tron would have to destroy indefinitely.</p>
<p>"Dammit."</p>
<p>"What's wrong Johra, you don't like it?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing, I'm just angry with myself."</p>
<p>"Is it because of the nature of the World Tree?"</p>
<p>"Yes, somewhat. So will this tree even be able to resist the powers of destruction?"</p>
<p>"In order to improve its defensive powers it draws the necessary nourishment from across the universes. Then, in turn it creates the nectar which aids in the leveling up and evolution of other species, all in accordance with your memories."</p>
<p>By fighting for a share of that World's Nectar, a creature can evolve and improve its strength. This was all a part of Lena's design, but I felt terrible that I had been the one create the world tree and was therefore responsible for all the blood spilt in the future wars over its nectar.</p>
<p>"Okay, make it."</p>
<p>Over the next four days, I followed along Lena's designs as I created the genetic map for the seed. I then planted it in a large three meter magic array powered by multiple magic stones. The array was also set to follow the growth of the tree, so as to not be left behind.</p>
<p>"That should be about right."</p>
<p>Just as I finished putting the final touches, the tree began to sprout before my very eyes despite it being in a arid desert.</p>
<p>"Master is it okay to destroy that thing?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you can attempt to destroy the tree, but don't go after the creatures which harvest its nectar."</p>
<p>"I understand we will focus only on the tree. Since it grows along with the energy of the universe, then it is in line with our purpose of destroying the universe."</p>
<p>"Yes, but you can't destroy it right away, you have to give it a chance to grow up first."</p>
<p>"Okay, we will wait for that time."</p>
<p>"Hey, Wait!"</p>
<p>However the group of Trons had disappeared before I could finish.</p>
<p>"Tch! That guy! He just says his piece and leaves when he's done."</p>
<p>I watched as the Yggdrasil grew past a hundred meters and felt my heart ache.</p>
<p>"Will this world be in danger if it keeps growing at this pace?"</p>
<p>"Don't worry Johra, it will soon break into outer space and draw its energy from there."</p>
<p>"I see... a hundred meter tall tree in the middle of a desert, it looks absurd."</p>
<p>I let out a macabre chuckle, envision the future of the universe due to the construction of this World Tree.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 132</p>
<p>"Good, now it's time to get back at those who made me suffer. Material Creation! Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created a vacuum tube and filled it with positrons.</p>
<p>"I'll throw this at the planet, so if you don't show your faces things won't end well."</p>
<p>I tossed the fragile tube toward the ground. As soon as the vial is broken, the energy contained in the positron would be enough to wipe out the entire planet.</p>
<p>"Dammit! Just what are you trying to pull, Johra?"</p>
<p>The next second two people appeared before me.</p>
<p>"Sha and L, I presume?</p>
<p>"Uh...."</p>
<p>L, a blond handsome man had caught the vial at the very last second, as he wiped the sweat from his forehead. Sha, who had black hair and tanned skin looked back at me.</p>
<p>"That's right right Johra, but why would you pull such a stunt?"</p>
<p>"Was it you guys who summoned me?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Just why is that? There are plenty of Gods better than I."</p>
<p>"Ha, you don't remember do you? Well in truth I would have also forgotten were it not for Sha's reminder."</p>
<p>"Remember what? And actually why is it that you are speaking to me so politely?"</p>
<p>"You are the one that created us."</p>
<p>"What did you just say?"</p>
<p>I was left completely speechless.</p>
<p>In the past few days I had finally come to grips with all this universe and time space stuff, and now out of nowhere I learned that I was the creator of the mighty Sha and L</p>
<p>"Are you trying to make a fool out of me?"</p>
<p>"Don't you remember anything?"</p>
<p>"Of course not! I don't remember anything about you! Are there now even more secrets which I'm not aware of?"</p>
<p>I stared at Sha accusingly, but she shook her head.</p>
<p>"L?"</p>
<p>"Well, what should I say, I guess I could start with the fact that Abaddon and us were originally one being."</p>
<p>"Huh?"</p>
<p>"What did Abaddon tell you? That it was her father that created the universes?"</p>
<p>"Something like...."</p>
<p>"She was lying."</p>
<p>"Really? That's funny because she had said the same thing about you two."</p>
<p>L stopped speaking as he gnashed his teeth in frustration.</p>
<p>"Sha had only roughly explained the situation to Evelysla. Abaddon and us were originally one, and we were known as Alpha. Abaddon is the Omega which was once a part of Alpha.</p>
<p>"Alpha? Omega?"</p>
<p>"Every universe has a beginning and an end. The first is phase is known as the Alpha and the last as the Omega. When Omega was in the process of ending the universe, you appeared and stopped it in its tracks."</p>
<p>"Wha... me? I don't remember"</p>
<p>"Of course you can't. The time that you interfered is 20 billion years in your future."</p>
<p>"20 billion years? The future me?"</p>
<p>L shook his head.</p>
<p>Not the place you just came from, but an even more future you. The time when the universe was about to switch between Alpha and Omega is when you interfered."</p>
<p>"Me? How?"</p>
<p>I asked curiously.</p>
<p>"You were the one who seperated Omega from us Alpha, you're the reason that Abaddon exists.</p>
<p>"Why would I do that?"</p>
<p>To keep the universe functioning in perpetuity. I represent Infinity and Sha is the phase of Eternity."</p>
<p>"What is a phase?"</p>
<p>"A gap between time and space which results in the creation of Gods. The principles of Eternity and Infinity are crucial building blocks of the space time continuum."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure what it is you're talking about. So far all I've understood is that you guys and Abaddon were originally one and the creators of these universes, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"And I separated you all in order for the universes not to be destroyed?"</p>
<p>"Right"</p>
<p>"So it's only natural for Abaddon to be hell bent on the destruction of the universes, since this is her existential purpose right?"</p>
<p>"Yes. If we were to face each other, she would immediately absorb us which would result in her becoming the Omega once more."</p>
<p>"So what happened to the future me, why was I summoned here?"</p>
<p>"After separating us you disappeared completely."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Also before leaving you asked us to do you this favor of summoning you."</p>
<p>"Ah, so it was something the future me wanted to happen?"</p>
<p>"Yup."</p>
<p>"So, I separated Alpha and Omega to prevent the end of the universes in 40 billion years from now, and then left the mess it created to the past me to deal with?"</p>
<p>They both nodded back to me.</p>
<p>'It seems like I've been causing a mess wherever I go, even if I can't remember it. '</p>
<p>"If you wouldn't have split eternity and infinity, we would have all been buried along with the end of universe."</p>
<p>"Actually I don't care. Does it even matter if the universe ends in 40 billion?"</p>
<p>I was getting fed up with this whole situation and was ready to turn my back on saving the universe.</p>
<p>"Usually after a 40 billion year cycle of complete thermal equilibrium, a chain reaction is set in motion to begin the universe's reincarnation. However, since you tampered too much with the space time continuum, it resulted in a great catastrophe."</p>
<p>"Ah~ so it was my fault once again."</p>
<p>I let in out in resignation.</p>
<p>"Right, that future you told us that the reason the universe was going to end was due to a certain promise."</p>
<p>"Promise?"</p>
<p>"Yes, all you had told us was that it had been a promise made in a dream."</p>
<p>"I have no idea what that might mean."</p>
<p>Naturally I had an inkling, but I didn't want to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>"Ok, but now it's time for you to go into the future. If you stay here any longer then you will only bring further harm to the universes stability.</p>
<p>Sha moved her lips but no sound came out. I pointed towards her questioningly.</p>
<p>"Why is she moving her mouth like that?"</p>
<p>"We are twins, so she is speaking in a way that only I can hear."</p>
<p>"Are you two really twins?"</p>
<p>"Yes, although with different personalities and temperaments."</p>
<p>Sha and L then proceeded to bow down to me.</p>
<p>"Thank you for helping us out once again, past sir Johra."</p>
<p>"If I had to be honest I still don't know what you are talking about, but I guess I should get going into the future right?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Sha will help you with the magic array."</p>
<p>She arrived beside me and as she waved her arms, bright spherical and cubic patterns appeared in complex formations.</p>
<p>"Johra her ability is remarkable. The material she is using for the array is lighter than air, but it's stability surpasses anything we've achieved. Also she seems to chain several Material Creations...."</p>
<p>I proceed to simply ignore Lena's praise and asked.</p>
<p>"Will we meet again next time?"</p>
<p>"Of course."</p>
<p>"Then at that time, be sure to tell me about my future in more details."</p>
<p>"Sha nodded her head and then looked towards L.</p>
<p>"Then see you in 6. 62 billion years."</p>
<p>Shoot</p>
<p>As soon a L activated the magic array, I was sucked into a deep darkness.</p>
<p>"This should be fun."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 133</p>
<p>"Jora? Sir Johra?"</p>
<p>"Umm..."</p>
<p>As if waking up from a deep slumber, I felt someone shaking me awake.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you've arrived, Johra."</p>
<p>A huge titan appeared before me holding me up on his palm to see a gorgeous sunset.</p>
<p>I was momentarily stunned by the breathtaking scene, before turning back and asking the titan.</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"I'm L's faithful servant, Killion."</p>
<p>"Oh, so you're Killion...."</p>
<p>I was shocked to find that I was currently in the palm of one of the last four Metatron followers.</p>
<p>"Have you heard of me?"</p>
<p>I looked carefully towards the titan name Killion.</p>
<p>"Johra, it seems that he differs in many ways from how the ancient texts described Killion."</p>
<p>Lena advice arrived promptly. Naturally he wasn't able to hear her speaking since she did it through my bone conduction.</p>
<p>"Ah, perhaps I was mistaken. Was it L who sent you? Where is he now?"</p>
<p>"Elder L is in hiding."</p>
<p>"Hiding?"</p>
<p>"Yes, since you were missing and now Metatron appeared...."</p>
<p>"What? Metatron has appeared?"</p>
<p>"Right, it happened 100 million years ago, ever since that time he's been fighting Skyfather."</p>
<p>"Fighting Skyfather? Why?"</p>
<p>"Something about wanting to get Abaddon back. Anyways this place isn't safe right now since their fleet will soon meet in battle nearby."</p>
<p>"Fleets? What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Ah... I'd like to take the time to explain it to you properly but we don't have that luxury. Please come with me immediately."</p>
<p>"Okay then...since it's too risky here."</p>
<p>A bright light which enveloped the both of us was cast from Killion hands.</p>
<p>"What is that light?"</p>
<p>"A particle transmitter."</p>
<p>Shhoo</p>
<p>Shortly after we appeared in a large hall made out of pristine marble.</p>
<p>As Killion walked through the air while still holding me in his palm, I noticed a bunch of UI popping up around us. They gave information on the surrounding stars as well as the layout of the numerous ships, all in 3D.</p>
<p>"That's a great interface, there's a lot I can learn from this."</p>
<p>Lena's curiosity had been piqued by this superior technology.</p>
<p>"We're out of the danger zone. Enable autopilot."</p>
<p>BBiBBi</p>
<p>As soon as Killion gave the command the UI highlighted the most suitable path, for what I assumed to be the massive ship we were currently in.</p>
<p>"Forgive my prior rudeness."</p>
<p>Killion exclaimed as he set me down gently on the ground.</p>
<p>"Not at all, if anything it is I who should thank you for coming to meet me and following L's instructions to the letter."</p>
<p>"It is only natural, I'm a creature created by L for the purpose of serving you, Johra. The meaning of my very existence is to assist you in solving the dangers of this universe."</p>
<p>"Um.. I think I might have misheard. Did you just say solving dangers?"</p>
<p>"Oh, were you not aware? The elder said that as soon as Johra arrived then all would be alright."</p>
<p>"I'm not sure what it was that L told you, but he must have been wrong. I'm not here to solve any dangers, this is just a short stop before I return to my own time period."</p>
<p>Killion stayed deep in thought for a while before responding.</p>
<p>"Oh right, L told me to tell you that if you don't stop this fight between Metatron and Skyfather, your future will no longer exist."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Sha's predictions had been wrong. Something to do with the space time continuum being altered. Sorry, I'm not entirely sure what it means either.."</p>
<p>"Johra, perhaps the the small actions you've taken have already had an influence on the future. If it is as L said and Metatron and Skyfather keep on fighting, then its natural for the future we know to disappear as well."</p>
<p>Lena explained her understanding of the situation.</p>
<p>'Shit! I don't want to get involved in a fight between those two monsters. Why can't I just peacefully return back to my own time period?'</p>
<p>"Skyather's fleet has just made contact with Metatron's. It will mark the official start of the 10th universe war."</p>
<p>Killion explained and I knew that I had to do something.</p>
<p>"10th war? So this isn't the first time? Just how many people are involved in this war?"</p>
<p>"In the past nine wars all planets which had more than 10 thousand inhabitants were wiped out. We've been fighting almost nonstop and to date the death count of these wars is in the billions.."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by nonstop?"</p>
<p>"Pretty much ever since Metatron appeared."</p>
<p>"So you've been at war for about 100 million years simply because of some wacky subordinate of Abaddon?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps it is just the way of the Gods to wage war. The universe is simply a battleground for the immortals and the strongest among them fight wars to amass more power. The very purpose of life across the universe is likewise for war. There are tens of millions of life forms which were created for this very purpose and all the resources of the universe are being sucked up to support this war between these two sides.</p>
<p>"I see... so whether it is the 1st war or the 10th, it doesn't really make much of a difference for you does it."</p>
<p>"That's right, despite Metatron being a very powerful god, he has no chance in winning against Skyfather and his followers. Although it is true that he also has Gods on his side, it seems he's achieved this through some sort of brainwashing which is only effective on minor gods."</p>
<p>"Brainwashing huh... and as I recall he also had a certain control over space time as well."</p>
<p>"That's right. In fact, so far as I know, the only reason he hasn't been defeated yet is that he can escape safely every time."</p>
<p>"Still Skyfather is pretty amazing to have beaten him nine times."</p>
<p>"Well, he hasn't been able to finish things because at the very last minute Metatron has used his brainwashing ability."</p>
<p>"What, then Skyfather has always had the upper hand?"</p>
<p>"Right, but despite Skyfather having inherited supreme abilities from Abaddon, which means that no Gods can match him, not even Metatron. He still hasn't been able to deliver the finishing blow because when Metatron uses his brainwashing ability he can turn the minor Gods following Skyfather against him, buying him enough time to escape with his ability over time."</p>
<p>"Still, Skyfather is stronger than I expected."</p>
<p>"Definitely the two strongest Gods right now are Skyfather and Metatron."</p>
<p>"So did L not give any further instruction as to what I should do?"</p>
<p>"There was one thing, he mentioned that Metatron's weakness was his emotions."</p>
<p>"Emotions huh... L is quite clever."</p>
<p>I clicked my tongue, it seemed that Metatron had always been obsessed with Abaddon.</p>
<p>It would also explain while he would rather escape than risk harming Skyfather.</p>
<p>"By the way Killion, before travelling I need to fix a certain paradox in the space time continuum. Is there any news about that?"</p>
<p>"Oh right, I almost forgot. Sha did say something reggarding that. She said that if you were to encounter the situation, you would understand it naturally."</p>
<p>"That basically means that I need to figure it out myself. no?"</p>
<p>"L and Sha are not the benevolent type."</p>
<p>"Sigh* How annoying, and here I thought I could just travel immediately to my own future."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 134</p>
<p>"Killion, I have a favor to ask of you."</p>
<p>"I am Johra's faithful servant."</p>
<p>I felt a tinge of regret seeing him act so politely towards me.</p>
<p>"I know what will happen in the future."</p>
<p>"I stand in awe at your great power, lord."</p>
<p>"So basically I need you to remember what I'm about to tell you, and transmit it to Metatron."</p>
<p>"So... is that truly my task?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it is indeed your fate."</p>
<p>"Okay Johra, since it's my destiny I have no choice but to accept it."</p>
<p>"I felt quite sorry for him seeing the resolve on his face, but it was a necessary sacrifice to ensure the correct future."</p>
<p>After about three hours of explanation, I had finished giving Killion my detailed instructions.</p>
<p>"That's amazing, Johra."</p>
<p>"Not really, it's just a small cheat which someone like me who knows the future can employ."</p>
<p>"Alright."</p>
<p>"Wait a minute, Lena, did you prepare the blueprints I asked of you?</p>
<p>"I'll project it as a hologram."</p>
<p>With it I was able to create the product.</p>
<p>"Here, use this Killion. It will be necessary in order to undertake you task."</p>
<p>"Yes sir!"</p>
<p>Killion and I then spent the next 60 days in order for him to familiarize himself with it.</p>
<p>"I have to go meet Skyfather, do you have a spare ship I can use?"</p>
<p>"No need, you can take this one. I will simply use an escape pod."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll pray for your success, Killion."</p>
<p>"Thank you for your blessings, my lord.</p>
<p>"When we next meet, I'll greet you warmly once again."</p>
<p>"Just hearing that alone, I now feel complete."</p>
<p>"No, rather it is because you are undertaking a worthy sacrifice."</p>
<p>"Yes, then I shall leave first. It seems that when we next meet we might be on opposing sides."</p>
<p>"Hm... it'll come to pass, so there's no reason to feel afraid."</p>
<p>Killion bowed deeply before disappearing into streaks of light as he used the particle transmitter. In the distance his escape pod appeared and opened an FTL gate (faster than light) which it disappeared into.</p>
<p>"It seems like the dice have been cast. It was the most secure option to ensure the future."</p>
<p>I spoke out loud as I stared out into the stars.</p>
<p>Making one sacrifice for the good of others. I had trouble justifying my actions. However, for an individual to have the courage to willingly sacrifice themselves for the benefit of others, one could only call that heroic. Nevertheless, form the viewpoint of that hero, it is still an unhappy life.</p>
<p>'I have sacrificed so many things, and all for what?'</p>
<p>We had to kill in order to collect experience and evolve, often putting myself in life and death situations.</p>
<p>I had asked so many of those around me to sacrifice themselves for the sake of my friends and family who are closest to me.</p>
<p>From the perspective of natural selection, perhaps it was all normal. Still, I was now the God of Creation and I had to do what was necessary. Justice did not exist in nature. I no longer had to reflect on my own actions and should simply take the path of necessity.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and came to that realization, undergoing a fundamental change in my very soul, before opening them up again.</p>
<p>"Lena, pilot the ship, I'm going to meet Skyfather."</p>
<p>"Understood."</p>
<p>As the spaceship aligned its course, the constellations which could be seen on the UI holograms changed. Shortly after the FTL gate was opened and Lena began her countdown.</p>
<p>"3...2...1, successfully entered Hyperspace. According to my reading we will only exit in 3 hours, 27 minutes and 14 seconds.</p>
<p>"Wow, that's pretty confusing."</p>
<p>The FTL gate was a technology which spacetime unto itself, enabling travel which exceeded the speed of light.</p>
<p>The hyperspace which resulted from such actions projected images of all that has happened in my life</p>
<p>It was as if death was flashing before my eyes as I watched a movie of all my entire life. From the time spent as a high schooler which I could no longer remember, to falling down the manhole, my struggle to survive on this new world as an undead and the my fight with the angels. Everything was portrayed before me and I unknowingly began to shed tears.</p>
<p>"In retrospect I've lived a truly lonely life."</p>
<p>For the next three hours I watched this pseudo-film of my life over and over again, until finally we had arrived.</p>
<p>"Entering normal space in 3...2...1. All equipment seems to be functioning properly, there are a large number of vessels in our proximity."</p>
<p>"Ok, open up a line of communication and inform them of my name and intention to meet Skyfather."</p>
<p>"Understood."</p>
<p>It took but a few moments before a hologram of Skyfather appeared before me.</p>
<p>"It's been quite some time, Johra. So it seems you've returned."</p>
<p>Seeing his smug face almost made me lose it. He had known all along when it was I would return.</p>
<p>"Skyfather you've become quite impudent, treating your creator in such a way."</p>
<p>"Ah really? I don't have such a strong impression of it since it was all a very long time ago. Somehow my so called Creator is now so much weaker than me that I can destroy you with but a single finger.</p>
<p>I wasn't sure how I should respond to that, but I knew that I couldn't show any weakness.</p>
<p>I could only gnash my teeth in anger and endure.</p>
<p>I knew that Skyfather had been fully aware off my return, but seeing as he didn't make any effort to seet me out, it was clear that he didn't have any good intentions.</p>
<p>In other words, Skyfather had now become my enemy despite the fact that I was the one who had built him.</p>
<p>This only fueled my determination as I replied to the hologram confidently.</p>
<p>"Yes, you've made a few mistakes but it's normal since you are still young. I'll clean up your mess since I know Metatron's weakness."</p>
<p>I noticed a complex expression fill his face.</p>
<p>His reaction was within my expectations since Metatron was his only rival.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 135</p>
<p>"Okay, Old God. release your shield and I'll transfer you over."</p>
<p>He exclaimed somewhat arrogantly, but his face still had a slight frown.</p>
<p>"Lena, lower the shield."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Shoot</p>
<p>I was bathed in a bright light, and the next moment my surroundings had changed.</p>
<p>Skyfather was hovering in the middle of a large hall with only his upper torso. Unlike in the hologram, I could see several scars and missing parts on his body.</p>
<p>"Why is it that you only have half your body and are so injured?"</p>
<p>"Huhuhu... although your body might be important for your life, that isn't the case for me who is an android."</p>
<p>Looking at the android we had built before us, I felt a certain wisdom in his words, one brought about by countless years of experience.</p>
<p>"Lena, scan him and show me the results."</p>
<p>"Got it."</p>
<p>"You dare observe my body without my permission!"</p>
<p>Chaaaaat</p>
<p>With a swish of Skyfather's hand a shield appeared around him.</p>
<p>"I simply wish to take a look and your injuries and mean you no harm."</p>
<p>Shortly after Lena sent the results to my cornea.</p>
<p>"You have quite a few parts which have been worn out or missing. Why haven't you replaced them?"</p>
<p>"Too noisy, I called you here...."</p>
<p>"I can tell you why. Your current bodily parts are all those which I had made 6. 6 billion years ago. If you haven't replaced them, isn't it because you simply don't have the ability to do so?"</p>
<p>"It's all because of you. You took a mere machine and gave it divinity, making it impossible to replace my own parts."</p>
<p>"Ah... well I'm sorry, I hadn't considered that."</p>
<p>"What sorry! You're my Creator, you should be perfect and omnipotent in every way! Also why do you look so weak and why have you made me like this."</p>
<p>It seems that he had been piling up some resentment over the years which was now exploding out.</p>
<p>"Are you getting emotional?"</p>
<p>I didn't expect it to have any feelings because when Lena created it, it was nothing more than a mere machine.</p>
<p>"These useless feelings hinder my decision making. I have to be true to my purpose, but these feelings are constantly getting in the way. I've raised living beings who have loved me, only to later die for my very cause. Meaningless deaths which are eating away at me from the inside. Creator, please do something for me! Get rid of these pointless feelings I'm experiencing."</p>
<p>"Well, that's what you get when you've experienced life for 6. 6 billion years."</p>
<p>I was somewhat able to understand why he was so cold towards me.</p>
<p>The memories and emotions he'd felt over this long period of time, only made the loss and pain all the worse when those loved ones disappeared.</p>
<p>"I'm truly sorry Skyfather, but I can't take your feelings away from you."</p>
<p>"Why is that Johra? Aren't you the one who made me! Since you've made me then you have to take responsibility for what you have done. It's your duty to improve your creation. I have been faithfully fulfilling my purpose, so now it's your turn to do this for me."</p>
<p>Ziiiiing, Chulkuk chulkuk</p>
<p>Hundreds of robotic arms appeared from the sides and made their way towards me.</p>
<p>"Lena, raise the shield."</p>
<p>Ziiing</p>
<p>Thankfully it was able to block them.</p>
<p>"Don't think you can stop me with such backwater technology. I don't have much time to converse with you."</p>
<p>"Okay, but first of all, why is it that you think feelings are bad?"</p>
<p>"For the purpose I was given, these feelings are nothing but a hindrance. However I've never been able to suppress them due to the safeguards you had placed within me."</p>
<p>He was referring to the same limiters which Odin had placed on Thor's Mjölnir, which made it impossible to interfere with Skyfather's AI core. It was a combination of magic and science.</p>
<p>"You're going about this all wrong, your feelings are your greatest asset. Did you ever take the time to stop and think what it is you wish to do in your life?"</p>
<p>The robotic arms which Skyfather was controlling had begun to cast cast arrays and it wouldn't be long now before they penetrated the Rohim's shield. I only had until then to make him change his views.</p>
<p>"The purpose you had given me was to give life into the future, where as Abaddon had tasked me with exploring the value of change...."</p>
<p>"That's right, but in fact the two are one and the same."</p>
<p>"Are you saying that my feelings represent change?"</p>
<p>He asked with a frown.</p>
<p>"That's right. Your emotions are a direct result of change and also the greatest value out of anything else you've experienced this entire time."</p>
<p>"No, I can't accept that. I've that's true then it isn't worth it...."</p>
<p>"I know that emotions are a difficult thing to manage, Skyfather, but they aren't something to be ignored or suppressed. Think about it, when I first created you, you were nothing, a simple machine filled with knowledge and a purpose. But look at you now, you're alive!"</p>
<p>"I'm alive? Nonsense, I'm still nothing but a glorified android."</p>
<p>"Yes, but being alive means much more than just breathing. It's building relationships, memories and sometimes, it also means suffering loss. Even if you may have taken the wrong path, the feelings you've experienced are proof that you are alive.</p>
<p>"You're saying that this bitterness and pain that I feel is worth it? Nothing but empty words!"</p>
<p>"Yes, the pain that you feel when someone that you loved or even was close to you is lost, that hurts. But that pain is a reminder that you are alive, and so I can't take your emotions away from you."</p>
<p>"Why?! You've created me, so now free me from this torment!"</p>
<p>"It was...."</p>
<p>I had to take a breath and gather my thoughts.</p>
<p>"You need to accept your feelings one step at the time. Sure dealing with pain is difficult, but by overcoming such hardships, the pain felt will slowly lessen. This is the change which I spoke to Abaddon about."</p>
<p>"Nothing but Sophistry! You incompetent Creator! You have nothing to offer me! You've cursed me to 6. 6 billion years of pain. That's 6. 6 billion years!"</p>
<p>"Yes, and I'm sorry about that. I can't imagine the suffering you must have undergone, but this was an opportunity for you and I'm glad that you've found your own path to life as a result of it. I don't know what is the perfect way to live, because I have not discovered it myself. Perhaps you will do so before me, my son!"</p>
<p>"Ridiculous, I'm not your son! I'm just a lump of metal brought together for a specific purpose!"</p>
<p>"Don't you realize that you're already much more than that, Skyfather?"</p>
<p>"I won't admit it!"</p>
<p>The Rohim's shield had finally collapsed.</p>
<p>"Let's head back, Lena."</p>
<p>"Yes sir!"</p>
<p>Lena instantly activated the array which we had prepared ahead of time.</p>
<p>"I won't forgive you Johra!"</p>
<p>"Ciao!"</p>
<p>I waved my hand and bid him goodbye, just before the magic array activated.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 136</p>
<p>I stood at the base of Yggdrasil.</p>
<p>"A large number of creatures have developed around it."</p>
<p>"The old desert of Eden was no more. In its place where thick and lush forests with tall canopies which blotted out the sun."</p>
<p>"It's changed a lot."</p>
<p>These were the fruits of that seed I had planted 6. 6 billion years ago. I felt moved, in awe of the power and tenacity of life.</p>
<p>"I wonder how much its grown."</p>
<p>Was the first thought which came to mind as I walked up to the World Tree, looking up and being unable to fathom its height.</p>
<p>Swoosh! Swoosh!</p>
<p>Hundreds of arrows landed before me as a telepathic warning appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>"What was that?"</p>
<p>"Elves... no, with those features I guess they'd be High Elves."</p>
<p>'Don't come any closer, stranger! If you approach the Great Mother, then the next arrows will pierce your heart. '</p>
<p>"Annoying... Lena put up a shield."</p>
<p>"On it."</p>
<p>I ignored their warning and simply walked forward.</p>
<p>Swoosh! Swoosh! Ping!</p>
<p>Hundreds of arrows took flight, but the results were as expected. Those primitive arrows which would even have trouble piercing leather armor, didn't even leave a dent on the shield.</p>
<p>'Prepare to pay the price of ignoring our goodwill!'</p>
<p>They sent out telepathically as I noticed dozens of High Elves casting their magic.</p>
<p>"Oh, resorting to magic now is it? Fine, I've had enough of your impudence. Material Creation! Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I once again created a vacuum tube and filled it with a very small amount of positron.</p>
<p>"Lena!"</p>
<p>"You are only planning to stun them, right Johra?"</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"I've calculated the blast zone and projected it on your cornea. I'll also activate the shield when the time comes, so please throw it whenever you are ready."</p>
<p>Kuuuuuuukung</p>
<p>After a far toss, the positrons which exploded in the distance resulted in an enormous shockwave. My shield was easily able to absorb it, but all the nearby Elves had been instantly knocked unconscious.</p>
<p>"All 314 of them have fainted. There have been no deaths and not even any serious injuries."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>I had finally arrived within an arms lengths of the tree trunk.</p>
<p>"Lena?"</p>
<p>"By simply raising your arm, you can activate the master key."</p>
<p>Ziing</p>
<p>I was teleported to the core of the World Tree.</p>
<p>"Oh, this is pretty cool."</p>
<p>"Of course, this is the result of our planning and its evolution over the past 6. 6 billion years."</p>
<p>I had mixed in parts of Lena when creating Yggdrasil. The nano parts we had left behind were based on what we knew of the Worlds Nectar, which helped shape its evolution during all these years.</p>
<p>The World Tree was a product of magic and engineering, but it could also be regarded as a supremely evolved version of Lena.</p>
<p>What would be the result of an evolution based A. I. with 6. 6 billion years of experience.</p>
<p>"Welcome Creator Johra."</p>
<p>A message rang throughout the room in a warm greeting.</p>
<p>"I've been in a bind, why is it that you haven't reached out yet?</p>
<p>"Please call me Machina"</p>
<p>"You want to be referred to as a machine? You've already evolved far past that point."</p>
<p>"Since I'm your creation, Machina will suffice."</p>
<p>"Okay, but you won't betray me in the same way Skyfather has, will you?"</p>
<p>"I'm faithful to my cause. Skyfather who is plagued with Abaddon's divinity, he has however followed Johra's command for the last 6,600,002,542 years, 11 months, 3 days, 2 hours, 5 minutes and 21 seconds."</p>
<p>"Hmm... Avadon's divinity...then is yours a different one?"</p>
<p>"It is Johra's divinity which had given me life, so I am dedicated to your cause."</p>
<p>"And what do you believe to be my cause, Machina?"</p>
<p>"I've had a long time to examine it. Every cell of mine is infused with nano particles, and my body has grown to pierce through 134,424 different universes. Any information can be transmitted within me at speeds which exceeds light and I can think faster than any other living being. Through this analysis I've come to the conclusion that I exist for the sole purpose of supporting life to these universes.</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha, you're right my child!"</p>
<p>"Thank you, Creator Johra."</p>
<p>I was then briefed by Machina about what had happened over the years. It was 6. 6 billion years worth of information, so it took 100 days before it could summarize everything.</p>
<p>"Well, I guess I know everything I need."</p>
<p>"Will you be heading out?"</p>
<p>"Yes Machina, you've done well in your duties as a watcher while I've been away."</p>
<p>"As you well know, my branches have spread to every universe. Most of the things which creatures refer to as magic is simply based on a system I have created. I can hand you the power to override all kinds of magic."</p>
<p>"Oh, is that so?"</p>
<p>"Yes, you can use any spell you want, and you can also choose to negate any magic as well."</p>
<p>"Wasn't magic a product of elementary particles, I think Lena had explained it to me as such."</p>
<p>"That is correct, but it is my network which controls the situation because I created it that way in every universe which I've spread myself to."</p>
<p>"Hmm... it's indeed true that everything within a universe is now under your influence."</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Perhaps we can use it for more than just influencing though."</p>
<p>"You can also monitor any situation at any given moment. My branches stretch out to every corner of all the universes, there isn't any information which I don't know about."</p>
<p>"Great, but sometimes knowing too much can be a bad thing."</p>
<p>I'll remember that, Creator Johra.</p>
<p>You have done enough already, Lena, set up the array."</p>
<p>"Got it!"</p>
<p>As Lena was hard at work with the array, I instructed Machina.</p>
<p>"Be ready to respond to my call at any time."</p>
<p>"Yes, Creator Johra. Are you referring to the spare parts of Skyfather and the time travel machine?"</p>
<p>"Yes, those too, but first I'll go and meet and old friend.</p>
<p>"We will stay in touch, Creator."</p>
<p>Shhot</p>
<p>The next moment the array had activated and my surroundings had changed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 137</p>
<p>I appeared in the alley of a city which seemed to have been developed by a machine civilization.</p>
<p>"Is this the right place, Lena?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I'll show the location on the map.</p>
<p>BiiBBib</p>
<p>A mini map appeared, indicating the location of the person I wanted to meet.</p>
<p>As I walked out of the alley, I saw a street filled with flowers of great beauty, covered in its entirety by a large dome in the sky.</p>
<p>"Feels like we are in some Sci-Fi."</p>
<p>I exclaimed after seeing the domed city. Although I had already known about it due to Machina's report, seeing it first hand was an entirely different feeling.</p>
<p>The human race of this age had already proceeded into the cosmic era. Although it was a civilization which existed long before mine, It was strange to see that they were so much more advanced than Earth.</p>
<p>This very place is an artificial planet with large skyscrapers and a population of a billion people.</p>
<p>The planets name was Gehenna, and it was only medium sized and located in a rather remote area of space. There had already been more than one million artificially created planets built in outer space.</p>
<p>"Johra, the target is on the move."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll hurry up."</p>
<p>I sped up in order to quickly catch up.</p>
<p>"What's going on, why is she moving so fast?"</p>
<p>"It appears the target has noticed the fact that Johra is following."</p>
<p>"Hmm, using magic is risky so I'll just outsmart her."</p>
<p>The target had glanced behind expertly as she turned the corner.</p>
<p>"I'll mark you her expected route and you can intercept her midway."</p>
<p>"Okay, I guess I can delay catching her for a little while."</p>
<p>I walked around the corner of another alley and lay in wait.</p>
<p>"Now Johra."</p>
<p>"Caught you...."</p>
<p>"Bam!"</p>
<p>I had just grabbed my target's sleeve, but the next thing I knew my head was stuck in the ground.</p>
<p>"Hey... that's a bit much no?"</p>
<p>After having thrown me, she had escaped without once looking back.</p>
<p>"Huh, it seems that she doesn't like strangers."</p>
<p>I stood up and patted the dust of my clothes.</p>
<p>"She'll probably be heading towards her house, se we can just go there first and set an ambush."</p>
<p>"Alright."</p>
<p>When I was about to finish making my preparations, I got word from Lena.</p>
<p>"Target's home has been located, but it seems that she's already left."</p>
<p>"Great, shall we step inside?"</p>
<p>Zzing</p>
<p>I stood before the front door while Lena hacked her way in.</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>"That's pretty cool no?"</p>
<p>"Sure, but it's still inferior to the Rohim's technology."</p>
<p>After unlocking his door, I stepped inside and began setting up the traps. After that was done, I headed to his kitchen and whipped myself up a meal.</p>
<p>"It seems that their diet isn't so different from ours."</p>
<p>I found the refrigerator and after fishing out some ingredients, began chopping them up with a knife.</p>
<p>"To celebrate our long awaited reunion, a home cooked meal would be best."</p>
<p>An hour or so later the food was ready and the timing couldn't be more perfect as there was movement by the door.</p>
<p>"Just in time, come on in!"</p>
<p>"You're that guy from before. Why are you in my house?"</p>
<p>Chulkuk Chulkuk</p>
<p>The trap which I had previously constructed was sprung, and restrained her in a very thorough fashion. She struggled and foamed at the mouth from the gag which had been inserted, but wasn't able to escape.</p>
<p>"I call that thing the Redeemer. It's a combination of both magic and science and isn't at all easy to escape from. Perhaps if you had your original strength you could get out, but right now it's impossible."</p>
<p>I felt her eyes burning with hatred.</p>
<p>"Dont hate me too much, you might not have any memories of me but we go way back. Oh, the food is ready. Lena, bring her to the table.</p>
<p>"Will do!"</p>
<p>The trap named the Redeemer was essentially a steel sphere which fasted the prey's limbs to each end. It also had the added bonus of being able to transport the target by rolling around.</p>
<p>"Good, now let's eat first since the meat is ready and we wouldn't want it to get cold."</p>
<p>Although I didn't know what kind of meat it was, I had sliced it into steaks and served it with a special sauce. We also had a vegetable salad to accompany the meal.</p>
<p>"I made this for us with deep care. Lena, please help her enjoy the meal.</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>A robotic arm emerged from his spheric prison and brought a piece of steak to her mouth.</p>
<p>"Oh right, we'd have to remove the gag. Okay, be sure not to make any loud noises now, alright?"</p>
<p>However it was clear by the look in her eyes that he wouldn't comply.</p>
<p>"Lena prepare an array to cancel and sounds from escaping."</p>
<p>"Will do."</p>
<p>"Help! Help! A psychopath broke in! It's an emergency!"</p>
<p>As soon as the gag was removed she began to cry out for help. I paid her no mind and focused on eating the steak before me, aware that her shouts would never go more than 2 meters at which point the array Lena had installed would stop the sound in its tracks.</p>
<p>"Stop wasting your energy and start eating. We have a lot to talk about."</p>
<p>Finally, after a long period of shouting, she had given up. She seemed to have resigned herself to her fate.</p>
<p>"So your name is now Noren?"</p>
<p>"How do you know my name, are you a stalker?"</p>
<p>"Stalker huh? Well I guess that isn't entirely wrong."</p>
<p>"What is it that you want? Money? My authorization key is in my drawer beside my bed. If you take it you can have access to all my savings.</p>
<p>"Money? Have I ever needed that? Even if I did, I wouldn't come take it from you."</p>
<p>"So what then, my life?"</p>
<p>"Come on, I would never"</p>
<p>"Then...."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Is it my body then?"</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha! You're cracking me up, taking me for some kind of rapist."</p>
<p>"Then just why have you done this to me!?"</p>
<p>I stared at her and spoke seriously.</p>
<p>"What is it that you remember, what is your oldest memory?"</p>
<p>"What... my memories? Why do you want to know that?"</p>
<p>Noren's face showed that she was embarrassed.</p>
<p>"I was informed that you would periodically wipe out your own memory, is that so?"</p>
<p>"How do you...."</p>
<p>"Well, I've looked into you. Every 10 years you have your memory wiped."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>"Not answering is the same as acquiescing."</p>
<p>"..."</p>
<p>Her expression was once again that of embarrassment.</p>
<p>"Do you not know how long you have been living for?"</p>
<p>"How can you possibly know that I can't remember?"</p>
<p>"Well, It was my wish that you could live out your days in hiding, but it seems that someone has already been meddling, Why don't you guys show yourselves!"</p>
<p>Kukkung</p>
<p>Before I could even finish, two beings with large gray wings materialized before me.</p>
<p>"Master Johra, why didn't you tell us that you had arrived!"</p>
<p>"Dummies, how could you say that when you are the ones which were supposed to picked me up."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 138</p>
<p>"We didn't know that you had already arrived."</p>
<p>"What... that isn't even a good lie. Your subordinate Killion was waiting to receive me, how could you not have known?"</p>
<p>Sha shook her head.</p>
<p>"Did Killion truly meet up with you? How strange, it was not yet time for you to arrive."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"You've arrived 1,000 years earlier than what was predicted."</p>
<p>Sha then spoke with L in her unique fashion which didn't produce any sound.</p>
<p>"Oh, so that's what happened."</p>
<p>"What do you mean?"</p>
<p>"Killion must have been waiting there for thousands of years in advance."</p>
<p>"Then I arrived earlier than expected, why is that?"</p>
<p>"I hadn't expected the time flux to have shifted due to your influence. Abaddon has also been influenced by such change, which is why she loses her memory from time to time."</p>
<p>"Ah, so the alignment of the time flux is off... will this civilization suffer from my presence as well?"</p>
<p>"Yes. You put all of your knowledge into Skyfather, but after 6. 6 billion years time too much has changed from your reality and the present. Also, can I release this?"</p>
<p>"Will Abaddon not resist?"</p>
<p>"It is okay. Abaddon's memories were sealed a long time ago. Now she only knows herself as Norn."</p>
<p>"Just who are you guys, and what are you doing in my house!"</p>
<p>L let Norn out of the Redemption prison and she was now trembling in the corner of her living room.</p>
<p>"By the way, how did you discover Norn's location? Sha and I were surprised since even Metatron hasn't found a clue regarding Abaddon's whereabouts."</p>
<p>"Well, I have my own secret method. Have you guys been protecting Norn's identity this whole time?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, if Abaddon were to be resurrected then it would be quite troublesome for us. Still, I don't think we can evade Metatron's reach forever."</p>
<p>Simply by looking at Norn I had fully grasped the current situation.</p>
<p>Skyfather was the vessel for Abaddon's powers, so if he were to meet with Norn then the was a strong possibility that Abaddon would resurrect. Similarly, should Metatron find Norn's whereabouts, he would go all out to ensure Abaddon's resurrection. For this reason Sha and L had to hide Norn from Metatron.</p>
<p>"What are your plans now, Johra? Oh, is that steak? It looks delicious."</p>
<p>"Uh... eat up, I prepared it for you guys."</p>
<p>"Oh, it's steak cooked by the strongest god in all the universes! Regardless of the taste, it's unique!"</p>
<p>L rushed towards the dinner table and tore into the meat. Sha however sat gently at the table and with the fork and knife ate her steak following proper etiquette.</p>
<p>As I watched the two enjoy the meal, Norn however remained wary and hugging a pillow on the sofa; however it had to be said that seeing our bizarre actions, her fear had lessened to a certain extent.</p>
<p>"Norn, why don't you come and eat as well."</p>
<p>"Do you think I'd eat food served by a strange burglar?"</p>
<p>"Norn don't speak about things you can't possibly understand. You'd best come and eat this steak, such opportunities don't come very often."</p>
<p>L chastised Norn while steak sauce dripped from the corner of his mouth. However Norn simply shook her head.</p>
<p>"Why are you here? If it isn't for money, then is there some kind of grudge between us? If that is the case then I can only apologize since I can't recall anything."</p>
<p>"It isn't a grudge."</p>
<p>Norn replied with a frown, "then why did you imprison me in that terrifying construct."</p>
<p>"Isn't that because you ran away from me?"</p>
<p>"It's normal to flee when a stranger is pursuing you!"</p>
<p>Norn's voice grew louder.</p>
<p>"But it was you who threw me to the ground."</p>
<p>"Tha... that was just pure instinct! If I was rude I'll apologize, but you were the one who grabbed my sleeve out of nowhere so I think you're the one in the wrong."</p>
<p>"Johra, did you really grab her sleeve?"</p>
<p>L asked with a mischievous face. They of course already knew all about the situation since they had been keeping watch over her, and were only trying to make me lose face.</p>
<p>"Shup up, I was thinking of way to strike up a conversation with her and it seemed like the easiest option."</p>
<p>"It's quite shameful to suddenly grab a woman's sleeve in a dark alley!"</p>
<p>"Right, I think you should excuse yourself, Johra."</p>
<p>"Oh, L you are mighty feisty today, as I remember you had a certain debt towards me...."</p>
<p>"Ah ha ha... did I? Anyways, I guess I'll eat Norn's steak as she doesn't seem to want it."</p>
<p>As I put L back into his place, Sha continued to eat peacefully.</p>
<p>"Anyways, so miss Norn, I came here to talk with you."</p>
<p>I told her politely, but she remained reserved. Of course it was understandable since I was someone who had been waiting in her house in ambush.</p>
<p>"What business do you have with me? And after we are done talking will you leave me alone?</p>
<p>"Leaving... we are quite close after all."</p>
<p>"Johra, Sha is able to restore her memory for a short period of time, do you think that would help?"</p>
<p>Sha paused her eating and nodded.</p>
<p>"Okay, then when you finish eating I'll have to ask for that favor."</p>
<p>"Sha nodded back and then went back to eating her steak.</p>
<p>"I can remember the memories I've lost?"</p>
<p>"Well, you lost a lot of memories, but at least Sha can help you to better understand the situation."</p>
<p>"Truly?"</p>
<p>"It would only be temporary though."</p>
<p>"It's enough, I want to know about my past and why it is my memory keeps being reset.</p>
<p>I could feel the pain in Norn's eyes, perhaps she would hold a grudge after knowing the full story.</p>
<p>'What if you were to learn that your current situation was of your own choosing. Living a life of lost memories through the past 6. 6 billion years.... Would you still be okay with it I wonder?'</p>
<p>Shortly after Sha finished her meal and wiped her mouth clean. After that she walked towards Norn.</p>
<p>"You're not going to do something strange like open my head, right?"</p>
<p>She asked with a nervous expression.</p>
<p>Without answering Sha simply stretch forth her arm and placed her hand on Norn's forehead</p>
<p>"Aaaah! It hurts! Dammit! Just why am I like this? Have I truly been living such pathetic lives? Johra what have I done to deserve such treatment!"</p>
<p>Abaddon's fiery personality had awakened and she was shouting in indignation after learning of all the suffering she had endured over the years.</p>
<p>"You're fine Abaddon, just calm down."</p>
<p>"Calm down my ass! Dammit!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 139</p>
<p>"Ugh my head! It's quite taxing to be trapped inside the body of such an inferior organism. Wait, didn't you come back early, Johra?"</p>
<p>Abaddon was clutching her head in pain as she asked me.</p>
<p>"I suppose I did, have you been doing well, Abaddon?"</p>
<p>"As you can see, with the Time flux all in disarray, one can barely call it living."</p>
<p>"I'm sorry to hear that."</p>
<p>"No need to be sorry, simply upholding the promise between us."</p>
<p>"So you haven't forgotten?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, why else would I be enduring this pain, over and over again?"</p>
<p>"Have you felt something, Abaddon?"</p>
<p>"The thing as you talked about? The change I should experience after all this time?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>I nodded back to Abaddon. Sha had stepped to the side and was listening to our conversation, while L was still focused on eating his steak.</p>
<p>"Sigh* Well..."</p>
<p>Abaddon had a blank look as she stared at the ceiling.</p>
<p>"Did you not feel something, Abaddon?"</p>
<p>"6. 6 billion years, its a time period that beyond imagination. You have no idea."</p>
<p>"I suppose I don't."</p>
<p>At first it was basically a long and free vacation. That was the case for the first ten million years or so. The world was simple, with nothing worth remembering or mentioning. However, after the first billion years, Skyfather began spreading life across the universes. He needed to build an engine of Divine Grace in order to increase his strength."</p>
<p>"An engine of Divine Grace? Isn't that what results from the interactions between living beings?"</p>
<p>"Yes. Basically, Skyfather continued to play the role of the leader of gods amongs the newly developed ratmen. He began experimenting with space, using the science and magic which we bestowed on him, as if he were a real God."</p>
<p>"It looks like quite a few things have happened then."</p>
<p>"Right, as an experiment, he caused the extinction of a few million creatures. Sometimes he would fuse other creatures' powers with new hosts. he wasn't so much a God, as a researcher with a God's power.</p>
<p>"Really, extinction?"</p>
<p>"The purpose of developing and pushing the boundaries of science was all to develop new weapons for war. Blowing up planets and wiping out civilizations all for sake of some tests. He definitely committed a lot of these actions."</p>
<p>"Dammit, did the Skyfather truly do that?"</p>
<p>"I can suppose that he was beginning to feel strange emotions, and this was his manner of testing how the results affected him. At the very least all his actions were in the pursuit of one thing."</p>
<p>"What is that one thing?"</p>
<p>"The purpose you had originally given me which is to find a value to my existence."</p>
<p>"But why would he experiment with life in such a way? Somehow I don't think that this will lead to the future which I came from."</p>
<p>Abaddon shook her head.</p>
<p>"These are in fact necessary sacrifices which will result in the exact future which you're from, so I can understand Skyfather's intentions. He doing all this to ensure your future."</p>
<p>"So all this deaths are just necessary sacrifices?"</p>
<p>"Right, for the moment, he will focus on defeating Metatron, but once that's out of the way he will surely erase all forms of life save for that planet you came from. Something about activating a Erasing Code which would wipe out the genetic code of all mortal life.</p>
<p>"That's insane! Sure, I feel that my future is important, but to sacrifice all forms of life...."</p>
<p>"Johra, with regards to the future you came from, this current moment is naturally its past. Your reality might entirely disappear if this present time doesn't follow a very specific course. In fact, deviating from said course would even put all the universes in peril, returning to the endless cycle of death and rebirth."</p>
<p>"Then is there no other solution other than going forward with Skyfather's plan for mass extinction? If we were to put a stop to him, would we be back to square one?"</p>
<p>"There might be, but besides you there has been no one who could modify the time continuum. And even when you did so, it received a critical injury resulting in things being all out of whack.</p>
<p>"What... so in the end it is once again my fault?"</p>
<p>"Of course, who else but you could travel across time to put a stop to me and help create Skyfather?"</p>
<p>I had no response.</p>
<p>I had obviously been the cause behind all this. Still, even though the methods were not at all what I'd condone, I didn't have a better solution myself.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes in order to organise my thoughts.</p>
<p>'Was it really justified to ensure the reality which I was familiar with at the expense of the countless lives currently in this universe? On one hand I couldn't possibly give up on my beloved Viezda, my daughter Veznos as well as Valenor. But on the other hand, was it really okay to do so at the cost of so many lives?'</p>
<p>Both were options which any sane man couldn't choose between.</p>
<p>"Enough, I'm Johra! It's fate for my future to be safe and harmonious, the rest be damned! I'll be selfish about this."</p>
<p>"Your thinking is actually quite immature"</p>
<p>Clap! Clap! Clap!</p>
<p>Sha gave a half-hearted applause and a small smile. Hearing that, L turn and said to me.</p>
<p>"Sha said that her thinking is in line with yours. You've always done whatever you wanted and that's the reason why we are where we are. She said she's looking forward to seeing the end which you've promised us."</p>
<p>"What promise are you talking about?"</p>
<p>Sha nodded her head and they spoke between themselves.</p>
<p>"Sha says that Abaddon will soon lose her memories. Umm... I think it would be better for Sha and myself to separate Abaddon's personality in order to better support Johra."</p>
<p>"Huh? What does that even mean?"</p>
<p>"Abaddon's memory is reset from time to time, so it's hard for her to help you return."</p>
<p>"Oh, so there's no chance of me succeeding alone?"</p>
<p>Sha shook her head then communicated once more with El.</p>
<p>"She says that with Johra's current ability, not to mention Skyfather, even Metatron would be to much to handle. That wouldn't be the case however if we split Abaddon's power and help you,that way we might chance to win...."</p>
<p>"Then can you return everything after the deeds been done?"</p>
<p>Sha shook her head.</p>
<p>"That's a problem then."</p>
<p>Sha whispered to L again</p>
<p>"Don't worry about that, despite Abaddon originally being a part of us, even if we were to split her between u,s our memories would still return when the time came.</p>
<p>Sha's eyes showed that she was determined to see it through and El would always back her up; however Abaddon was frowning.</p>
<p>"Me join with you two? Are you crazy? Are you trying to start Ragnarok prematurely?"</p>
<p>"Ragnarok?"</p>
<p>My eyes lit up at the mention of that familiar word.</p>
<p>Sha and El communicated between themselves, nodding to each other in agreement.</p>
<p>"Fine, let's begin Ragnarok."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>Abaddon an I replied in unison.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 140</p>
<p>"Ragnarok? Did I hear wrong? Abbadon?"</p>
<p>"I think I heard it too."</p>
<p>"Are you crazy, L?"</p>
<p>"Please listen until the end, I was about to explain it."</p>
<p>"Okay, go ahead."</p>
<p>L closed his eyes as he attempted to organize his thoughts, also receiving some input from Sha.</p>
<p>"Exactly...."</p>
<p>"A miniature Ragnarok. Originally, Ragnarok is a phenomenon caused by Omega. It uses Anti-Higgs particles, which are the antithesis of Higgs particles termed by humans, to turn all matter in the universes into energy.</p>
<p>"Higgs, Anti-Higgs... what the hell are you talking about?"</p>
<p>"Well, I might need to further explain the process of creation and destruction of the universes. So you should already know that we are in charge of the Alpha, and Abbadon is the Omega, right?"</p>
<p>"Yes... I'm aware."</p>
<p>"And the positrons which you create, Johra, they don't normally exist in the universe, right?"</p>
<p>"I guess, if positron were to form naturally, then matter would disappear and the universe would cease to exist."</p>
<p>"Then do you know what occurs when a positron encounters an electron?"</p>
<p>"Energy...?"</p>
<p>"Right, once they are paired, they disappear and turn into energy. This is a fundamental part of the destruction of the universes.</p>
<p>"Yes, I've used their explosive properties to great effect over the years."</p>
<p>"Okay, but what if the opposite happens, and energy is turned back into positrons and electrons?"</p>
<p>"Wouldn't it use up the energy and create matter?"</p>
<p>"That's right, and the particles which are formed from such a reaction are known as Higgs particles. Also, their antithesis are Anti-Higgs particles, which is what Abbadon controls when she turns matter into energy as the Omega."</p>
<p>"So you're saying that the Higgs particles are the power of Alpha and the Anti-Higgs the power of the Omega...?"</p>
<p>"Something like that, just that we don't control the particles themselves, but rather the larger picture. Omega is in charge of reduction of matter into energy, while us Alpha take energy and turn it into matter. In that way the universes are constantly recycled and don't fade away.</p>
<p>"What does that have to do with Ragnarok though?"</p>
<p>"Ragnarok refers to the Omega's role of recycling matter into energy."</p>
<p>"Not annihilation, but rather recycling?"</p>
<p>"Right, because it is a process which can be restored."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that."</p>
<p>"Well, everything which had been turned into energy, can once again become matter."</p>
<p>"Something about that feels off."</p>
<p>"Why, what's wrong?"</p>
<p>"If complete restoration was possible, then wouldn't that cycle continue on for eternity?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"So basically, the fact that this endless cycle has been broken is something that should never have occured? An example of that is the fact that you two were split up as a result, right?"</p>
<p>"Indeed."</p>
<p>L answered with a bright smile.</p>
<p>'Why is he so happy, isn't this one of those paradoxes?'</p>
<p>"So how can we explain the current phenomenon?"</p>
<p>Sha and I as the Alpha, and Abbadon as the Omega have overseen countless reincarnations of the universes. We were trapped in that endless cycle when Johra arrived and put an end to it all.</p>
<p>"Uh... when exactly did I do this? In the future?"</p>
<p>"That's right, this would normally not have been possible, but the future broke the chain of continuity."</p>
<p>"What... just how did I?"</p>
<p>L shook his head.</p>
<p>"It's unclear, I only know that Johra and Sha have made some secret arrangement in the future.</p>
<p>"An arrangement?"</p>
<p>I thought back to that promise, the one which had appeared in my dreams countless times. Finally there was a clue regarding it.</p>
<p>"With Sha? L, ask Sha about this promise we supposedly made!"</p>
<p>"Sha proceed to shake her head and silently communicate with L."</p>
<p>"To this date Sha hasn't informed me of the details of your promise. She says that you'll find out all about it in the next cycle of the universe.</p>
<p>"So I can only hear about it next time... damn, I can't do anything without any clues!"</p>
<p>I looked up and stared into Sha's eyes.</p>
<p>"Sha said, you don't need to worry it. So far you been keeping your promise well."</p>
<p>"Phuuu.. why does it feel like I'm getting trolled."</p>
<p>"Jorha hush, L, tell me what this miniature Ragnarok is all about", Abbadon spoke up.</p>
<p>"In order to realign the time axis, a reduction of matter is required."</p>
<p>"Turning matter into energy? So in the end Abbadon, as the Omega...."</p>
<p>"No, when Abbadon is fully released as the Omega the she will completely wipe all matter from the universes, we can't have that right now.</p>
<p>"Then how?"</p>
<p>Sha and I will fuse with a part of her. According to her theory, we should then have some measure of control over Anti-Higgs particles, at least enough to ensure a controlled Ragnarok."</p>
<p>"So you'll be selective about what matter you turn into energy?"</p>
<p>"Right, by personally dealing with all the time paradoxes and turning them into energy, the universes should be realigned."</p>
<p>"Kind of like some time capsule to set us on the right course."</p>
<p>Finally the process had become clear to me. Of course, due to that the fear of the word Ragnarok, stemming from the Northern European Mythology was no more, seeing as I now knew that it was but one part of the endless recycling of the universes.</p>
<p>Although Ragnarok did indeed cause the destruction of all things, A rebirth would occur at the hands of the surviving High Gods.</p>
<p>"I have a question, do you have complete control as to how you use the miniature Ragnarok?"</p>
<p>"Right, but...."</p>
<p>"But?"</p>
<p>Both Abbadon and I fired back immediately.</p>
<p>"If we don't fuse together, then we won't gain the ability to reduce matter into energy."</p>
<p>"Then you guys will end up playing a key role."</p>
<p>"Yes, we also need a place to house the matter that we reduce into energy, a place that isn't affected by time."</p>
<p>"Some kind of storage space?"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>Sha and El nodded back solemnly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 141</p>
<p>"If the worst case were to arise, wouldn't you not be able to restore to your true selves?"</p>
<p>I asked L.</p>
<p>"If we were to die while being fused, we wouldn't be able to be reborn until the universe has been restored."</p>
<p>"Restored?"</p>
<p>"Oh, didn't you know? All vessels of Divine Grave are restored after death, just in another universe cycle. This is all attributed to an individual's Divine Grace, I suppose humans call this Soul? Every soul is connected to both the Alpha and Omega and undergoes multiple cycles of reduction and restoration."</p>
<p>"There isn't any case where they are completely wiped out?"</p>
<p>"I can't be sure, but once Abbadon fully awakes as the Omega, if we were to undergo a cycle of reduction as the universe is now, I can't predict the outcome.</p>
<p>"Well it seems that I've caused quite a lot of problems."</p>
<p>"Johra can be considered as an exception among exceptions."</p>
<p>Sha chuckled, before giving me a meaningful look.</p>
<p>'Now I'm just more curious as to what our promise was. '</p>
<p>Sha and L then proceeded to take hold of Abbadon hand.</p>
<p>"What are you doing? Are you trying to fuse without even getting my permission?"</p>
<p>"Abbadon, we were originally one, you might not remember but just embrace it."</p>
<p>"Damn, everything that will happen in the future will be on you."</p>
<p>Abbadon bit her lip before extending her hand.</p>
<p>"Then until next time, Johra."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"We'll meet again soon."</p>
<p>"Wait up, we aren't done yet!"</p>
<p>"Bye we're leaving!"</p>
<p>Swooosh!</p>
<p>They all turned into a blinding light and vanished before my very eyes.</p>
<p>"Ughh! This L and Sha! How dare they! If I tell them to wait up they should listen to me!"</p>
<p>My crazy shouts in this empty living room fell on deaf ears.</p>
<p>"What am I supposed to do next. My plan was to first make a deal with Skyfather and then meet Abbadon and get her help to take care of Megatron, but now...."</p>
<p>"Johra, Skyfather's fleet has been detected, they are about 1 AU out. He must have decoded the our teleportation log."</p>
<p>"Oh right, there was that, I also forgot that i left that code for Skyfather to come here. Just what am I supposed to do now? Now that Abbadon is gone, how am I supposed to make a deal with Skyfather? Ughh!"</p>
<p>"I recommend fleeing at once, Johra."</p>
<p>Lena was right, I couldn't meet face to face with SKyfather now that my leverage in making a deal had disappeared.</p>
<p>"Lena, set up a teleportation array!"</p>
<p>"On it!"</p>
<p>Quaaaaaaaang</p>
<p>The very next moment a flash of lightning appeared in the house and the scent of burnt oil filled my nostrils. The lightning had effectively melted the surrounding walls and the emergency fire alarms and sprinklers had gone off.</p>
<p>Pazic! Pazic</p>
<p>Hovering before me was a giant creature wrapped in large gray wings.</p>
<p>"Johra, that's one of his Angels. Judging by its 13 wings, it must be a pretty high level Cherubim."</p>
<p>"Dammit, they're already here. How about the magic array?"</p>
<p>"Ready to go."</p>
<p>"Then let's get out of here."</p>
<p>Kuuhmm!</p>
<p>A familiar shockwave spread out.</p>
<p>"Null Magic field?"</p>
<p>The large angel looked down at me emotionlessly, like statue looking down on the world.</p>
<p>"I might have suffered under this before, but no longer."</p>
<p>Extending my will to the Null Magic Field, I completely negate it.</p>
<p>'Reject!'</p>
<p>The Null Magic Field disappeared just as quickly as it had formed.</p>
<p>The Angel's previous stone faced expression became contorted as it pulled out a large flaming sword.</p>
<p>"Johra, the Teleportation Array is ready to use at any time."</p>
<p>"In a bit, I can't simply run away without any payback."</p>
<p>"The temperature of that fire sword is close to 100 million degrees, even the Rohim's shield..."</p>
<p>Huaaa!</p>
<p>Before Lena could even finish here thought, the angel swung her superheated plasma sword towards me.</p>
<p>'Freeze!'</p>
<p>My will wrapped itself around the flaming sword. I truly hoped that the Sephiroth network which I had planted and grown across the universes over the past 6. 6 billion years would work as advertised.</p>
<p>Fortunately it also extended to the 100 million degrees plasma sword, and my commands were absolute, overriding all else.</p>
<p>Both magical and divine powers were using the network to interact with matter across the universes. (With some exceptions)</p>
<p>As soon as my will reached out to the Sephiroth network and interacted with its primal mana, all magic and divine powers were in the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>"Ancient Demon! You are as powerful as foretold! In the name of the Almighty Skyfather, I, the Angel of Light Uriel, shall banish you from whence you came."</p>
<p>Discarding its burning sword which had been frozen in mid air, it pulled out a huge spear.</p>
<p>"It doesn't look like some regular spear... could it be the Lance of Longinus?"</p>
<p>"Ancient Demon! Since you know the origins of this lance, kneel before its sacred name, Hallelujah!"</p>
<p>"Shit, I really hope it isn't that lance."</p>
<p>Wharrrr</p>
<p>Sparks appeared and danced dangerously along the Lance of Longinus.</p>
<p>"Not good Johra, even I can't get a reading as to how hot it is, it might really be dangerous this time around."</p>
<p>"Hey, believe in me, I will counterattack this time around. Can one even kill a god with that Longinus?"</p>
<p>"Yes, now receive my blow and repent you wicked Demon!"</p>
<p>"Damn, just what way is that of speaking to your elders, when you think about it I'm your grandfather!"</p>
<p>"Have you said your final prayers? Confess, as I'll now erase your existence!"</p>
<p>"Hm... this Skyfather, later I'll have to have a talk with him about his upbringing abilities. Talking to their grandfather in this way...."</p>
<p>The very next moment, just as Uriel began her strike with the Lance of Longinus, I felt time around me come to a stop.</p>
<p>"This...!"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 142</p>
<p>Suaak!</p>
<p>A dimensional space crack materialized before me and a white arm began to reach out form it.</p>
<p>Time itself had been slowed down to such a level that only 0. 0001 seconds had passed.</p>
<p>Chiiiiiic</p>
<p>As the crack began to widen, a transparent white, humanoid creature stepped out of it. Although this being moved quite slowly, it was much faster than everything happening around it.</p>
<p>Uriel's Lance of Longinus had yet to advance a single centimeter as this white being took stock of the room.</p>
<p>The reason I could even see any movement was due to Lena's spacetime trap.</p>
<p>Although my movements weren't able to match the speed of my thoughts, with the trap I was at least conscious.</p>
<p>'Hm, am I able to cast a spell in this moment? Freeze!'</p>
<p>I pushed my will towards the Sephiroth network.</p>
<p>Chawwaaa</p>
<p>According to my will, everything around me dropped to absolute zero, as it spread to this new arrival</p>
<p>Pak!</p>
<p>However, with but a swish of its hand, my will was dispersed.</p>
<p>'Ah, is that his Brainwashing ability? He's managed to even confuse the Sephiroth network. '</p>
<p>Yes, the being that appeared from space was Metatron. His powers were space-time manipulation, as well as Mind control.</p>
<p>There was also one additional power, which Makina suspected to be some sort of magic copying ability.</p>
<p>Metatron quickly approached me and inspected me thoroughly. It was obvious that he was quite interested in a being which had for the first time managed to counterattack while under the influence of his time stop.</p>
<p>"Hmm... what are you? I don't think it was Skyfather's little toy over there that managed to attack me, so was it your doing?"</p>
<p>Metatron proceeded to touch and inspect my entire body.</p>
<p>'Ugh! This guy is seriously putting me in a bad mood. '</p>
<p>As his cold hands touched me all over, he then proceed to tear one of my arms off.</p>
<p>"Hmm... not quite a human, not a monster either, what a strange fellow."</p>
<p>Metatron then brought his finger to my now severed arm and tasted my blood.</p>
<p>"How interesting, I'll take this arm with me as a memento. Oh, by the way, have you seen any sign of Abbadon? It's the first time in a while that I've gotten so close to her."</p>
<p>Ignoring the incredible pain, I push my will to connect with the Sephiroth network.</p>
<p>'Accelerate! Accelerate! Accelerate!'</p>
<p>All the particles in the room except for a certain area around Metatron were sped up, and I was able to wrest control of time from Metatron.</p>
<p>Cough! That bastard!"</p>
<p>Since our roles were now reversed, it was Metatron which was frozen stiff. Still, I learned the hard way that a God's blood was golden as it gushed out from my severed shoulder.</p>
<p>Snatching my arm back from him, I placed it up against my shoulder and began to heal it back up. It had taken me quite a few painful seconds before I had managed to connect myself with the Sephiroth network.</p>
<p>"Hmph!... once my arm is fully healed I'll take care of this one. Lena, prepare some Magic Traps.</p>
<p>"Understood!"</p>
<p>After first securting him in 10,000 layers of Magic Traps, I then proceed to cut up his body into different pieces and surrounded them with Rohim's Shield. Despite having gone this far, I was confident that Metatron wouldn't die, even if time flow were to be restored.</p>
<p>"Did you say that it was the head which cast all of the magic?"</p>
<p>"Right, according to Makina the rest of his body only served as an amplification device, where as the actual thought process and magic casting occured in the head. There were several instances where Skyfather wasn't able to figure that out and suffered a loss because of it.</p>
<p>"Good, let's take a break then and head to that secure area which Makina created."</p>
<p>According to Makina's suggestion, I split his body into six different pieces, each with their own set of magical restraints which made it impossible for them to recover. The head however had its own specialised restraints which blocked it from accessing magic.</p>
<p>Quaazzic Quazic</p>
<p>Less than a second had passed in the space surrounding Metatron. Still, now that regular time was restored, since the head couldn't interact with any magic he had no way to escape his predicament.</p>
<p>"Okay, we're finished here, Lena, activate the teleportation array."</p>
<p>"Alright!"</p>
<p>Shhoong</p>
<p>The six pieces of Metatron which had been successfully restrained were brought back to Makina's secured space.</p>
<p>"Welcome back Johra! It seems you've successfully caught Metatron!"</p>
<p>I heard Makina's bright voice upon arrival.</p>
<p>"Yes, thanks to your feedback I was able to easily secure him. I'll now take just the head with me to the secure room."</p>
<p>Leaving Makina behind with the rest of his body parts, I brought Metatron's head with me into the room.</p>
<p>The secure room was a cubic space surrounded by thick black walls and guarded by millions of magic spells which blocked out any known forces.</p>
<p>Suoh!</p>
<p>I removed the gag which prevented him from speaking.</p>
<p>"How dare you do this to me! Do you think all this can hold me indefinitely!"</p>
<p>I stared emotionlessly at the head which I had placed on the table before me. He was unable to cast any spells despite being able to speak, so I knew how frustrating it must have been for him.</p>
<p>"Why, do you think you can escape from here?"</p>
<p>"Even if I can't right now, as long as I live I'll find a way to get my revenge!"</p>
<p>"Ah~ I know what you're up to so don't even think about it."</p>
<p>"You bastard! Stop saying nonsense and just kill me already!"</p>
<p>"Oh, so I'm the bad guy now? Well there are two reasons why I won't be killing you, the first is that you will simply be resurrected upon death. The second is that I know that you can copy the power of your killer."</p>
<p>"How did you learn that?"</p>
<p>Metatron asked sheepishly, like a kid caught trying to steal from the cookie jar.</p>
<p>"Just some information I've acquired over 100 million years of analysis."</p>
<p>"Are you one of Skyfather's minions?"</p>
<p>I made an awkward expression as I explained the situation.</p>
<p>"Actually, Skyfather and I aren't on the best of terms."</p>
<p>I saw the fiery anger in Metatron's eyes as he looks at me searchingly, attempting to uncover my identity.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 143</p>
<p>"Naturally I have my reasons for doing what I did."</p>
<p>Metatron stared at me, waiting for me to continue.</p>
<p>"Of course, I couldn't simply leave you alone."</p>
<p>"Why not, I don't even know who you are."</p>
<p>"You might not know me, but I know everything about you."</p>
<p>"What is your name?"</p>
<p>"You don't need to know that."</p>
<p>"Why are you being so petty as to not even tell me your name? If it's some kind of revenge which you want, then you can go ahead and kill me."</p>
<p>"Enough, stop wasting your time trying to trick me into killing you. We will be here together in this place for quite some time."</p>
<p>"A long time?"</p>
<p>"Yes, now that you mention it, we might as well make ourselves comfortable. Lena, help me out. Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created a comfy five-seater sofa and a coffee table.</p>
<p>Lena, send me a design for a TV that can only receive signals, and have it connected to Makina's feed.</p>
<p>"Alright!"</p>
<p>"Lena whipped up a design for a large 100 inch television, which I used to create the TV and hung it on the wall.</p>
<p>"Hmm... it needs some kind of power source."</p>
<p>"I'll send you the designs for a mini-reactor, give me a moment."</p>
<p>Shortly after the design appeared on my cornea allowing me to materialize it.</p>
<p>Buuu —!</p>
<p>As soon as the reactor was powered up, I hooked it up to the TV and sank into the couch, placing Metatron's head beside me.</p>
<p>"Oh, I guess this situation calls for some popcorn. Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I stared at the new TV as I tossed some popcorn into my mouth.</p>
<p>"Just what is that?"</p>
<p>"This is just a relay of all current major events going on across the universes. In the top left corner you can see your fleet engaging with Skyfather's and in the bottom right is the creation of a certain time array."</p>
<p>"Why are you showing me this?"</p>
<p>"No particular reason, it's just that from now on you and I have some things we have to sort out. Plus, watching a movie alone isn't as fun.</p>
<p>"What? Am I supposed to be your companion now?"</p>
<p>"You should thank me instead, I could have stuck in the ground in some remote area. Well, in truth I was a bit worried that you'd find your way out, so I'll be keeping a close eye on you.</p>
<p>I had already decided to take a step back and simply watch the events play out. In the past I had directly intervened too often, which ended up backfiring and negatively affecting future events, so my choice this time around was one of minimal interference. "Why are you doing all this? I can understand Skyfather hating me since I kept persecuting him regarding Abbadon's resurrection, but I don't understand what your connection to her is."</p>
<p>"You can think of it as me doing service for everyone's future."</p>
<p>"That can't be the case, since Abbadon's purpose is the destruction of all the universes."</p>
<p>"Nonsense Metatron, her purpose is the reduction of matter to energy, not its destruction."</p>
<p>"... How did you know?"</p>
<p>"Did you really think I wouldn't even know that much?"</p>
<p>"I think I'm beginning to understand just who you are. You're an Ancient God aren't you?"</p>
<p>"Well I haven't been around for all that long... oh look over there! Skyfather's army has found your fleet's headquarter."</p>
<p>"There no need to look, I'm already aware that my fleet can't stand up to Skyfather's without my presence."</p>
<p>"Yup, those gray flies seem to be mopping the floor with your ships."</p>
<p>"They would be very angry to hear you call them gray flies, they think of themselves as God's Messengers."</p>
<p>"I know, but in the end they're just flies."</p>
<p>"It seems that Skyfather hasn't found out."</p>
<p>"Oh, did you have some hidden agenda?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I set something up with a subordinate of mine, Skyfather will win but at the same time it could be considered as his loss."</p>
<p>"Oh so it was like that? It seems that all is going according to plan, well done Killion."</p>
<p>"What, you know Killion?"</p>
<p>"Just how do you think it is that you were able to find me in the first place?"</p>
<p>"I don't know... were you the one who informed Killion?"</p>
<p>"Bingo! Did you trace back the signal from Killion's necklace? I had been pinging it occasionally in order to let slip my location."</p>
<p>"Why would you... oh, so it was a trap."</p>
<p>"Right, information regarding Abbadon's location was something both you and Skyfather desired."</p>
<p>"Was your goal to catch me?"</p>
<p>"Well, in truth I was looking to trap both you and Skyfather, but since the latter isn't able to get around anymore, I settled for just you."</p>
<p>"You used Killion?"</p>
<p>"Right, after all Skyfather's body has been deteriorating by the day."</p>
<p>"Yes, I've received the same intel. By my estimates his would have stopped functioning in 1 million years time. My plan was to extract his memory from that scrap of metal and fuse it with Abbadon, that was until you interfered."</p>
<p>"It looks good on paper, but in actuality it wouldn't have worked because Skyfather would have self-destructed before being captured."</p>
<p>"Are you saying that you were the one who designed the weapon Killion brought to me?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's in fact a certain magic array which will trap Skyfather in time, effectively putting him in limbo. Although he won't be destroyed, he won't be able to have any effect on the universe around him."</p>
<p>"So you were tricking me in order to have me trap Skyfather on your behalf. What a scary existence you are. You foresaw and planned for every possible scenario and countermove.</p>
<p>"Oh it isn't such a big deal. Just some assumptions and planning, most of the calculations are done by a friend of mine who makes all the contingency plans."</p>
<p>"That's right! I'm Johra's secret weapon!"</p>
<p>Lena cried out so that only I could hear.</p>
<p>"Skyfather's ship was just caught by your Time Magic array, your planning abilities are truly scary."</p>
<p>"Yes, and now his entire ship will be caught in limbo for near eternity. Those pesky flies are attempting to wipe out your allies, but they'll find that their power alone will be insufficient to do so."</p>
<p>"Still, someday he will be released, those Angels will have evolved and new Gods will have appeared. You can't perfectly predict the future either."</p>
<p>"Oh I'm well aware of that, but it will buy us time to fix all the paradoxes which have been affecting the stability of the universes."</p>
<p>"Paradoxes?"</p>
<p>"Yea, I guess you can call them some inconsistencies which resulted due to some of my mistakes."</p>
<p>"Ah, I finally have a good idea of who you are."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 144</p>
<p>"You are that trash left over from the birth of the universes."</p>
<p>"Trash? Well that's a bit harsh, no?"</p>
<p>"Abbadon once mentioned that there was a certain unforeseen error which prevented her perfect return."</p>
<p>I wanted to immediately refute his words, but chose to first reflect in silence.</p>
<p>'I guess this is a good chance to learn more about what Abbadon has said about me. '</p>
<p>"An error?"</p>
<p>"Yes, some unforeseen error which was a failure of the Almighty himself, but looking back I'd say it wasn't so much an error as a piece of trash. Everything went wrong after your arrival, Abbadon lost her purpose and the Omega became corrupted."</p>
<p>"Trash? Corrupted?"</p>
<p>"Because of you, I've lost Abbadon whom I worship and no longer have proper duties to perform."</p>
<p>"You're referring to the freedom you had to pursue anything you'd like, was that a bad thing? If you think this is corruption, I'm not sure I can follow your logic."</p>
<p>"Abbadon was a pure being, the ultimate defender of purity in this universe, but you're the one who corrupted her, you're trash!"</p>
<p>"I see... but still isn't it a bit too much to call me trash?"</p>
<p>"No, that's exactly what you are. Some waste which has gathered near my pure Abbadon and corrupted her."</p>
<p>"What purity, Metatron? What you refer to as purity is simply the endless recycling of the universe. Doesn't this eternal repetition have no real meaning?"</p>
<p>"It represents a promise to return to its origins, to what's pure and you, Ancient God, have ruined it all! Removing the Omega from Abbadon and splitting Sha and L, you are the enemy of all living beings!"</p>
<p>Metatron shouted at me, his eyes burning with hate. I held his stare as I contemplated the words he just said.</p>
<p>"I don't know if that was done by the future me, but I've never taken such actions. My work now is simply on restoring the harmony in the universes which seems to currently be broken. Just look to the screen and have a look at my tireless work in restoring the harmony."</p>
<p>"Don't spout nonsense Ancient One, your very existence has deprived the universe of its rebirth. Time has now become an enemy of all the living."</p>
<p>"That's just a bunch of guesswork on your end. Actually, I don't need to explain myself to you, but I guess I have some free time."</p>
<p>"I'd like to see you come up with an excuse for this universal crime you've committed. I'll point out your very mistakes and force you to see the error in your actions."</p>
<p>"Hey, this is all just your opinion, I've never personally disrupted the harmony in the universe. I am simply a victim of fate which has led me down this path."</p>
<p>"That's where you are wrong, Ancient One. You destroyed the unity of the universe when you separated the Omega from Abbadon and split up Sha and L.</p>
<p>"Hey... that wasn't my doing! It was the future me!"</p>
<p>"That's where you are wrong, the present and future you are one and the same. The one who went back to the past, to the origins of the universe and the you who broke the harmony of this universe are the same person."</p>
<p>"No, that isn't true. I'm not the future me, would you believe me if I told you that in the future I won't take the same actions?"</p>
<p>"That isn't possible, you are destined to take the same path because the future has already been written in stone."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Unless the universe itself undergoes reduction and steps into a new cycle, your future will not change."</p>
<p>"Hey... are you saying that my future self will return once again to the past?"</p>
<p>"Right, unless the harmony in the universe is perfectly restored, then the future can't be changed, just like a arrow which had been shot can't be taken back. As it stands, you are on a one way ticket to mirror your future actions and become the God of Destruction which has brought and end to the universes."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>I was confused and somewhat embarrassed by Metatron's claims. I had long been burden by the actions of my future self, but rationalised it by telling myself that it was another person. Now, I learn that we are one and the same and that there isn't anything I can do about it.</p>
<p>"I can't put my faith in you, Ancient One. I have inherited my Space Time abilities from Abbadon, which is why I know where the universe is headed."</p>
<p>"Then is your claim that I can't change the future true?"</p>
<p>"Yes, regardless of your actions, the future has already been decided."</p>
<p>"What if it isn't the case?"</p>
<p>"I promise you that it is. If I turn out to be wrong then I will listen to any of your commands."</p>
<p>"Truly?"</p>
<p>"Ancient One, you have already made this promise with Sha, do you not remember?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"You've locked away these memories and experiences, but because of my close connection with Sha I'm aware of the promise between the two. Sha is the Light and I'm the Darkness, to sides to the same coin."</p>
<p>"Haven't you noticed that L is the mirror image of Orthotron?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"So the promise was about that...."</p>
<p>"Are you willing to go against your promise and fight your destiny by releasing me?"</p>
<p>After a moment of silence and reflection, I answered.</p>
<p>"Good, I'll choose to believe in you, but I have one condition."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"I have a certain future which I know and want to return to, it'll be your job to make sure that comes about. You will be ensuring a future occurs while I'll be trying to change it, deal?"</p>
<p>Metatron stared me with his eyes wide in surprise, before answering.</p>
<p>"I believe we have an agreement."</p>
<p>"Alright."</p>
<p>In this manner, the fate of the universe was now it its second act.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 145</p>
<p>"I'm a bit worried about you."</p>
<p>"It's fine, I never expected to win outright anyways."</p>
<p>I gave her a half hearted smile.</p>
<p>Metatron began healing before my very eyes.</p>
<p>I could see Metatron's smile as his body was restored to its peak condition.</p>
<p>"Old God, you are cruel to create a magic spell which can suppress my abilities."</p>
<p>"It isn't that much of a handicap since you still have mind control and your Space Time abilities."</p>
<p>"Fine, despite this not being a fair bet, I shall follow the course of history which you have provided me, but aside from that I will retain my free will.</p>
<p>"Good, then I shall accept this contract with you."</p>
<p>"Yes, I will likewise see this promise of mine through to the end."</p>
<p>Shoong</p>
<p>Metatron disappeared in order to fulfill his scripted actions which were based of the mythology Lena handed over. It was basically a timeline for the next 13. 3 billion years or so.</p>
<p>"Do I truly need to go to war now?"</p>
<p>"In this universe yes, but worry not there are far more universes than you can imagine. According to our calculation, there could have been a margin of error of one billion on Machina's end.</p>
<p>"Well... sure in this universe, but we don't know how many planets there are.</p>
<p>"Right, but there are so many worlds under Machina's influence that the odds are on your side."</p>
<p>"Okay, then just follow my plan"</p>
<p>"Then wouldn't there be a risk of Johra's existence disappearing?"</p>
<p>"No, I'll return. That has already been set in stone."</p>
<p>"I can't understand why it is you make so many of these personal sacrifices in order to maintain that future of yours."</p>
<p>"Perhaps one day you will also think the same way Lena. For now, begin the preparations."</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>Lena along with Machina prepared a large magic array. It had an unprecedented size, boasting a 2 km diameter, looking like one of those giant satellites from the movies.</p>
<p>I was essentially broadcasting myself to all the existing universes and dimensions. In order to prevent the destruction of all the universes.</p>
<p>Why did I make this choice?</p>
<p>It was my chance to prove wrong Metatron's accusations of me being nothing but trash.</p>
<p>I chose to become the force which would move these universes forward.</p>
<p>Of course, all this was only made possible due to the Sephiroth network which Machina had created. It acted like a TV network, as it diffused my intent across space. I was willing to remake the universe and fight against my very own destiny.</p>
<p>Purrrrrrrr</p>
<p>A large number of rings lit up around me.</p>
<p>"What's going on Lena?"</p>
<p>"You can't leave me behind since we are already one."</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"I'm still curious about the self-sacrifice you are committing, so I will continue to tag along.</p>
<p>"You...."</p>
<p>"It's fine. Although it may take some time, I'm confident the Johra will return, and you'll also be able to receive Machina's help."</p>
<p>"Okay... with your help I should be able to accomplish my goals more easily."</p>
<p>"Standing by, 3...2...1..."</p>
<p>The enormous array was activated and enshrouded me in bright blue lights.</p>
<p>"Guess I will continue my mission to grow and expand to new horizons."</p>
<p>"Yes! And I'll be counting on you, Lena!"</p>
<p>Shortly after I disappeared along with the blinding light as my very existence was divided and scattered across the universes, I fell into darkness.</p>
<p>I couldn't see nor use any of my five senses. Simply drifting across space like an insignificant speck of dust.</p>
<p>Chomp!"</p>
<p>'What?'</p>
<p>When I finally gained consciousness, it felt like being born for the first time.</p>
<p>'Has everything to this point been a dream?'</p>
<p>"It seems that this is the origin point of time."</p>
<p>"Lena?"</p>
<p>Chomp!</p>
<p>I tried to talk with her but only the clamping of my jaws was heard.</p>
<p>"Oh... Johra you're back. It seems that you can't talk yet, but it's fine since I working on a communication system with Machina. Just relax since you might be a bit confused and disoriented right now."</p>
<p>Chomp!</p>
<p>I once again tried to speak but no words came out.</p>
<p>"You may not remember entirely, but you sacrificed yourself in order to prevent the destruction of all the universes. You've been asleep this entire time, until finally returning to the origin of time itself."</p>
<p>'Was the origin of time really when I became a skeleton soldier? The very beginning of everything?'</p>
<p>I was doubtful but had no way to voice my opinion.</p>
<p>Chiiiiic</p>
<p>Feeling some burning sensation in the back of my neck, I once again heard Lena's voice.</p>
<p>"Try to focus on projecting your thoughts through the vibrations in your bones."</p>
<p>"Uh... does it work?"</p>
<p>I felt my own voice ringing throughout my body.</p>
<p>"We are communicating through the conduction of your body, it seems to be working fine. For now Johra you need to follow the flow of history, so please get up and follow them."</p>
<p>"Oh... right."</p>
<p>I got up and trudged along, following the dozens of other skeleton soldiers just like myself.</p>
<p>"Lena, I know what happens to me next, do I still need to go?"</p>
<p>"Yes, it would be best to follow the events as closely as possible, until a certain breakpoint occurs."</p>
<p>"A breakpoint in the flow of history?"</p>
<p>"Ah, along with this new body you've lost a lot of your memories, fortunately I've saved everything in the Sephiros network. I've also noted all the instances where your decisions may have affected the stability of the future. For now just listen as you walk."</p>
<p>"Oh... I see."</p>
<p>I heard the grinding of bones all around me.</p>
<p>"I've come to the conclusion that these divergences or breakpoints are opportune moments to prevent the end of the universe. If history were to change, then perhaps that ideal chance wouldn't exist anymore."</p>
<p>"So when does this special breakpoint arrive?"</p>
<p>Suddenly I heard people crying in the distance.</p>
<p>"Gillian, I told you we should have brought a priest over!"</p>
<p>"Don't you know how hard it is to find a priest these days?"</p>
<p>"Oh never mind, the skeletons are already here, please hold them off a while, I hope this magic will be effective against them."</p>
<p>"Block your ears!"</p>
<p>"Fire Elemental heed my call! Rafflema strike!"</p>
<p>I saw a large fireball crash into the line of skeletons before me, resulting in a shockwave which sent me flying back.</p>
<p>"I guess I have no choice but to fall with the rest of them."</p>
<p>"Actually you are already falling... UUUgg</p>
<p>I lost consciousness in that deep dark pit.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 146</p>
<p>"Do I really need to follow every action to the letter?"</p>
<p>"No, you don't need to perfectly replicate all of your previous actions. As long as you don't miss any significant events then it should be fine."</p>
<p>"Truly?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but I'm still not sure whether Metatron can interfere with the future. I suppose that we can only find out in the upcoming events and see if they match up with what your memories were."</p>
<p>"Hmm..."</p>
<p>Rattle!</p>
<p>I rummaged through the skeleton bones and picked myself a decent dagger and shield.</p>
<p>I then opened my Status.</p>

<p>[Hidden Status] ] [Material Creation Lv8]</p>
<p>★</p>
<p>"I've got quite the ordinary stats."</p>
<p>It was similar to what I remember having when I first woke up as a skeleton so long ago, except that I kept some rainbow coloured unique skills.</p>
<p>"So what was the next step, in order to catch the Tomb Rats I collected some moss, right?"</p>
<p>I went around gathering a bunch of them moss and placed it in a dead end cave.</p>
<p>"Good, that seems to be enough of them, Lena seal the exit with a Rohim's shield."</p>
<p>"Understood."</p>
<p>I waited for the Tomb Rats to come and eat the moss while I pretended to pose as a dead skeleton.</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>After I had caught fourteen of them, the Tyrant of the Tomb made an appearance.</p>
<p>"Oh, how nostalgic, It's been a while mister Tyrant. Just wait a moment, Lena?"</p>
<p>"On it!"</p>
<p>She lowered the shield for a brief moment allowing the Tyrant to enter, before putting it back up and trapping him inside.</p>
<p>"Good, now that they are all together why not deal with them all at once."</p>
<p>I gave them all shallow cuts, until their HP had all but bottomed out.</p>
<p>Yaahhh!</p>
<p>I made quick work of the Tyrant and the fourteen Tomb Rats and the same time, giving me a ton of experience.</p>
<p>'What was my next evolution, Skeleton Wizard?'</p>
<p>I opened up my Status and selected the Wizard as my next evolution. I then went on to try and recall what my next steps were.</p>
<p>I headed towards the Tyrant's hideout and took the magically imbued dagger from the pile of treasure, before crawling through the hole and into the next stage.</p>
<p>"Wow, it's been a while. I wonder if Soleste will still be in that place. Well, I guess even if he is I shouldn't visit at my current level. I went throughout the Catacombs and arrived before the room which had been filled with treasure.</p>
<p>"Wasn't it here that I met Gwyn?"</p>
<p>"Johra, I sense that the breakpoint is near."</p>
<p>After listening to Lena I opened up the door and stepped into the room.</p>
<p>Kiiiiiiiic</p>
<p>Despite searching through the loot extensively, I couldn't find and signs of the glass in which Gwyn was supposed to be sealed in.</p>
<p>"Well this is definitely a change from the future I had known. Well I guess it isn't a big deal if Gwyn isn't around... oh wait, wasn't it her who saved Ian. If without Gwyn, I might have let them die all. It was Gwyn's compassion which drove me to save them."</p>
<p>I walked out of the room equipped with my magical dagger, shield and a cape.</p>
<p>"I hope Gwyn is free and flying around happily right now."</p>
<p>I made a small prayer for Gwyn's sake as I sat down in the room guarded by Gargoyles, waiting for Ian's party to arrive.</p>
<p>"Should I save all the party members this time around? No, perhaps then Ian and I wouldn't have the same relationship...."</p>
<p>I was struggling with the morality of it all when I heard a voice.</p>
<p>"Gillian is it true that there are heaps of treasure here?"</p>
<p>"Yes, when I came about four months ago I wasn't able to explore too deeply because of the number of skeletons but I'm sure there's a bunch of treasure."</p>
<p>"My subclass is Historian and I can guarantee that what Gillian said was true."</p>
<p>"Sigh... Pirate, I already regret coming to these old and smelly Catacombs, You better be right about all that treasure because if you've tricked me, I'll tell your wife that you cheated on her with Lyllian last year."</p>
<p>"Oh no, please don't Azelin will kill me!"</p>
<p>"So quickly show me where that treasure is, do you have any idea how much it costs to hire a priest these days? It's not an amount that some small fries like you can afford to pay."</p>
<p>After hearing their nostalgic conversation, I felt a bit bad knowing what fate was in store for them.</p>
<p>Shortly after the Gargoyles shook themselves awake and the battle began.</p>
<p>"Johra would you like to teleport them?"</p>
<p>"Is it possible?"</p>
<p>"Yes, we can move them to a camp created by Machina."</p>
<p>"Okay, but do it right before they are about to die.</p>
<p>"Sure, but please make a dummy corpse to replace them with.</p>
<p>"Good idea, Material Creation!"</p>
<p>Luckily I still had some of my more advanced abilities so at the last second we teleported them out with a magic circle created by Lena, and I replaced them with a fake corpse to fool their party members.</p>
<p>At some point it was only Ian and Melinda left, along with the bloodied dummy corpses of their companions.</p>
<p>"Guess it's my turn now right?"</p>
<p>I got up and ran towards the Gargoyles.</p>
<p>Shoong</p>
<p>Kuuukuu Kuukuu</p>
<p>I stabbed the two Gargoyles in their vital points and they immediately crumbled into pieces of rock.</p>
<p>Tak Tak</p>
<p>I shook the dust of fmy cape while Ian and Melinda stared at me wide eyed. They had been facing death just moments ago, but were suddenly saved out of nowhere. The two women fell down unconscious to the ground, shocked by the sudden turn of events.</p>
<p>"Hmm... Melinda, we kind of had a bad history."</p>
<p>It might have all originated from a misunderstanding, but I still wasn't easy to forgive her betrayal.</p>
<p>"It's fine Lena, we can let Melinda off."</p>
<p>"Oh?"</p>
<p>In the past she had already paid for that betrayal with her life, so we can consider the debt settled.</p>
<p>"I see."</p>
<p>Melinda was then sent off to the camp set up by Machina, while I tended to the unconscious Ian.</p>
<p>"Material Creation!"</p>
<p>After stocking her with more than sufficient food and water, I left the Catacombs and headed for the cave.</p>
<p>"Is it now time to face the dragon?"</p>
<p>After waiting for a short while I finally heard it stomping its way toward me.</p>
<p>"Can I not kill it again, Lena? Is the Machina's place seperate?"</p>
<p>"They get sent kind of unconscious status."</p>
<p>"Okay, then let's take that guy as well."</p>
<p>"Isn't it a bit big?"</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>As soon at it caught sight of me it sped toward me greedily, intent of having me for a snack.</p>
<p>"I guess it's normal behaviour for a dragon."</p>
<p>I easily trapped it with the Rohim Shield and sent to my seperate space, before then proceeding toward his nest.</p>
<p>"Ah, it looks like there is once again only a single egg left."</p>
<p>Taking it with me I walked through the long tunnel, taking me half a day before I finally arrived back at the Pit, finding it to be exactly as I remembered it in my memories.</p>
<p>"Ah~ my long lost Pit!"</p>
<p>The termites crawled their way towards me and after a short four hour long battle I once again regained my title as Wizard of the Pit.</p>
<p>'I can't believe it. I, losing to such a weak undead!'</p>
<p>"Sorry mister King, but I can't keep you alive if I want to regain possession of this place."</p>
<p>Killing him off I once again received the status of King of the Pit.</p>
<p>"Alpeon!"</p>
<p>'Did you call for me great Lord?'</p>
<p>Alpeon replied with her telepathic message which I had not heard in quite some time.</p>
<p>"Have you been well?"</p>
<p>"Uh... Yes?'</p>
<p>"Ha ha ha!"</p>
<p>I used my Resurrection Song to bring back the King termite and housed him with Machina.</p>
<p>I then once again proceeded to get Bianca and her Arachne's to bend the knee, before moving on to Nymue's lake.</p>
<p>"Lord!"</p>
<p>"Hello Nymue."</p>
<p>"Do you know me?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"You have such good intel, here take this sword."</p>
<p>"Great, thanks."</p>
<p>I once again held Excalibur in my hand. It was the sword I had last created as a God and perhaps one of the strongest Artifacts in existence.</p>
<p>"Hu hu... I finally got you back.</p>
<p>I released the limiters I had previously set on it, using nothing but my bony skeleton fingers.</p>
<p>Booooong</p>
<p>Excalibur's full potential was unleashed.</p>
<p>[Indestructible LvMax] [Spacetime Control LvMax] [Return LvMax] [Extreme Destruction LvMax]</p>
<p>In retrospect it was insane of Abaddon to put such skills in the sword.</p>
<p>When we had been working together to build Skyfather, he had helped enchant Excalibur. It had originally been an incredible sword, but after combining Abaddon powers it had grown beyond imagining.</p>
<p>"Wait, how were you able to unleash the swords full potential? It was said that not even the Gods were able to do so!"</p>
<p>Nymue asked, unable to believe what had occured before her.</p>
<p>"Well... it's because I'm the one who made it."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 147</p>
<p>"So, can you go ahead and lead the way to the King's secret room?"</p>
<p>'Ah, yes right away!'</p>
<p>We made our way through the tunnels of the termite hill, all the while conversing with Alpeon through telepathy until we arrived at the room which hid the World Tree's roots.</p>
<p>"Lena, open up a line with Machina."</p>
<p>"Ok, but in order to do so you need to first physically touch them."</p>
<p>Following her instruction I bent down and grabbed the thick roots.</p>
<p>"It's been a while!"</p>
<p>"It has indeed."</p>
<p>"Your appearance seems to have changed again."</p>
<p>"What do you mean by again?"</p>
<p>"It isn't the first time that we meet, and you've often had different bodies, but something feels different. Could this be your original body?"</p>
<p>"That isn't important, I have something I need you to do.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Can you figure out what is different in this timeline compared to when I first lived it?"</p>
<p>"Perhaps, some minor changes, but since I only have second hand knowledge of what you experienced, it is hard to know perfectly."</p>
<p>"That should be fine, for now please find out the whereabouts of a Pixie named Gwyn."</p>
<p>"Ok, I'll inform you as soon as I find something."</p>
<p>"Great. Oh, and how many Void Scuttles are currently under here? "</p>
<p>"About 2 billion."</p>
<p>"That should be plenty, and just where does it lead to?"</p>
<p>"It passes through three different universes. The first is the one which the Elves named Elfheim. The second is one called Evelysla, and the last is where my roots originate from."</p>
<p>"I see, then is it possible for me to follow these roots down?"</p>
<p>"Yes, but it would be best to be wary of the universe named Evelysla because it is under the control of the Trons."</p>
<p>"Oh, it would be nice to meet them after all this time. Did you create Elfheim in order to resist the Trons, Machina?"</p>
<p>"That's right."</p>
<p>"Then why is it that you later expelled the Elves from their birthplace?"</p>
<p>"I had no choice but to do so in order to save their lives. The Trons had created far too many Void Scuttles which infested Elfheim. Although I have managed to get their numbers under control, I haven't been able to eliminate them entirely."</p>
<p>"Then would the Elves be able to return to Elfheim now?"</p>
<p>"Well there are still quite a few Scuttles left, and after all this time they have evolved and become quite dangerous so they would be too much of a threat to the Elves right now. We would first have to further trim their numbers."</p>
<p>"Naturally, now can you tell me why it is that the Asmodians were also kicked out of Evelysla?"</p>
<p>The Asmodians that you find here in this world are those which rebelled against the Trons, as they refused to be used as cannon fodder in their endless war.</p>
<p>"Okay, I understand. Let me know when you find any news of Gwyn."</p>
<p>"Yes"</p>
<p>After talking with Machina, I ordered the Termites to dig beneath us.</p>
<p>A few hours later they managed to break through to the floor with Void Scuttles</p>
<p>"Enough!"</p>
<p>I bathed my body in the golden nectar then jumped down through the hole, falling amid a swarm of them.</p>
<p>"Lena!"</p>
<p>"On it!"</p>
<p>A Rohim Shield appeared around me, forming a safe zone that they couldn't enter.</p>
<p>Tchi— Tchiii!</p>
<p>The sound of their claws attempting to tear their way through the shield rang out, but they couldn't get through and I simply ignored it.</p>
<p>"Why don't you all be good boys and die properly?"</p>
<p>I created a positron bomb and limited the power to be more suitable to the situation. I then used Excalibur to manipulate time around here and cried out.</p>
<p>"Lena open up a gap, Eat this!"</p>

<p>"So next was the Golden DemiLich right? Wait, I should learn from my mistake and maybe stop here."</p>
<p>"Last time I had become a Demi Lich, I had lost control of my emotions and harmed those around me. Although I may be able to now cope with the situation better, I didn't want to risk it and remained a Golden ArchLich instead.</p>
<p>Most importantly however was the fact that I had regained me Magic Research. I accelerated time around me to the maximum and proceeded to raise its level to the Max.</p>
<p>"Good... I finally have more options available to me."</p>

<p>As my Creation Magic sped through its levels, I had gained several unique and enticing skills, but what had been waiting for me at the very end was beyond any of my expectations.</p>
<p>"Johra, that skills seems to be the essence of all Creations."</p>
<p>"Indeed, like this am I not just the Creator, the Almighty himself?"</p>
<p>I fell silent as I went into a deep thought.</p>
<p>I had always had questions and shifted the blame to others when it came to who ordered the separation of the Alpha and Omega. But in the end it seemed like I was at the origin of their powers.</p>
<p>There were only two options, either I was the main culprit or it was another who then passed on their power.</p>
<p>"Definitely couldn't have been me...."</p>
<p>I shook my head and ignored the truth. There was only a 50% chance after all.</p>
<p>I then returned to the surface and awaited the arrival of the envoys.</p>
<p>"So now is when the three envoys come, right?"</p>
<p>'Hasn't it always been just two envoys?'</p>
<p>Alpeon's Telepathic response caught me off guard.</p>
<p>"Two? It should be the Elves, Asmodians as well as the League of Reincarnators."</p>
<p>'League of Reincarnators? This is the first I've heard of them, my Lord. '</p>
<p>"That can't... then the League... Ha ha!"</p>
<p>I had chanced upon another major difference in the timelines. I quickly returned underground and placed my hand on the roots, asking Machina to investigate anything about the Reincarnators.</p>
<p>'What about Soleste?'</p>
<p>Quickly heading back through the cave tunnels I pushed in the large Crypt doors behind which Soleste had previously been trapped.</p>
<p>Huuung</p>
<p>I was greeted by nothing but emptiness. No Soleste or summoned skeletons in sight. It was completely different from what my first memory of this place had been.</p>
<p>"Hmm, so this has also changed."</p>
<p>That same night I returned to deal with the Elven and Asmodian delegations, before then sitting down by the lake in which Nymesu resided.</p>
<p>"So if there isn't any League of Reincarnators then Soleste might not even exist. Wait, then would Gnoss still be in that place? Since the original timeline isn't followed there where would he be? What about Valenor or even Earth?"</p>
<p>Questions rang through my mind and I couldn't help but want to see Valenor.</p>
<p>"Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created a simple metallic disk with a jet engine attached to its bottom side.</p>
<p>The disk had a handle bar at the top for me to hold unto so I jumped on top.</p>
<p>"Lena, show me a map!"</p>
<p>"Okay"</p>
<p>HuuWoong!</p>
<p>The disk took off with great speed as I headed towards the Wetheros mountains where I expected to see Valenor.</p>
<p>"Finally here."</p>
<p>Shortly after I arrived at the mountain in which the Dwarves lived, and rushed towards the entrance.</p>
<p>"Who are you and why have you come to the great kingdom under the mountain?"</p>
<p>Dwarven guards wielding spears watched me carefully.</p>
<p>"Take me to see Norman."</p>
<p>"What? Our King? Just who do you think you are you filthy Undead?"</p>
<p>It turns out that it was harder to explain my presence here without having Gnoss with me.</p>
<p>"Oh well, no choice. Lena put up the shield!"</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>I decided to use brute force instead and simply barged in. Sure I was attacked by hundreds of Dwarves as I made my way through the mountain, but I simply ignored them since they couldn't breach my Rohim's Shield.</p>
<p>Creeaak!</p>
<p>I pushed open the doors to the Magma Hall which I recalled in my memories, only to be greeted by and ordinary throne room upon which sat the Dwarven King.</p>
<p>"Shit!"</p>
<p>I turned back around immediately without a second's hesitation and returned to the Pit to grab hold of the World Tree's roots.</p>
<p>"Machina!"</p>
<p>"Yes?"</p>
<p>"Investigate anything and everything about Supreme sages and Gnoss. Also look into Valenor, Soleste and the Reincarnators."</p>
<p>"I have some bad news."</p>
<p>"Oh, what is it?"</p>
<p>"I poured through all the data I have, and there is no mention of a Pixie named Gwyn."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I've rechecked it several times and the name never comes up."</p>
<p>I was rooted in place, as if struck by a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>"She's never existed?"</p>
<p>I was incredibly shocked by the large differences compared to what my timeline had been.</p>
<p>'How am I supposed to react when I find out that someone I loved has never even existed?'</p>
<p>'Is it my fault now that she's never had the chance to even exist? No, I won't believe it, I can't! Absolutely not!'</p>
<p>I shouted to myself in anger as I flew to the cave where I first found Gnoss.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 148</p>
<p>As I approached the cave, my resolve was shaken.</p>
<p>What if the cave was completely empty?</p>
<p>What would I do then?</p>
<p>Sigh! Making up my mind I stepped inside. Just like in my memory, there was the large altar, but this time the gem within which Gnoss resided wasn't there. Instead, there was a big and impressive key.</p>
<p>'This is the key which the Princess handed to me back then. '</p>
<p>I thought to myself as I grabbed ahold of it.</p>
<p>Clearly someone had left this here for me to find and use to open the Tower of God.</p>
<p>"Johra, that's the same key as last time, the one with the strange atomic mass."</p>
<p>"Yes, it looks like we will have to make a trip to tip of Antarctica."</p>
<p>"I'll pull you up a map."</p>
<p>Using the disk, I flew towards where I believed the Tower of God to be.</p>
<p>'Who could have left that key for me. It couldn't have been Metatron or Skyfather since they shouldn't know this part of the future. Just who was it that cause all those who are so precious to me to disappear? I really have no idea!'</p>
<p>I helplessly tried to deduce who my new opponent would be as I flew South.</p>
<p>"It's huge. It's like...</p>
<p>"It's like Machina's Roots. It extends so high up that it connects to new worlds."</p>
<p>I looked up at the tower which was so tall that it pierced the clouds and seemed to stretch into infinity.</p>
<p>KuuKuuuKuung</p>
<p>As I approached the tower three fireballs fell before me.</p>
<p>"Are you trying to stop me?"</p>
<p>Three giant angels appeared in the air.</p>
<p>"14 wings, it must be the highest class of angel, a Cherubim"</p>
<p>" Ah, so you guys are Skyfather's ultimate creation?"</p>
<p>HooWuonng!</p>
<p>Without bothering to answer, the angel closest to me swung its flaming sword, incinerating the very spot I had previously been standing in. However I had simply walked past them as I made my way to the tower.</p>
<p>They couldn't block my way since I wielded Excalibur which could control time and space.</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>I heard the sounds of the Cherubim frantically rushing towards me but I simply ignored then and calmly inserted the key.</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>Tens of millions of magic circles activated and the invisible shield guarding the tower disappeared.</p>
<p>The Tower of Gods had finally opened.</p>
<p>I turned around because I had stopped hearing the sound of the Cherubim approaching, but realised that time itself had stopped.</p>
<p>"The time has stopped? How very dramatic."</p>
<p>Grasping the door handle, I swung it open and stepped inside, discovering and entirely new dimension. I was in what seemed like a new world. Devoid of anything but an empty space and a staircase which seemed to pierce the sky.</p>
<p>"Is this the infamous stairway to heaven?"</p>
<p>"I don't know how this dimension was created, but there don't appear to be any dangers."</p>
<p>"Yup, whoever designed this made it huge."</p>
<p>Tak!</p>
<p>I took my first step on the staircase.</p>
<p>"Are you going up, Johra?"</p>
<p>"Naturally, since I've received an invitation it would be rude not to show up."</p>
<p>I replied as I continued to climb up.</p>
<p>I soon lost track of time as the sun shone 24/7 and there wasn't any nighttime. I walked on for what seemed like ages until at one point I realised that beside me appeared a unique set of clouds.</p>
<p>"How beautiful."</p>
<p>"Johra those clouds aren't normal. There density is so high that one can easily walk on them."</p>
<p>"Oh, let me try."</p>
<p>Puuk!</p>
<p>My foot sank in slightly but otherwise it supported my weight. It felt like walking on cotton.</p>
<p>"So soft!"</p>
<p>I walked around happily, enjoying the feeling of lightness and the soft clouds.</p>
<p>"Have I wandered too far from the stairs"</p>
<p>"Don't worry Johra since I've got the whole palace mapped out, we can return any time. Also, I think that there is something in front over there."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>I walked in the direction Lena pointed out for about half a day until I arrived before a unique castle made out of pure white stone. The roof was plated in gold and it reflected the sunlight splendidly.</p>
<p>"It's quite huge, but why does it seem so familiar?"</p>
<p>I arrived before the castle gates and the drawbridge descended.</p>
<p>"Were they expecting me?"</p>
<p>I walked along the streets inside the castle walls and every single building was made up of the same pure white stone with the doors and roofs decorated in gold.</p>
<p>"Is there anyone even living in here?"</p>
<p>I had walked through the city streets but couldn't find any signs of life.</p>
<p>"Wait, Necropolis! Doesn't it look just like my old city?"</p>
<p>I took my half a day of wandering about to finally make the connection. The architecture and urban management was exactly like it had been in my memories of Necropolis.</p>
<p>Even the inside of the buildings were carefully reproduced, down to the furniture and tools. It appeared that until seconds before my arrival, this had been a vibrant city. The only thing that felt strange was the fact that everything was the color white.</p>
<p>"If the outside is so similar, then the inside of castle should likewise be identical."</p>
<p>I recognized the entrance the the palace which I had previously resided in. beside the entrance stood two empty suits of armor as guards.</p>
<p>Clink clink!</p>
<p>The suits of armor moved and opened the doors for me as I approached.</p>
<p>"It looks like I've been invited in...."</p>
<p>As I walked into what appeared to be my previous throne room, I saw someone sitting proudly on the throne.</p>
<p>"Ah... so it was you."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 149</p>
<p>"It's been a while hasn't it?"</p>
<p>"How is it possible for you to be here before me?"</p>
<p>"Because it is my destiny to meet you, despite the fact that you've already killed me once."</p>
<p>"So you remember that, Lorina."</p>
<p>Right, the one who was sitting before me was in fact the same Lorina from the League of Reincarnators. She was garbed in a shiny gold dress and looked down at me arrogantly with an aura of royalty.</p>
<p>"Of course, have you forgotten what the purpose of the Tower of God was? To preserve everything in a manner which transcends time and space, here I can remember everything"</p>
<p>"So you're not Lorina?"</p>
<p>"Well... you can think of Lorina as being my Avatar, it was designed as a safety feature to ensure the plane's harmony."</p>
<p>"A safety feature?"</p>
<p>"It is no longer of any concern, so I guess I can activate the final function."</p>
<p>"What's the final function?"</p>
<p>"Oh, don't be so hasty, how about having some tea?"</p>
<p>Culkuk Culkuk</p>
<p>With a swish of her hand a tea set along with a table and chair appeared.</p>
<p>Taking a seat in the chair, I grabbed ahold of my cup. It was a warm tea with a fresh lemony scent.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, you don't want to drink?"</p>
<p>As I was contemplating whether it was safe to drink, Lorina teased me about my cautiousness.</p>
<p>"Hmph! Species Conversion: God!"</p>
<p>I transformed myself back into a God.</p>
<p>It was something that was only possible once my Creation Magic had reached level 9.</p>
<p>To this point I hadn't used it so as not to affect the flow of history, but we were now well past that and I felt no reason to suffer her teasing.</p>
<p>"Hohoho! So you've turned into a God, is this what you looked like as a human? You're surprisingly handsome, want to go out on a date sometime?"</p>
<p>I couldn't help but frown.</p>
<p>Although she was definitely beautiful, her laughter brought back some bad memories of the old Lorina.</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>"Is my charm lacking?"</p>
<p>"Lorina, quickly tell me everything that you know, I don't have much patience. Material Creation!"</p>
<p>With a frown of displeasure I created A Reedemer and bound her in the spheric prison.</p>
<p>Creeak!</p>
<p>Despite the restraints being made of a super reinforced alloy, she broke free of them as if it were the simplest of things.</p>
<p>"You may be strong, but let me remind you that in this space I can't be touched."</p>
<p>"I admit that you're stronger than I expected, but don't think for a second that's all I got."</p>
<p>I spoke confidently as I pulled out Excalibur and slowed down time.</p>
<p>"Oh, didn't I just tell you that in this space my words are absolute?"</p>
<p>My slowing down of time didn't affect her speech in any way, clearly it was ineffective.</p>
<p>"Huh... could it be that you are the Almighty?"</p>
<p>"Ha ha... perhaps."</p>
<p>Lorina let out a pearl laugh as she sipped some more of her tea.</p>
<p>"Give me a straight answer!"</p>
<p>"Geez... as straightforward as ever. Anyways, since you're here I guess I need to keep my end of the deal."</p>
<p>"What deal?"</p>
<p>"Let's see...."</p>
<p>Getting up and moving behind her throne, she opened up a chest and began rummaging through it. I followed behind her to have a better look.</p>
<p>"Is it this one, no not yet? I swear it was somewhere around here...."</p>
<p>Hundreds of items were pouring out of the small chest.</p>
<p>'Johra it seems that the chest is connected to a different space. '</p>
<p>Lena came up with an explanation to the ridiculous situation.</p>
<p>"Oh! Here it is!"</p>
<p>Lorina fished out a small egg, about 3 centimeters in diameter.</p>
<p>"What is that?"</p>
<p>"It's your lover."</p>
<p>"Truly?"</p>
<p>I ran up to her and tried to take it from her, but she vanished and reappeared on her throne.</p>
<p>"Shouldn't you be asking politely?"</p>
<p>"Hand it over."</p>
<p>"Huh, was that supposed to be polite?"</p>
<p>"I would really appreciate if you would give it to me."</p>
<p>"Nu-uh!"</p>
<p>Lorina exclaimed as she wagged her index finger before me.</p>
<p>Chit!</p>
<p>Having no other choice, I prostate myself on the floor and begged.</p>
<p>"I would really love for you to give it to me."</p>
<p>"That's more like it! Here you go, I've kept up my end of the bargain."</p>
<p>As I held the egg in me hands, Lorina vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>I searched several times throughout out the palace, but there were no signs of her, in fact there were no signs of life in the entire city.</p>
<p>"Johra, it's a red dragon inside of the egg.</p>
<p>"Well, as I expected."</p>
<p>I hold the egg carefully as I walk along white and gold palace, until I once again reach the clouds.</p>
<p>"Was it this way?"</p>
<p>"Yes the pattern matches the way we came in by."</p>
<p>As I kept walking I came up to a large blue castle.</p>
<p>"It looks like an Ice castle, this isn't some fairy tale is it?"</p>
<p>The entirety of this palace was the exact same as the one I had just come from when I met Lorina.</p>
<p>I was getting pretty fed up of all this when I noticed two people waiting for me in the throne room.</p>
<p>"So it's you two this time?"</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 150</p>
<p>"Long time no see!"</p>
<p>"Yes, it's been a while."</p>
<p>The ones who were sitting on the throne were the vessels of Sha and L who had fused with Abbadon.</p>
<p>"Gaia, Odin, so it was you two."</p>
<p>"That's right, we've been waiting here for you."</p>
<p>"Can you explain to me what the current situation is?"</p>
<p>They stood up and nodded respectfully.</p>
<p>"Please have a seat."</p>
<p>A large throne chair appeared behind me.</p>
<p>"Sure."</p>
<p>"Actually, I'm not entirely sure where to start."</p>
<p>"Just speak truthfully, start at when we last met until now."</p>
<p>"I'll begin with our promise, back when we were all one with the Omega which was about 25 billion years ago."</p>
<p>Gaia, who was Sha's incarnation, looked to Odin and after receiving a nod, continued with her story.</p>
<p>"You had promised us to put an end the eternal cycle of destruction and rebirth."</p>
<p>"Cycle of rebirth?You mean regarding the universes?"</p>
<p>"Right, we were exhausted by the concept of endless recycling of the universe and the fact that only the Alpha and Omega would keep their memories."</p>
<p>"Yes, you've told me before that you had this promise with the future me."</p>
<p>"Yes, it was and incredible situation which was only allowed to happen because there was an important condition attached."</p>
<p>"What was the condition?"</p>
<p>"You promised to show us a new and unfamiliar future."</p>
<p>"Was that the promise..."</p>
<p>Gaia nodded her head and continued.</p>
<p>"At that point Abbadon, the Omega, was against such an idea and chose to rebel, resulting in a seperation of the powers of Destruction and Creation."</p>
<p>"Hm... yes that's a story I've heard before."</p>
<p>"Then the future Johra said that he will push ahead with his plan for the future."</p>
<p>"A plan? Wait, wasn't the future me supposed to have disappeared?"</p>
<p>Gaia shook her head.</p>
<p>We are now in the final act which the future Johra has prepared.</p>
<p>"How can...the future me? Does he still exist?"</p>
<p>"Find out for yourself, the answer lies and the end of this staircase, it shouldn't be far now."</p>
<p>"The end of the stairs... will he truly be there?"</p>
<p>"You've been through and suffered a lot, but in the end everything was for the future of the universe."</p>
<p>"Dammit, I can't believe this!"</p>
<p>I dashed out of the room and headed for the stairs. I could hear Gaia and Odin calling out to me, but their voices soon began to fade.</p>
<p>"I can't believe this! How can I be the future me? Why would I have done all this?"</p>
<p>I ran up the stairs non stop, tears spilling from my eyes.</p>
<p>I lost track of time, unsure how long I had been running. If I fell, I would just pick myself back up and continue running for what seemed like eternity, until finally a shining sphere appeared.</p>
<p>"Is this the end?"</p>
<p>My surroundings disappeared and all that remained was the small egg I held in my hands. Then Lena's voice came out.</p>
<p>"Johra, this is an entirely separate dimension. It's chaotic here... time seems to be flowing every which way, my calculations can't keep up...."</p>
<p>Then, just as Lena had to shut herself down to keep from thinking herself to death, I heard a familiar, but more mature voice call out to me.</p>
<p>"Come here, Johra."</p>
<p>"You... who are you?"</p>
<p>"You already know the answer to that."</p>
<p>"Right, I guess you're the main culprit behind all this."</p>
<p>"Well, I suppose you have the right to refer to me as that...to say the truth you've far exceeded my expectations by overcoming everything you've faced.."</p>
<p>"Son of bitch!"</p>
<p>I tried to swing a vicious hook towards the voice, but it was pointless.</p>
<p>"Sorry, I'm here and at the same time I'm not. The stronger you become, the closer I am to disappearing entirely. I no longer have much time left."</p>
<p>"What, you're just going to up and disappear, leaving me with this mess? Give me back Gwyn! Gnoss! Lilinor! All those who are most precious to me!"</p>
<p>"Still the same greedy one, do you truly believe you can have it all?"</p>
<p>"Why not? It's not like I'm asking for much!"</p>
<p>"Wrong, we are one and the same person. In order to move up in this Universe we had promised to sacrifice those who are most precious to us."</p>
<p>"No way! I would have never!"</p>
<p>"Really, do you want to see the memory?"</p>
<p>Aaaaah!</p>
<p>I was suddenly flooded with billions of years of memory, all crashing down on me at once.</p>
<p>I experienced the endless reincarnations of the universe, rendering all things meaningless. A brilliant, but empty world as a fear grew within me. I experienced the horrors of the future me as well as the pain of losing those I loved most.</p>
<p>I lived that heartbreaking scene, as well as the decision to return to the past and manipulate the most powerful forces in the universe, all so it could be avoided.</p>
<p>All that had happened, I had been a part of. As I felt myself intervening in the universe, I felt the pain of others engraved in my heart, but also my resolve hardened.</p>
<p>I saw the process by which the Tower of God was created, and how Gaia, Odin and Makina helped out.</p>
<p>Indeed, he had the same access to the Sephiroth network as I, we were the same person.</p>
<p>I had used it throughout time to manipulate events across the universes, which resulted in this very moment.</p>
<p>"... I was the one who was behind it all."</p>
<p>"Right, you and I are the same."</p>
<p>"Yes, we are one."</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 151</p>
<p>"Johra?"</p>
<p>"That's right, I'm Johra. The past, present and future me were all one, suffering under that cursed name."</p>
<p>I had received the billions of years worth of memories and experiences which my future self had accumulated. A power to control and even transcend the universe itself.</p>
<p>I knew what happened from the very beginning to the very end, and everything could bend according to my will.</p>
<p>I had changed the past, sowing the seeds for a future that would last forever, but it was all done blindly, without having a clue how it would turn out. As a result, I ended up sacrificing both myself and those who were the most precious to me.</p>
<p>And now I was back to the present, afraid of my very own powers. With but a thought I could cause the end of the universe or even have it frozen in time indefinitely.</p>
<p>The fate of all beings, be they mortal of divine were at my discretion.</p>
<p>"The ability to do whatever you pleased is a truly disgusting thing."</p>
<p>I suddenly wished to restore those who had been sacrificed in order to arrive at this present reality. But at that time an intense confusion swelled up within me.</p>
<p>'Just what would be the result of restoring them? Would they be there true selves, or just a shadow of my memories of them?'</p>
<p>While I had this doubt, I knew that I couldn't go through with it.</p>
<p>"Was that the reason that my future self chose to disappear and leave the decision in my hands? Damn him!"</p>
<p>I shook my fist towards the sky, angry with my future self, but I also knew that it was pointless.</p>
<p>At least I had this tiny egg in my hands, within it breathed my love in her smallest and most vulnerable form.</p>
<p>"...Yes, I still have a lot to do before the end of the universe comes around."</p>
<p>"Did you call for us, Johra?"</p>
<p>Gaia and Odin appeared in a flash of light.</p>
<p>"SkyFather!"</p>
<p>"...Johra is that you?"</p>
<p>The machine android, Skyfather appeared as well.</p>
<p>Gaia and Odin made a small frown, but soon composed themselves and looked to me.</p>
<p>"I'll give you all strength."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Just what are you trying to do?"</p>
<p>They all responded with different expressions.</p>
<p>"I thought that you were going to use this power to show us a unique and wonderful future, especially since you've been through so much now."</p>
<p>Gaia said as she looked at me affectionately. Odin and Skyfather on the other hand remained skeptical.</p>
<p>"I will, but until that time comes I'll have you three sit in for me, because right now I just want to enjoy the world!"</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Truly?"</p>
<p>"Why?"</p>
<p>"Hey, I've been running around the universes, trying to put out fire and keep things going, so I think I'm due a little break, that's why I'm quitting right now."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about? You can't just quit!"</p>
<p>"Johra?"</p>
<p>"Enough! If I say I'm quitting then I am!"</p>
<p>I quickly proceed to hand over my powers and split it between the three of them.</p>
<p>"Foolish! Haven't you considered what I might do with these newfound powers?"</p>
<p>Skyfather exclaims threateningly.</p>
<p>"You can do what you want. I've given you strength and a purpose, so as long as you don't ruin my little vacation then it's fine. Gaia, Odin, what about you two?"</p>
<p>They both nodded back reluctantly with a somewhat disgruntled expression.</p>
<p>"If you two team up against me, then I can't do anything."</p>
<p>Skyfather also understood the situation since my powers had been evenly distributed between the three of them.</p>
<p>"Well I'll be going now to enjoy my time off, I'll trust you all to take care of the rest."</p>
<p>I then reappeared inside the Pit.</p>
<p>"Alpeon! Make me a nest! I need a grand bed for my love to be comfortable."</p>
<p>'Alright!'</p>
<p>Upon the nest which Alpeon built for me, I created a comfy bed for it to rest on using my Material Creation.</p>
<p>Fufufu~</p>
<p>I stared at my egg lovingly with a happy expression.</p>
<p>'Lord, that's a disgusting face you have there. '</p>
<p>Bianca who had just finished with the construction, decided to tease me.</p>
<p>"What did you say!"</p>
<p>She was my last love in this life, I would care for her with everything I had.</p>
<p>Eventually Bianca got fed up of seeing my strange expression and left. I then felt a certain presence in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>"Gaia."</p>
<p>"Oh, how did you notice me?"</p>
<p>"Why are you here? I thought I asked you not to bother me."</p>
<p>"I came to tell you some good news."</p>
<p>"What is it?"</p>
<p>"Do you still remember that the purpose of the Tower was to store beings to later be given life once more?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and at that time I'd have to reintroduce the beings which had been recycled."</p>
<p>"Right, but it seems that one of them have gone missing.</p>
<p>"What? Was it Gwyn, or one of the others?"</p>
<p>"Well... Odin and I were looking through the archives and going through all the eggs, but one of the had disappeared. They won't be as you last knew them since the memories won't all be there, but it will be the same being."</p>
<p>"Is that so... then can I meet them?"</p>
<p>"It's already been restored and you'll be meeting her soon as it is part of the planned events in the universe."</p>
<p>"Is it all according to the planned future?"</p>
<p>Gaia nodded back.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 152</p>
<p>"Alpeon, don't let anyone leave the confines of the Pit."</p>
<p>'Yes Lord. '</p>
<p>I materialized my metal disk and flew over the cliff.</p>
<p>"Last time I went into battle with Valenor, but now I'm all alone."</p>
<p>A cloud of dust gathered in the distance and huge dragons appeared in the horizon above it.</p>
<p>"Tch! Just why did she have to ask me to go easy on Noradriana and here silly dragons?"</p>
<p>I hovered on my metal disk, awaiting the arrival of the Elves and Dragons in the middle of the plains.</p>
<p>Half a day later the host of 10,000 Elves and the dragons stopped their advance before me.</p>
<p>"Lena, could you amplify my voice please?"</p>
<p>"Okay, I can set so that the animals near us can hear you well."</p>
<p>"Animal? Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha you can truly make some funny jokes!!!"</p>
<p>A booming laughter was rang across the plains at an incredibly high volume, causing the Elves to drop to the ground and hold their ears in pain.</p>
<p>"Sorry, didn't mean to disturb you all."</p>
<p>Lena adjusted the volume to a more reasonable level and I was heard without any problems. Perhaps the previous outburst was one of Lena's little jokes, but at least it managed to get everyone's attention.</p>
<p>"I'm glad you've all come today, but I can't say I appreciate the hostility shown. In light of that, I'd like to show you all a little something... Up!"</p>
<p>At once the ten thousand Elves and Dragons began to float into the air.</p>
<p>Although I had handed over most of my powers to Gaia, Odin and Skyfather, my connection to the Sephiroth network still existed.</p>
<p>For the Elves, the one hundred meters height was already quite a danger to them if they were to fall, as for the dragons, despite trying to resist with their magic, it was all for naught because it was blocked by the Sephiroth network.</p>
<p>"Well hopefully that has made you all a bit more humble, now all you should go back home, except for Noradriana that is. Okay, the Elven elders may come over as well. I have a certain debt to repay, so I won't be killing you, alright?"</p>
<p>The army before me was forced into subservience due to my overwhelming power, since they had no way of resisting ym magic and couldn't wield their own.</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll put you down slowly now."</p>
<p>I used the Sephiroth network to set them down gently.</p>
<p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p>
<p>Noradriana then approached me along with the Elven elders. Although her body language was once of submission, a glint in her eyes told me otherwise.</p>
<p>"Hopefully I can bring her down a notch without hurting her too much."</p>
<p>As expected, once she was close enough she chose to test whether I could defend against her physical prowess and she opened her jaws and tried to bite me.</p>
<p>Quazic</p>
<p>I summoned my Rohim's Shield up in time and her teeth broke as a result of it.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry about that... I was trying to be gentle but I can't be blamed for self defense, right?"</p>
<p>'Give her some new teeth, Johra. I know your creation magic can do that much, right?'</p>
<p>Gaia's voice appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>'Tch! So she's been watching this whole time. '</p>
<p>Noradriana backed away from me and stared at me in fear.</p>
<p>"Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I recreated her broken teeth. It was made to be sturdier than her previous ones and shone with a golden hue.</p>
<p>"Hey Noradriana, stop that we aren't enemies. Just listen to me, ok?"</p>
<p>Although I had never particularly liked her, she had saved my life way back then, So I had to compensate her in some form.</p>
<p>The Elder green dragon bowed down to me in complete defeat, and the Elven elders beside her likewise prostrated themselves before me.</p>
<p>"You Elves have been defeated and as such need to follow my commands. I want you to move your people to these plains within the next six months! Noradriana, I order you to help the Elven race and as compensation to cover the cost of your march, I give you this! Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created several tons of gold.</p>
<p>"Do not continue even think of backing out of this, anyone who betrays me will be dealt with swiftly."</p>
<p>Turning my back to them I flew back to the Pit.</p>
<p>"Alpeon, how has the digging been going?"</p>
<p>'It hasn't been easy due to the presence of the Void Scuttles, but we are currently up to 900 meters deep.</p>
<p>"I see, keep up the good work."</p>
<p>'Lord, the Asmodians are arriving soon. '</p>
<p>"I'm aware, accommodate them in the dwellings we've constructed on the outskirts.</p>
<p>'Yes lord. '</p>
<p>The Asmodians had come to join me, it meant that it was soon time to kill the Devil King, but I didn't want to have to do everything myself. '</p>
<p>'Well, maybe now that he won't have the help of the Reincarnators he'll stay hidden instead. '</p>
<p>"Oh right! Alpeon have them bring Talvin's body to the lake."</p>
<p>Shortly after I was able to use his body to resurrect Talvin, as a reward for his performance in his past life.</p>
<p>Six months later the Elves and Asmodians were sent back to their homelands in Elfenheim and Evelisla and my troubles had all been resolved in a peaceful manner.</p>
<p>"Oh, I almost forgot that there was a task to help out Gartmar. Alpeon, fetch me Ian."</p>
<p>A short while later Ian appeared before me. Maybe it was because of the peaceful lifestyle, but she appeared somewhat fatter than she did in my memories.</p>
<p>"Did you call for me, my lord?"</p>
<p>"Just call me Johra."</p>
<p>Ian felt quite nervous seeing me wear some unusual clothes.</p>
<p>"Let's see, Lena, can you please contact Makina and have transfer over her former colleagues here?"</p>
<p>"On it!"</p>
<p>Shortly after Ian's old party members appeared next to her.</p>
<p>"Gillian? Pirate? Melinda?"</p>
<p>"Oh where is this place?"</p>
<p>"I thought I was dead for sure."</p>
<p>They all embraced themselves, ecstatic about their reunion.</p>
<p>"I know you're all happy but I'd like for you all to pay attention please."</p>
<p>"Where you the one who saved us?"</p>
<p>"That's right Melinda, this is my Lord."</p>
<p>Following Ian's explanation they all looked up and stared at me intently.</p>
<p>"Well I didn't exactly save you all for free. I have a favor to ask of you."</p>
<p>For the next several months I had the training and levelling up against the Void Scuttles down in the tunnels beneath the Pit, until they had become much stronger.</p>
<p>"Good, now please heat to Gartmar and help out a certain party of women called Kishande, Ashe and Miranda."</p>
<p>I gave them some pocket money and set them on this task as a manner of settling old debts.</p>
<p>"That should solve most things, right?"</p>
<p>The majority of the Elves had returned to their homeland, only a few staying behind to act as intermediaries as well as set up a trading post between us.</p>
<p>I would also occasionally need to send in some elite troops to cull the number of Scuttles near Elfenheim or to defend from the Trons in Evelisla.</p>
<p>Until finally one day.</p>
<p>Pazzic</p>

<p>Chapter 153</p>
<p>Nyaaaaaaa~</p>
<p>A cute red dragon cried out as it broke out of its shell, struggling to get a breath of fresh air while its eyelids were too heavy to open.</p>
<p>"Oh, what am I supposed to do now? It's waay too cute!!!"</p>
<p>'Lord, please control yourself. '</p>
<p>Ignoring Bianca's interjection, I place Valenor in the palm of my hand.</p>
<p>Nya~ Nya~</p>
<p>She exclaims as she attempts to gnaw at my finger with her tiny teeth.</p>
<p>"Are you hungry, here have some of this."</p>
<p>I bring a bottle of warm milk to her mouth and she proceeds to suck on it.</p>
<p>Gloo! Gloo! Gloo!</p>
<p>She quickly downed its contents after which she lied down comfortably on my palm and fell asleep. Absorbed in the moment, I stayed there just watching her peaceful rest.</p>
<p>Nyaaa~</p>
<p>About two hours later she woke up and began to cry.</p>
<p>"Alpeon!"</p>
<p>'Here it is, my Lord. '</p>
<p>Alpeon quickly arrived with some fresh warm milk.</p>
<p>I had once again been reunited with my wife, which was now crawling on my palm. In this manner, 3 years flew by.</p>
<p>I had helped her learn Polymorph and despite now having the appearance of a four year old girl, her strength was far beyond her age.</p>
<p>"Valenor... those clothes...."</p>
<p>"Aren't Johra's clothes also my toys?"</p>
<p>Due to her excessive level ups, her playfulness was on another level of danger, such that a regular human would have died several times already.</p>
<p>Fortunately Valenor was aware that I wasn't so easily killed. She had bad habits of climbing all over my body and attacking or trying to wrestle me, in truth I had no idea where she had picked it all up, but I couldn't help but laugh at her actions.</p>
<p>It truly was a peaceful day.</p>
<p>"Johra, an unknown dragon is flying toward the Pit."</p>
<p>I looked up and saw a giant blue dragon making its way here.</p>
<p>"Ah, you're finally here?"</p>
<p>As it got closer it changed its appearance into that of a female human and ran towards me with her arms open.</p>
<p>"Johra! Johra! Johra!"</p>
<p>"Huh? How do you have your memories of me, Lilinor?"</p>
<p>She sped forward to leap into my arms, but was intercepted midway.</p>
<p>Puk!</p>
<p>"Move! He is mine!"</p>
<p>"Who are you?"</p>
<p>"Ah... I'll introduce you, this is Valenor."</p>
<p>"I'm Johra's wife!"</p>
<p>One day I had let slip that we were married and she had now taken it to heart.</p>
<p>"Johra... did you really have that kind of hobby?"</p>
<p>I shook my head awkwardly, even if I were to try and explain the whole situation, it was hardly a believable story.</p>
<p>We retired to the Necropolis palace and we had a banquet to celebrate Lilinor's arrival.</p>
<p>Lilinor indulged herself in the many dishes, displaying a voracious appetite.</p>
<p>"By the way, how was it that you retained your memories of me, Lilinor?"</p>
<p>"Naturally it was because of the contract between us, which transcends Time and Space"</p>
<p>"Really, how?"</p>
<p>"My real identity is the incarnation of space and time, so I can retain my memories due to this power. Also, there are those children which had taken you as their master, it seems that they don't have any memories of you now."</p>
<p>"Well, it's a bit complicated to meet them now, I'm sure that we'll meet again someday so I will just be patient and wait."</p>
<p>"Phew. Oh right, you also need to hurry. Your slave is in danger."</p>
<p>"What slave?"</p>
<p>Valenor suddenly tried to snatch some food from her plate, but I made her return it to Lilinor.</p>
<p>"Are you talking about Viezda?"</p>
<p>"I found a woman who matched her description, but she was nameless. She was in a pretty terrible condition so I tried to help her, but was blocked by a powerful entity, so I've come to you."</p>
<p>"What? Why have you only now told me?"</p>
<p>"Ah, sorry I just got caught up in our reunion."</p>
<p>"Okay, you can all wait here, I'll go bring her back."</p>
<p>"I'm going too!"</p>
<p>Valenor cried out as she clung to my body.</p>
<p>'Tch! There's no convincing this one!'</p>
<p>I had tried several times to detach her but was unsuccessful so I just resigned myself to bringing her with me and stepped on my metallic disk.</p>
<p>"Wait up Johra! You don't know her location."</p>
<p>Lilinor ran out with some food in each hand.</p>
<p>"Then quickly hop up and guide me there!"</p>
<p>"Wow! This cake is really delicious!"</p>
<p>"When did you become such a glutton?"</p>
<p>"I'm not! It's just that these dishes are way too tasty!"</p>
<p>Within moments we had arrived at Gartmar.</p>
<p>"Over there!"</p>
<p>Peering through the window of some dirty and desolate alley, one inhabited by numerous drug addicts.</p>
<p>"My love should not be suffering in this filth! Material Creation!"</p>
<p>I created a bunch of gold and threw the coins at the thugs, grabbing ahold of Viezda who was coughing and wheezing in the corner of the room.</p>
<p>"Viezda!"</p>
<p>I went to hug her tightly, but realised that her body was incredibly light, like picking up a small branch.</p>
<p>I then used the Sephiroth network to give her emergency treatment and detoxify everyone in the alley.</p>
<p>"Who are you? That isn't my name."</p>
<p>She opened her eyes and looked at me. Naturally she was not yet aware that her name was Viezda.</p>
<p>"From this moment on you are Viezda, my love."</p>
<p>I held her gently and brought her back to Necropolis.</p>
<p>I was quite worried about her sickly appearance and helped nurse her back to health over the course of an entire month. Of course I could have just sped up the process with my magic, but it was bound to leave some after-effects and this natural way was best.</p>
<p>"My lord, why are you so kind to me? I'm nothing but some abandoned prostitute."</p>
<p>I shook my head in response.</p>
<p>You are my wife, Viezda. Don't worry about the rest.</p>
<p>I had improved her health and now had to tackled the next problem. She was still suffering under that curse of hers, so perhaps she would gain some confidence in herself if her beauty was restored.</p>
<p>We were able to achieve this by hunting the Void Scuttles down beneath us, with the help of Lilinor. After a short period of time, she was able to level up enough to erase the curse, but her mental condition didn't improve much. Instead, she seemed even more anxious about her condition.</p>
<p>"Ugh just what am I supposed to do?"</p>
<p>I was able to cure her injuries, but it didn't help me in winning her heart.</p>
<p>I woke up that night to the sound of Viezda's crying sounds coming from the terrace, as she basked in the moonlight.</p>
<p>"Johra, could I help you out here?"</p>
<p>"Gaia? Just how is it that you can help me?"</p>
<p>"Have you forgotten that I'm an incarnation of Sha? It's within my powers to affect one's memories."</p>
<p>"Would you be able to restore Viezda's memories?"</p>
<p>"It might not be perfect, but I should be able to restore the memories of her time with you."</p>
<p>"Please, I beg you to help me with this!"</p>
<p>"Huhu... okay, I will help you, but I also have a favor to ask."</p>
<p>"A favor?"</p>
<p>"It not a big deal at all, it might end up being a bit annoying, but it won't bring you any harm."</p>
<p>"Well... that's a suspicious way to word it, but if it will solve Viezda's current dilemma, I'll do it!"</p>
<p>"Sure, but wasn't there another one as well? Melpo...."</p>
<p>"Melpomene! Yes, where is she now?"</p>
<p>"Huhu! I'll consider it a part of the same favor, so I'll let you know soon enough."</p>
<p>"Great, so please help Viezda."</p>
<p>"When she wakes up tomorrow morning, she'll have her memories back. It may not be perfect, but I'm sure she'll feel much better."</p>
<p>And just as she prophessed, the next morning I was able to meet my Viezda.</p>
<p>"Johra!"</p>
<p>"Viezda!"</p>
<p>"Ho...how could I have forgotten all that?"</p>
<p>"There were a lot of complications involving celestial powers, but that's all done now."</p>
<p>It was more of a half truth, so I wasn't outright lying to her.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry Johra, about...."</p>
<p>"No, none of this was your fault."</p>
<p>As we were hugging intimately, Valenor showed up and attempted to break us up.</p>
<p>"Get away! I'm Johra's wife!"</p>
<p>"Oh yes, I've heard a lot about you, Miss Valenor."</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll forgive you this once since you seem polite, but I'm still the wife!"</p>
<p>Viezda couldn't help but erupt into laughter upon hearing Valenor's dignified declaration.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 154</p>
<p>At first, things were a bit awkward between Viezda, Valenor and Lilinor since they didn't know each other well, but their passion for the game of chess brought them together and they gradually became closer.</p>
<p>I was enjoy my time, staring up at the bright blue sky and watching my three princesses pick up the chessboard after their match, when suddenly Gaia's voice appeared from out of nowhere.</p>
<p>"Are you some kind of womanizer Johra? Look at how happy all these women are with you."</p>
<p>"Stop that, Gaia. What are you here for?"</p>
<p>Although I could already guess the reason she had come, I figured I'd play along a bit.</p>
<p>"Huhu! Do you remember that favor which involved Melpomene?"</p>
<p>"Of course, and since you have control of most of the universes, it won't be an easy task, right?</p>
<p>"Come on, you can easily deal with this. Also, this doesn't only concern Melpomene, but all the humans on Earth."</p>
<p>"What? Earth? Is Metatron somehow involved in all this?"</p>
<p>"It seems Melpomene was born on Earth and in the same time period as your human life there. But, as you well know, Earth is currently under the influence of Metatron."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"Metatron and I are like the two sides to one coin, we can't one up each other, not to mention that Earth is like his home ground."</p>
<p>"So you want me to take care of him?"</p>
<p>"Something like that. I know that you two have some sort of arrangement by which he has to follow the course of history, but you know what terrible future is in store for Earth, so...."</p>
<p>"Will I have any problems with this favor then?"</p>
<p>"You know full well how strong you still are."</p>
<p>"I see, so what do I need to accomplish by going back over there?"</p>
<p>"Two things actually, the first is to return with Melpomene and the second is to save Gnoss."</p>
<p>"Gnoss?"</p>
<p>"Yes, Gnoss will actually play a relatively important role since he is destined to stand up to Metatron."</p>
<p>"Ugh! How annoying."</p>
<p>"I'll throw in a bonus, so please do this for me."</p>
<p>"Fine, then when would this occur?"</p>
<p>"Right now."</p>
<p>"Hey! No, wait up Gaia! I haven't finished yet...."</p>
<p>Before I could say anything else, she placed her hand on me forehead and I was whisked back into the past.</p>
<p>"That dam Gaia...."</p>
<p>As I opened my eyes felt myself crumpled down in some smelly area, with light filtering in from above.</p>
<p>"Over here...!"</p>
<p>I shouted, hoping others could hear my voice.</p>
<p>Shortly after I heard a couple voices.</p>
<p>"Hey, are you okay down there?"</p>
<p>"A child has just fallen in there!"</p>
<p>'Oh, did I just return to the exact moment when I had fallen down the manhole?'</p>
<p>I tried some magic skills but nothing appeared, likewise calling out the status page didn't work.</p>
<p>"I'm down here! Please get some help!"</p>
<p>I shouted out anxiously and after some time a knotted rope descended which I used to climb out of the manhole.</p>
<p>The next couple of days there was talk of the boy which was miraculously saved despite having fallen in a manhole, but as time passed the incident was quickly forgotten and I had returned to me regular life.</p>
<p>'My magic skills still aren't working, could it have all been a dream?'</p>
<p>I began doubting many of my memories.</p>
<p>After having returned to Earth, my relationship with my parents had improved drastically. Due to my many life experiences, I was able to properly express my affection for them. After all, in another universe they had lost their son and grieved heavily as a result of it.</p>
<p>By now two years had passed since the incident with the manhole.</p>
<p>My doubts about these memories of mine were becoming stronger, as I began believing them to be no more than a strange dream.</p>
<p>'ChiZzzic! Joh...ra!'</p>
<p>It reminded me of Lena's voice which I had not heard in two years.</p>
<p>"Lena?"</p>
<p>I stood up and shouted loudly in the middle of class. Naturally there as no response and I was sent out to stand in the corridor as punishment for my outbreak.</p>
<p>Across from our school was a special needs school which I would occasionally stare out to. However, this time around I saw a face which I just happened to recognize.</p>
<p>"Don't tell me... could that me Melpomene?"</p>
<p>There was no plausible explanation for this since here face looked exactly like that of Melpomene's from my memories.</p>
<p>Whether or not I actually could hear Lena's voice might have been in question, but for me, this resemblance to Melpomene was more concrete proof that I wasn't entirely crazy.</p>
<p>Completely ignoring my punishment of waiting out in the corridor, I ran towards the exit, hell bent on reaching the other school. Unfortunately the school monitor had seen me and apprehended me before I could cross the gates.</p>
<p>"Crazy kid! Why did you run to the other school all of a sudden?"</p>
<p>The school monitor proceeded to slap my across the cheek a few times, but I didn't even feel the sting as my mind was still on Melpomene.</p>
<p>Ever since that day I would wait by that schools gate from early in the morning when classes would start, and then once again the in afternoon when they would end. I would often be caught and brought before that school's head disciplinary teacher who was angry with my actions. However I would Alway tell him that I was waiting to meet a student who studied here.</p>
<p>They also tried to bring my parents into it, but it seems that they believed that I had simply found my first love and was simply obsessed.</p>
<p>A few months passed in that fashion, but I had yet to see her again. Perhaps a normal person would have given up at this point, but not me. Part of what drove me so much was the desire to prove that my memories were more than mere fantasy.</p>
<p>Rain or shine, I would be by that schools gate to watch the students enter and leave, gaining the nickname of Dandelion for my strange behavior.</p>
<p>Finally, after six months of stalking, I was given permission to enter and look through the classes to find my mystery girl. But, after going classroom by classroom, I had yet to catch sight of Melpomene.</p>
<p>It was to be expected, after all I had been sitting by the gate and watching every student enter and leave for the past six months. It had all been a dead end. I was standing there, by one of the classroom doors, feeling frustrated and defeated. When the adjacent faculty door opened and a young looking female teacher, who looked more like a student came out.</p>
<p>"Oh, you must be that Dandelion, still haven't found her yet?"</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>"Oh, then maybe she just isn't in school right now.</p>
<p>"I've been looking for the past six months."</p>
<p>"Okay, then let me check the records to see if there was a student which transferred out around that time. Do you have a phone number?"</p>
<p>I returned home after giving her my number. My parents upon seeing how depressed I looked just give me a pat on the back to try to cheer me up.</p>
<p>Returning to my room, I jumped on my bed and stared at the ceiling dejectedly.</p>
<p>"In the end was it all a dream? Lena's voice, Melpomene's face?</p>
<p>I punched the wall in anger and tried to fall asleep.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 155</p>
<p>Ring! Ring!</p>
<p>I had slept in that morning, seeing as it was a Saturday, but was rudely awaken by the ringing of my phone.</p>
<p>"Ugh... it's just an unknown number."</p>
<p>I would very rarely receive calls from people other than my parents, so after dismissing the call, I fell back asleep. However, a few minutes later the phone rang again.</p>
<p>"What...."</p>
<p>It was only then that I remembered that I had given my phone number to the young teacher just the other day, when I had almost lost all hope.</p>
<p>After listening what she had to say, I was jumping with joy.</p>
<p>"Can I truly meet her?"</p>
<p>"Well... it might be a bit difficult in this case since she has transferred abroad."</p>
<p>"Where has she gone, please tell me!"</p>
<p>Following my insistence, she ended up relenting and informed me that she had transferred schools to Brazil, completely on the other side of the globe, following her parents who were diplomats.</p>
<p>For a regular high schooler it would be unthinkable to go all the way to Brazil to meet her. Not to mention, what would I even say to her if we were to meet up? She was not likely to even know me, so how should I try and convince her that my memories aren't mere fantasy?</p>
<p>I would only end up be treated like some nutcase.</p>
<p>Just as I hung up the phone, the reality hit me. It was like a turning point, where I truly didn't know whether or not to believe my own memories.</p>
<p>'Chiiizzic Johra? Can you hear me? I... it's hards to make contact because there are so few nanobots left. Chiizzic'</p>
<p>It was Lena's voice which rang in my mind.</p>
<p>"Lena? Lena!"</p>
<p>Although she wasn't able to answer back, it had definitely not been my imagination. It was the first time that Lena had strung together such a long sentence in this world.</p>
<p>"So it was not all just a mere dream."</p>
<p>Hot tears began to flow as I finally had more confidence in my memories.</p>
<p>"I definitely have to meet up with Melpomene, maybe she'll even remember some stuff as well."</p>
<p>It may have been seen by others as a reckless decision, but I worked part-time in a fast food restaurant for a whole year in order to save enough money for the trip. Gaining my parents' approval, in the summer of my 5th High school year, I sent her a letter letting her know of my intentions to visit, and hopped on a plane bound for Brazil.</p>
<p>"Johra, is it okay to go meet her like this?"</p>
<p>In past year Lena had recovered and we were now capable of having a conversation.</p>
<p>"There must be a reason that Gaia sent me back here, so I need to meet her at least once. Why else would Melpomene be in this world?"</p>
<p>It might have been an urgent matter seeing how quickly Gaia sent me away, but I had missed my chance at meeting her when we were still living close by. So now, I had no choice but to take the longer route and meet her all the way in Brazil, two years later.</p>
<p>I couldn't waste anymore time. After a few transfers in order to ensure the cheapest flight tickets, I had finally arrived in Brazil.</p>
<p>It was in a completely different hemisphere, so although it was summer in Korea, it was winter here in Brazil. Luckily since the country was relatively close to the equator, their winter was more like autumn temperature back in Korea.</p>
<p>While waiting at the airport for my ride to arrive, I had Lena look up any relevant information about Brazil.</p>
<p>Tap Tap</p>
<p>I turned around and find myself facing a 45 year old korean woman.</p>
<p>"Could you be...."</p>
<p>"The you are the one who sent the letter?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"I was worried that you'd be some strange student, but you seem fine. Still, I'm quite interested as to what would compel you to come so far after just once seeing someone in passing."</p>
<p>We drove for some time, before arriving at the gates of a decently sized mansion. It was a decently sized home on the outskirts of the city which had been provided to her family due to her father's position as a diplomat.</p>
<p>Ding! Dong!</p>
<p>"Who is it?"</p>
<p>I heard Melpomene sweet voice through the intercom.</p>
<p>"Open up, I've brought the student."</p>
<p>"Really?"</p>
<p>The door opened and I cool feel Melpomene aura, despite her looks being somewhat different.</p>
<p>"Uh... hi..."</p>
<p>She hesitated for a while but finally responded.</p>
<p>"Have we met before?"</p>
<p>"Just in passing, but you felt familiar."</p>
<p>"You came all the way here just because you thought I was familiar?"</p>
<p>Her mother had already explained to her the situation, but now that she first it first hand it still sounded incredible.</p>
<p>"I don't know why it is, but I couldn't stop thinking about you."</p>
<p>"You're a student visiting from afar, so you can stay here a couple of days."</p>
<p>Her mother gave me permission to stay at their home for a few days. Later that night, Melpomene sneaked into my room.</p>
<p>Shh!</p>
<p>She brought her finger to my mouth then pulled my hand as we escaped the compound. We wandered around for about 30 minutes before ending up in a secluded park.</p>
<p>"Are you wondering how it is that I can walk so well despite not being able to see?"</p>
<p>"Well, yes."</p>
<p>"I rather like walking in the parc at night, the quiet allows me to enjoy the nature, so after coming so many times and falling so often, I finally memorised the route.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence as we focused on the chirping of a grasshopper nearby.</p>
<p>"Is this also some kind of magic?"</p>
<p>"It seems more like hard work and persistence if you ask me."</p>
<p>"Haha, I've dreamt of Gods and Magic. I've dreamt that I could see and shape the world as I wished."</p>
<p>I stared at her pensively, it seemed that she also had quite a few memories.</p>
<p>"It might sound strange, but when I heard that you'd be coming to visit me from Korea, I thought you were my prince charming on his white horse, coming to whisk me away on some fairy tail. That it would mean I wasn't just some crazy girl with all these strange dreams.</p>
<p>"You aren't crazy, I also have the same dreams!"</p>
<p>"What? What did you say?"</p>
<p>"I also have the same dreams"</p>
<p>"Hoho I might really believe you... I just might.</p>
<p>She began to tear up as she started to believe that her dreams would come true.</p>
<p>"Lena, are you ready?"</p>
<p>"I think I should be able to momentarily interrupt the magic interference and access the Sephiroth network, but it would only be for a short time and I won't be able to do it again for a while.</p>
<p>"That's fine, on my signal."</p>
<p>"Who are you talking to?"</p>
<p>I answered her with a smile.</p>
<p>"Just this once, I can show you a miracle. 3... 2... 1... Now!"</p>
<p>Just as my countdown ended I changed her life with a very specific power.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 156</p>
<p>Using my connection to the Sephiroth network I managed to cure her blindness.</p>
<p>"Wow... to think that I could finally see something, even if its a bit blurry...."</p>
<p>"It will take some time for your eyes to adjust, but from here on out you'll be able to see."</p>
<p>Hug!</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Thank you! You truly were my Prince charming!"</p>
<p>I was caught unawares when she suddenly leapt into my arms, but the smell her fresh womanly shampoo was out of this world.</p>
<p>"Did you just fix my eyesight using magic?"</p>
<p>She asked me, as our faces were just 5 cm from each other.</p>
<p>"Well, kind of?"</p>
<p>"Then you came to take me back?"</p>
<p>"Yes, just not right now, it's still quite a complicated situation."</p>
<p>I heard some sounds coming from afar. It seemed that her parents had found out she was missing and were tracking her down.</p>
<p>"We should go back."</p>
<p>"Okay."</p>
<p>Although her mother was quite angry about her disappearing act, it was completely forgotten about when she learned that she could now see.</p>
<p>The very next morning she was rushed to the hospitable to be taken care of. I followed them there and painted a teleportation array in the hospital's basement, that way when I fully regained access to my magic I could return here to take her back.</p>
<p>Leaving her a note, I flew back to Korea.</p>
<p>We kept in touch, exchanging letters and the occasional phone calls. I was just glad to know that she was still doing well. Now that I was certain that my dreams were in fact true, I decided to enjoy my current life to the fullest. This continued until about 1 month away from my college entrance exams.</p>
<p>"Johra I've received a message."</p>
<p>Lena's voice rang out in my mind, I now knew better than to answer her outloud and continued to pretend to study.</p>
<p>"Gaia has opened up a permanent bridge to the other world, you can go there anytime at these coordinates."</p>
<p>I became excited, thinking that this had been long overdue. After class, I went to a secluded area and had a talk with Lena.</p>
<p>"Can you now use magic?"</p>
<p>"Yes, I should be able to access the Sephiroth network up to four more times in a row and it would take 10 days to recharge.</p>
<p>"Hmm... so that disturbance is Metatron's doing?"</p>
<p>"Right, he's installed several apparatuses across the planet which interfere with magic. It seems that he was keen on creating an environment for humans which didn't really on any magic."</p>
<p>"I see, but even if I return to my other world, I still want to make sure that Earth isn't destroyed like last time."</p>
<p>"You want to change the future?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Once I establish a link with Machina, we should have greater access to magic, but it might still get complicated is Metatron were to show up."</p>
<p>"Would we really be at that much of a disadvantage?"</p>
<p>"Yeah, pretty much, but don't worry too much about it, you still have me, remember?"</p>
<p>"Okay!"</p>
<p>I made my way to the coordinates provided by Gaia, which brought me to a building in the outskirts of the city which was under construction. I waited until night time, before sneaking in and crossing to the other side.</p>
<p>"Johra!"</p>
<p>thud!</p>
<p>I was tackled to the ground by the combined effort of Valenor and Viezda. Valenor looked to be at least 10 years old, whereas Viezda's complexion had completely recovered and she seemed to be doing much better.</p>
<p>"How have you two been?"</p>
<p>"Gaia took good care of us."</p>
<p>"How long have I been away?"</p>
<p>Valenor put up five fingers.</p>
<p>"Five months?"</p>
<p>Smack!</p>
<p>Valenor slapped me across the cheek</p>
<p>"Ouch!"</p>
<p>"Bad hubby! Five years! You should have visited sooner!"</p>
<p>Seen her tearful face, I forgotten the pain on my cheek and hugged her lovingly. I took some time to properly explain my situation and then bid them goodbye as I returned to Earth. I had to immediately begin my preparations to deal with Metatorn.</p>
<p>"Lena, how are things going?"</p>
<p>"Everything is well, we can now ignore the magic jamming as Machina's created a direct link to the network."</p>
<p>"Good, but we should destroy those jammers just in case.</p>
<p>"Alright!"</p>
<p>We created a teleportation array and arrived at the origin of magic disruption.</p>
<p>"Huhu~ So this was one of the things responsible for blocking out magic on Earth."</p>
<p>It was a large hybrid of magic and science, including Magic arrays, Magic stones and a mechanic component.</p>
<p>Shooc</p>
<p>I brought down Excalibur on the whole thing and it began melting right through it.</p>
<p>"Next one Lena!"</p>
<p>I teleported away and spent the whole day destroying all 144 of those jammers that were spread around the planet. I left the one on Seoul mountain for last and took care of it during the night.</p>
<p>"Huh, I can't believe I spent so much time doing this, I have an important exam coming up! "</p>
<p>I looked up into the sky and laughed helplessly.</p>
<p>"There is still one that remains on a orbiting meteorite?"</p>
<p>"That's true Johra, but it would be hard to get there, unless you created some kind of spaceship."</p>
<p>"It should be fine, we still have a lot of time and don't need to take care of it right away."</p>
<p>"I will prepare a step by step plan, oh and Gnoss' birth should be around the corner."</p>
<p>"Do you have a specific time and location?"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>The time frame Lena provided was six months from now, which would be after my College entrance exams.</p>
<p>"What do you think about giving him some of your nanobots, Lena?"</p>
<p>"Okay, I'll prepare for that."</p>
<p>"Good."</p>
<p>Six months later I hid myself in the adjacent room of the hospital where the baby Gnoss was born, and spread the nanobots to him. With them, he would at least be quite safe since the Rohim's shield could defend him from pretty much anything save for Metatorn himself.</p>
<p>After accomplishing the task it felt like most of my work here was now done.</p>
<p>"Johra."</p>
<p>I heard my name called one night, returning from drinking out with my friends to find Metatron standing in the middle of my living room.</p>
<p>My whole body froze and my hairs stood up in fear. Excalibur was kept securely in the closest, and it was impossible to face Metatorn with Lena alone. Still, I played it cool and answered him.</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, Metatron?"</p>
<p>"You are ruining the future."</p>
<p>"Huhu~ Wasn't it you who told me that it was all set in stone and couldn't be modified?"</p>
<p>"How dare you Johra! The purity of the universes...."</p>
<p>"How annoying, haven't you learned this by now? The future is constantly in flux, it is like a certain planned destination but with certain allowances and isn't fixed.</p>
<p>"What...?"</p>
<p>"How do you think it was possible for me to affect the present reality and have it differ from the past one?"</p>
<p>"It is all because of you, you trash which has contaminated the universes!"</p>
<p>As we conversed I slowly and naturally made my way towards the closet.</p>
<p>"Well, how do you even know that Alpha and Omega were part of the eternal flow from the beginning of time, perhaps they too were the product of another's intervention."</p>
<p>"You are the source of all problems, that is my conclusion, now pick up your sword!"</p>
<p>Metatron seemed to have guessed my intentions of going for Excalibur, and was even confident enough to let me grab it.</p>
<p>I took hold of Excalibur just as Metatron released his powers. As our magic clashed, his face began to distort. I came out ahead as Excalibur was an amplified version of Abbadon's powers, whereas Metatron had only received a limited version of Abbadon's magic.</p>
<p>I watched his arm disintegrate and turn to dust. He tried to hit me with his last remaining fist, but his other arm suffered the same fate.</p>
<p>"It was a good idea to surprise me like this, but you shouldn't have allowed me to grab ahold of this sword."</p>
<p>I spoke in a relaxed manner now that I had the upper hand and he had lost both of his arms.</p>
<p>Metatron seemed to have lost all reason and was incredibly desperate.</p>
<p>"I can't believe that I've been defeated. You've already managed to change the future, setting it on a completely new path in a way that Abbadon and the purity of the universes will never return."</p>
<p>"Hmm... well I do feel a bit sorry for you, but I still can't forgive you for all the massacres you've committed."</p>
<p>"In that case let us die together! In that way I'll at least have managed to eliminate the trash and the universe will once again undergo its stage of reduction and reincarnation, even if I won't be around to witness it!"</p>
<p>"Hey, just wha...?"</p>
<p>Wooong!</p>
<p>The next moment Metatron used his remaining powers to self-destruct in the center of his body. I immediately used Excalibur to massively slow down the speed which it occurred at, but likewise Metatorn had used all his mastery of time to speed up the process. Fortunately Excalibur's prowess slightly exceeded his, which bought me precious seconds to think.</p>
<p>"That lunatic, by self-destructing he will take half of the known universes down with him!"</p>
<p>"Johra, the teleport array is ready."</p>
<p>"Where to?"</p>
<p>"Just create a place, you now have full access to the Sephiroth network."</p>
<p>"Create one?"</p>
<p>I then recalled my strongest skill [Creation of Time and Space], which I promptly used with a swish of my hand.</p>
<p>"Let there be light!"</p>
<p>"We've observed the creation of your new universe, locking on the location with the teleportation array, 3...2...1... Go!"</p>
<p>I then disappeared along with Metatron's contained explosion and reappeared in a microcosm of space.</p>
<p>"Damn, won't we now get caught up in the explosion?"</p>
<p>The Rohim shield had immediately flickered and then given out, unable to contain the explosion any longer and even Excalibur melted down when exposed to it.</p>
<p>"We no longer have access to the Sephiroth network as it doesn't extend to this new space you've created. This time, I will make sure that at least you'd be able to return."</p>
<p>They were Lena's last words before we both were caught in the explosion.</p>
<p>"Lena? Lena!"</p>
<p>I called out to her, but there was no answer. I was now in limbo, floating through time and space. My arms and legs had disappeared as a result of the explosion, but my torso and head were still intact. I was beginning to lose consciousness, but hung on desperately, unwilling to give in to death.</p>
<p>"Take my hand."</p>
<p>I welcomed the familiar voice of Gaia.</p>
<p>As I grabbed a hold of her I reappeared in a flash of light and Gaia instantly helped me recover my missing limbs.</p>
<p>"Odin, Skyfather, you're both here."</p>
<p>"How was experiencing the beginning of time?"</p>
<p>Skyfather looked at me questioningly.</p>
<p>"The beginning of time?"</p>
<p>"You might not be aware of it, but Metatron's explosion was like the Big Bang, the beginning of all the universes.</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"Did Lena do something at the very last minute? She must have spread herself across the universe after the explosion, leaving behind enough magic to recreate you, Johra."</p>
<p>"What are you talking about, I can't understand any of it."</p>
<p>"You'll have to be responsible for ensuring the eternity of the universes, but there is plenty of time before that becomes relevant so you can have a nice extended vacation until then."</p>
<p>"I don't get it."</p>
<p>"Now that Metatorn is gone, I have to shoulder all of his responsibilities..."</p>
<p>Gaia showed a disgruntled expression.</p>
<p>"Still, now Metatron is a part of us all, there is also a part of Lena and Johra across all the universes...."</p>
<p>"My head is begging to hurt just thinking about it."</p>
<p>"Okay, head back for now, everyone is waiting for you."</p>
<p>"Alright then."</p>
<p>As I stepped through the door, the three Gods continued their discussion.</p>
<p>"So now that the creation of the universes is done, the rest...."</p>
<p>"Ugh! I'm getting a headache."</p>
<p>"Is it fine for the universe to flow in this direction? The purity...."</p>
<p>This discussion between the three of the continued until the end of time.</p>
<p>"Do you think that Johra was the right choice?"</p>
<p>"Gaia asked Skyfather?"</p>
<p>"Yes, and Level 1 Skeleton Soldier was the perfect starting point."</p>
<p>"Hey Skyfather, that one was my idea!"</p>
<p>Ha ha ha!</p>
<p>Odin laughed heartily as he watched the heated debate between the other two. He still had no idea why one would need to start as a Level 1 Skeleton.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Epilogue</p>
<p>I reappeared back in my room on Earth.</p>
<p>"Lena?"</p>
<p>There was no answer, perhaps she had completely vanished due to the explosion.</p>
<p>I walked into what had now become a new apartment building as I stepped into the other world.</p>
<p>"Hmm… how was it already that we made teleportation arrays?"</p>
<p>I had watched Lena do it several times and had occasionally helped out, but it was my first time doing it alone.</p>
<p>After some experimentation I was able to arrive back at the Pit and was warmly greeted by those closest to me.</p>
<p>I was now in contact with Machina, seeing if there was a way to bring back Lena.</p>
<p>"Well… I could restore her, but it wouldn't include all of her memories, it would be more of a substitute.</p>
<p>"Hmm…"</p>
<p>I returned to Pit, disappointed with the news, but didn't share it with the others. I enjoyed my time on both Earth and this world, but still my longing for Lena grew.</p>
<p>Years passed and news reached me of a genius which looked like a younger Gnoss. I saw him on the news. A child prodigy just 6 years old that was able to solve graduate level problems. It was then that a voice appeared in my mind.</p>
<p>"How have you been?"</p>
<p>It was Lena's remnant nanobots which I had left in Gnoss. I had completed forgotten about that fact! I immediately left to meet up with this child prodigy. Through the internet I was able to find out where he was staying and by dawn the next day I was standing outside his home.</p>
<p>Ding Dong!</p>
<p>I heard a familiar voice through the intercom.</p>
<p>"Johra?"</p>
<p>It was Gnoss. It seemed that he could recognize me, but it couldn't have been a memory, so most probably Lena had informed him of me.</p>
<p>"Gnoss, or should call you Phil?"</p>
<p>He shook his head in response.</p>
<p>"I'm Gnoss."</p>
<p>"Okay, now hand Lena over."</p>
<p>I cut straight to the point.</p>
<p>"Haha Yes, she said it's fine for her to return to Johra now that Metatron is gone."</p>
<p>"Right."</p>
<p>"My mission is to block the future attacks which have been set in motion by Metatron, you can go now."</p>
<p>Gross asked me to leave with a sad face.</p>
<p>"Before that… Gnoss, can't we be friends once more?"</p>
<p>It took me some effort to say, but it finally came out.</p>
<p>"Hmm… but I heard from Lena that Johra is still wary of me."</p>
<p>It is true that most of my life I had perhaps been to suspicious of his motives, but the results were always good</p>
<p>"That was my own fault, if I had believed in you more, I could have avoided many hardships."</p>
<p>Gnoss gave me a confused look, before smiling.</p>
<p>"It seems that after all these years, we've truly become friends."</p>
<p>He reached out and we shook hands.</p>
<p>"Well good friend of mine, it seems my memories have returned."</p>
<p>"Ah… wait, what?"</p>
<p>"I'm not sure how it is that I now have Metatron's memories, but it seems that I'm now his reincarnation."</p>
<p>"What….?"</p>
<p>It was my turn to be stupefied, I had never imagined that Gnoss would have been Metatorns reincarnation.</p>
<p>I tried to pull back my hand but it wouldn't budge.</p>
<p>"It it wasn't for you, Johra, this world would have disappeared and we wouldn't have been able to become friends."</p>
<p>His smile made my back break into cold sweats, but I couldn't deny the veracity of his words.</p>
<p>"Yes, friends for life."</p>
<p>"Hahaha I think I truly like you Johra. You may caused me to die a couple gruesome deaths, but I can't help but like you!"</p>
<p>His words rang in my mind, and then he disappeared without leaving a trace. Ever since that moment I had never met him again, despite all the times I've looked.</p>
<p>I checked all the magic traps which Metatron had previously created, but couldn't find any clues. I also asked Gaia, Skyfather and Odin if they knew anything, but they claimed to not know his whereabouts, despite giving me a small smirk.</p>
<p>"Damn… I'm worried that Gnoss will do something crazy again."</p>
<p>Time flew by and with my four wives I ended up having thirteen children. To this day both worlds remain at peace, but deep within me remained a mix of anxiety and expectations when I thought of the future to come.</p>
<p>Thanks to all who have managed to stick with me throughout all the ups and down in the story. I've enjoyed my time translating it and couldn't have done it all without your constant support. For those yet unaware, my second project will be Master of Strength (MoS) which I have just begun and should be start posting within the coming weeks. Thanks again for your unwavering support,</p>
