<p>Instead of hostility, his expression was now filled with questions.</p>
<p>However, this was very brief.</p>
<p>Just like the calm before a storm.</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s hard to believe, but I need you. To be exact, I need you to become the Duke rather than Leo.”</p>
<p>The moment the name ‘Leo’ was said, his tension rose insurmountably once more.</p>
<p>His face, which was already ashen, turned even more white—to the point that he was almost blue.</p>
<p>His lips were trembling.</p>
<p>Only by the mention of Leo’s name.</p>
<p>“I’ll make you Duke Carter. So, walk down this path with me.”</p>
<p>Rosetta stopped speaking and let the silence stretch between them.</p>
<p>His eyes, which quivered as though there was an earthquake within him, shifted sharply to the floor.</p>
<p>“That… doesn’t make sense.”</p>
<p>Rather than an answer to Rosetta, it sounded like he was talking to himself. Even with bitterness filling his voice, there was a sense of helplessness.</p>
<p>Soon, his white teeth bit into his lower lip.</p>
<p>And with his lips being dry and chapped, blood was drawn.</p>
<p>A line of red blood trickled down the side of his lips.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there didn’t seem to be any sign that those white teeth would let go of his lips.</p>
<p>The gaze that fell to the ground did not look up to meet her golden irises again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the other side of this conversation, Cassion felt as though he was about to burst because his head was swirling with complicated thoughts.</p>
<p>‘Just who the hell is this woman.’</p>
<p>He felt like sh*t, but he momentarily forgot all the pain in his body because of the woman in front of him.</p>
<p>Chaos. Confusion.</p>
<p>Perhaps everything could be summed up like that.</p>
<p>Rosetta Valentine. Why was the illegitimate ducal princess of the Valentine Duchy here, doing all this for him?</p>
<p>‘Be the Duke instead of Leo?’</p>
<p>He almost laughed in vain.</p>
<p>Or, fear.</p>
<p>He had never stopped to look back just because of something like that, so he never dared to imagine it.</p>
<p>All he knew and all he wanted was survival.</p>
<p>He needed to survive. He was a man who lived only to endure.</p>
<p>But after enduring…</p>
<p>After that…</p>
<p>‘Have I ever thought of what happens after that?’</p>
<p>It felt as though there was lead weighing his chest down.</p>
<p>For him, survival was his revenge.</p>
<p>He thought it was the only thing he could do—to show them that he continued to survive despite their attempts at his life.</p>
<p>But, until when?</p>
<p>Would he end up dying after only enduring all this time?</p>
<p>‘Ah, why did this thought even come up.’</p>
<p>Amidst the confusion and misery that filled his mind, Cassion raised his head.</p>
<p>And as saw Rosetta, he almost shuddered.</p>
<p>She was so calm.</p>
<p>Even so, there was a confident look behind her eyes.</p>
<p>As a result, he couldn’t understand what it meant.</p>
<p>‘She’ll make me the Duke, she says.’</p>
<p>It was a future that he had never dared to consider, and all it took for him to think about it were her calm words.</p>
<p>It would be a future where his purpose for living was not only to ‘survive’, but a future where he could know peace and safety.</p>
<p>But.</p>
<p>That wasn’t possible for him.</p>
<p>‘This is definitely a trap.’</p>
<p>Cassion tried to think of it as rationally as he could.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s words were surely false. Obviously, there must be another reason.</p>
<p>‘Is she a person that Stepmother sent?’</p>
<p>Usually, other families interfered with the succession race of other families the moment the possible heirs were of the right age.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, Cassion had just become an adult, and the reason for the carriage accident must be that.</p>
<p>What if Rosetta was sent here after the carriage accident just so he would be gone for good?</p>
<p>The moment he opened his mind and truly considered the position of Duke, then…</p>
<p>‘It would be enough reason to get rid of me once and for all.’</p>
<p>However, this conclusion had nothing to prove it.</p>
<p>What did the Princess of Valentine have to do with Duchess Carter? Why would she need to play this role to trap him?</p>
<p>If it was only to tempt him, it would have been better to send a member of the Carter family.</p>
<p>Not a person from a family who constantly kept the Carter Duchy in check.</p>
<p>If it was from his own family members, their sweet whispers would be all the more attractive.</p>
<p>‘Then what the hell could it be?’</p>
<p>While Cassion struggled and contemplated alone, Rosetta was still relaxed.</p>
<p>She was sitting calmly, combing through her hair as though to say ‘Take your time’.</p>
<p>Cassion continued to sort through his chaotic thoughts, uneasy with the unknown variables thrown at his face.</p>
<p>‘What the hell is her angle? Why was she trying to appease me with a ‘transaction’ that doesn’t even make sense?’</p>
<p>In fact, no matter how confident she looked, the promise of him being the head of the family could never be true.</p>
<p>Because a person who had no ability to wield magic could never be the head of the Carter Duchy.</p>
<p>The Carter family, and even the branch family.</p>
<p>They had a high-nosed pride with ‘magic’.</p>
<p>No matter how distinguished one’s background was, this family was one that recognized an individual’s capabilities first and foremost.</p>
<p>From generation to generation, the Carter Duchy’s veins had been brimming with mana, with bright talents in mana application and affinity. That’s why the successor who would become the head of the family was indisputable to all.</p>
<p>If someone as incapable as him would become Duke…</p>
<p>‘There would be a coup d’état.’</p>
<p>It would be a significant disgrace if Cassion was the one who’d succeed the Duchy.</p>
<p>There would surely be a lot of opposition.</p>
<p>Oh. Was she aiming for this?</p>
<p>The woman in front of him was the Princess of Valentine.</p>
<p>It would make sense if the Valentine Duchy would want to support him in the succession race to cause disorder within the Carter Duchy.</p>
<p>In fact, even if this wasn’t a perfect hypothesis, this was the likeliest one he could come up with.</p>
<p>After gulping once, Cassion opened his lips—resolutely.</p>
<p>“Do you plan to use me? You’ll make me Duke just so the Carter family would be a mess?”</p>
<p>Unyielding red eyes met her golden irises.</p>
<p>As their eyes met, Rosetta blinked.</p>
<p>‘What did he just say?’</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 21</p>
<p>What Cassion said was quite a plausible deduction.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was the best assumption he could come up with.</p>
<p>Just one problem though. It’s all wrong.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, when Cassion said his family name with such a solemn tone, Rosetta felt a bit embarrassed for him.</p>
<p>It felt like she was watching someone shouting the wrong answer with a confident expression.</p>
<p>After thinking about what to say, Rosetta slowly opened her lips.</p>
<p>“It’s good to have a lot of imagination, but no—you’re wrong.”</p>
<p>“Lies.”</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>As his grim tone deepened, Rosetta’s urge to roll her eyes grew.</p>
<p>However, instead of doing this, Rosetta answered once more with endless patience.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you misunderstand. Since I already said everything I needed to say, just remember that I need you. My goal is to make you the Duke of Carter. It’s up to you whether or not you take my hand—but.”</p>
<p>When her long declaration was cut off at once, the pressure that she exuded was considerable.</p>
<p>To the point where the face of the woman who had been relaxed all this time looked terribly cold.</p>
<p>“But?”</p>
<p>Cassion was anxious as he stared at her closed red lips. When Rosetta had closed her lips, Cassion blinked vacantly. Still, he could feel tension on his back as he continued to be cautious.</p>
<p>‘Should I stop here for today?’</p>
<p>As she stared at Cassion, she thought it would be better if she wouldn’t speak more.</p>
<p>If she talked more without thinking much, this would only raise his defenses more.</p>
<p>She didn’t have to do everything in a day.</p>
<p>It’s not that she had a lot of time, but it also didn’t mean that she had no time at all for this.</p>
<p>As she concluded like this, Rosetta kept her lips closed.</p>
<p>And a curve dawned upon her lips.</p>
<p>“You’ll hear the answer tomorrow, so just rest for tonight. Come to think of it, you’re a patient, but I pushed you too hard.”</p>
<p>“What are you even…”</p>
<p>“I’ll come back when it’s bright out tomorrow. Until then, rest well and think about what I had proposed. Oh, and if you need anything, feel free to call an attendant.”</p>
<p>“Wait…”</p>
<p>“But be careful not to show your eye color when you call any employees, understand?”</p>
<p>Despite Cassion’s bewilderment, Rosetta continued to barrage him with these words.</p>
<p>At her last question, he didn’t even realize that he had nodded.</p>
<p>Satisfied with Cassion’s apparent obedience, Rosetta looked around the room one last time, then waved her hand warmly at him.</p>
<p>It was an elegant gesture, like a flower tree swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll see you tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>It was very natural, the way she said it. Cassion couldn’t even protest, even until Rosetta had turned her back and went towards the door.</p>
<p>It was only after he saw her slender fingers hold the doorknob that he snapped out of it and felt that he had to hold onto her.</p>
<p>“No, just wait a second, Princess Val—ugh.”</p>
<p>He called out to her hurriedly, but his words were drowned out by a groan.</p>
<p>His body was still in a bad condition, and he suddenly felt burdened by his injuries as he groaned painfully.</p>
<p>Creeeak.</p>
<p>At the merciless sound of the door creaking open, Cassion clutched his side and raised his head.</p>
<p>The first thing he saw was her fluttering hair.</p>
<p>And her face as she passed by.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked back at Cassion for a moment, not saying anything.</p>
<p>‘What a cold expression.’</p>
<p>This was his only thought.</p>
<p>“Good night.”</p>
<p>But the voice that flowed through her lips was sweet. Then soon, the door closed.</p>
<p>Rosetta had already left the room, but Cassion’s eyes were still locked on the spot where she had just been.</p>
<p>“Don’t… go.”</p>
<p>The words that he couldn’t utter earlier leaked out as though they had burst from his lips.</p>
<p>Cassion’s eyes trembled as he called out belatedly.</p>
<p>‘What am I doing right now.’</p>
<p>After being left alone, the pain seemed to come to him again.</p>
<p>And his mouth was dry.</p>
<p>He slumped and held his head with both hands for a moment, but something caught his eye.</p>
<p>‘That’s…’</p>
<p>It was the cloak that Rosetta had taken off.</p>
<p>It was a black cloak that blended perfectly with the darkness.</p>
<p>His red eyes shone sharply.</p>
<p>And they continued to glimmer as he looked out the window.</p>
<p>“Urk…”</p>
<p>Cassion clutched his side and stood up.</p>
<p>Every time he moved, his body screamed in protest, but this was bearable.</p>
<p>Because his entire life had been filled with wounds and pain that he needed to endure.</p>
<p>He limped towards the chair.</p>
<p>To be exact, it was towards the pitch-black cloak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With Rosetta’s back to the door, she heard the sound of him limping.</p>
<p>As she did, she smiled wryly.</p>
<p>‘You sure are trying hard.’</p>
<p>Without even needing to look at him, she knew that Cassion was struggling to walk.</p>
<p>She left the cloak inside the room on purpose.</p>
<p>From the moment she delayed the answer to tomorrow, she knew that Cassion was going to try and escape.</p>
<p>Rosetta was a suspicious person to him, so he would definitely try to leave the place where he was brought.</p>
<p>So if he was going to escape, Rosetta left the cloak there so he could at least hide his face.</p>
<p>‘When should I go out?’</p>
<p>Rosetta tilted her head to the side and estimated the time that had passed, and by the time the man’s footsteps had stopped, she stopped leaning on the door.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to take an evening stroll tonight.</p>
<p>‘I don’t really like playing tag.’</p>
<p>But it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>They weren’t on the same page yet, so she had to march to his beat for now.</p>
<p>Flick. With a light smile, Rosetta headed to her own room.</p>
<p>She needed to pick up another cloak since the one she had just now was with Cassion.</p>
<p>The sound of her footsteps along the hallway was quiet.</p>
<p>No, it was more than just quiet. There was no sound. Only the shadows flickered as she walked.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Although it was early summer, the night’s air was chilly.</p>
<p>The blue light of the hotel’s signboard touched the well-paved road as well.</p>
<p><strong>[ Larrington Hotel ]</strong></p>
<p>As Cassion read the sign, he grabbed the hood over his head.</p>
<p>He left the room Rosetta had given him.</p>
<p>Despite him being heavily injured, Cassion wore the cloak and escaped.</p>
<p>No matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t trust the woman who told him such a ridiculous reason for saving him.</p>
<p>It’s right to think that she saved him from death…</p>
<p>But he didn’t know if he should call him his ‘savior’.</p>
<p>A maid he once trusted had poisoned his tea.</p>
<p>An attendant who was polite to him had pushed him off the stairs.</p>
<p>His own father… abandoned him.</p>
<p>He was someone who was easily swayed by kindness, but it was hard for him to accept any of it because he had to pay the price for his blind faith.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>‘Yes. It’s hard to believe, but I need you. To be exact, I need you to become the Duke rather than Leo.’</p>
<p>Nonsense.</p>
<p>He went around in circles and thought about it many times, but the only conclusion he drew was that she was going to use him to bring chaos to the Carter family.</p>
<p>In the end, whatever she was planning, all he could think was that she would only use him and throw him away.</p>
<p>‘I’m sick and tired of it all.’</p>
<p>Just his stepmother and Leo were enough to send him over the edge.</p>
<p>He didn’t need to add another person in his life who’d only pin him down.</p>
<p>He was thankful that she saved him, but that was it. Since he was fine, all he had to do was go back safely and…</p>
<p>‘Go back?’</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>He laughed in vain.</p>
<p>It was miserable enough that he was on the brink of death but was resurrected back to life—but now, there was only one place where he could return to.</p>
<p>He felt lost.</p>
<p>The only place he could return to was the very place that threatened his life the most, and it was the very place that he should run away from at all costs.</p>
<p>It was like he was running endlessly on a mobius strip, going round and round without an end in sight.</p>
<p>Even as the familiar desolation greeted him, Cassion quickly pushed aside his emotions and moved his limp legs.</p>
<p>‘For now, I just need to leave.’</p>
<p>Seeing that this was a large hotel, there would be security nearby.</p>
<p>He would have to walk along the main road until he could find his way towards the shopping district.</p>
<p>Ironically, clouds began to cover the already dark night sky.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘I took the wrong turn.’</p>
<p>The man slumped down at a corner of an alley was in a terrible condition.</p>
<p>Cassion took in a rough breath as he clutched his side.</p>
<p>The breaths that left his throat were hot.</p>
<p>“Search harder. He couldn’t have gotten far.”</p>
<p>“He looks like a naïve young master… Once we catch him, we’ll have to teach him a lesson.”</p>
<p>The chortling voices weren’t far away.</p>
<p>And their footsteps were coming closer.</p>
<p>They were looking for Cassion.</p>
<p>‘Sh*t.’</p>
<p>Cassion had to resist the urge to curse out loud.</p>
<p>He could only lean against a wall.</p>
<p>And crouch low on the humid floor.</p>
<p>It even felt like blood was dripping down his side even as he pressed down tightly.</p>
<p>If he encountered those people in this state, he’d be crippled for sure.</p>
<p>‘Where did it all start to go wrong?’</p>
<p>He regretted his actions, but he didn’t know where it began.</p>
<p>People suddenly started chasing after him only a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>After the blue light of the hotel sign was left behind him, Cassion walked along the main road just as he had planned.</p>
<p>He continued to limp and struggle to move, but his body quickly adapted to the pain he felt.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 22</p>
<p>Cassion’s footsteps stopped.</p>
<p>This was already the third time.</p>
<p>No matter who it was that walked near him within the span of ten steps, his heart seemed to drop to the ground, so he would naturally stop walking.</p>
<p>His anxiety stopped him from taking any more steps.</p>
<p>The planned carriage accident…</p>
<p>He was a victim who survived.</p>
<p>It was the first time that he clearly felt death, so everyone passing by him looked suspicious in his eyes.</p>
<p>He was afraid that there would be people on his trail because he disappeared from the scene of the accident.</p>
<p>Pushing the carriage he was riding off a cliff was incomparable to just pushing him off the stairs like back then.</p>
<p>That’s why he was feeling incredibly anxious that someone was chasing after him to finish the deed.</p>
<p>If he returned home safely, he might be able to save himself for a while.</p>
<p>Once Leo and his mother had done something, they usually took some time to execute their next plan.</p>
<p>Knowing that they had received help from the Valentine Duchy’s Princess this time, they would feel more complacent for the time being.</p>
<p>However, if he would meet the person who would finish him off before he arrived home…</p>
<p>‘I’ll be dead on the spot.’</p>
<p>Cassion, who had thought until this point, weighed this on his mind.</p>
<p>It felt like his heart was going to stop because it kept pounding out of his chest.</p>
<p>Fear, anger—feelings that filled him that seemed to strangle him.</p>
<p>Just hiding underneath the hood of his cloak had its limits.</p>
<p>Huu. With a deep sigh, Cassion turned to the alley without any hesitation.</p>
<p>‘Let’s give up walking by the main road.’</p>
<p>The alley that was shrouded with the ‘darkness’ that he wished for.</p>
<p>He already knew which direction he must go, so he thought that it would be better if he went down the alley where there weren’t any people.</p>
<p>If anyone looked towards that place, they would naturally think that the quiet alley without any light was leagues more dangerous.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, his pounding heart was truly affected by the planned accident.</p>
<p>He was afraid of running into people, so he decided to avoid them.</p>
<p>What would be so different from playing hide-and-seek with your eyes covered?</p>
<p>And yet… Cassion belatedly realized that he had misjudged the situation.</p>
<p>He realized this when people popped out of the dark as he walked along the alleyway.</p>
<p>There were two people on the winding road.</p>
<p>They were both men, and their faces were red, seeming as though they were very drunk.</p>
<p>As he suddenly saw people on the path he needed to take, Cassion reflexively fixed the hood over his head.</p>
<p>He tried to hold his breath and blend into the shadows.</p>
<p>But just because he tried didn’t mean that he was successful.</p>
<p>The drunken men noticed Cassion.</p>
<p>He didn’t make eye contact with the men, but Cassion felt that one of them was looking at him.</p>
<p>Hiccup. The sound of the man’s hiccups echoed along the narrow alley.</p>
<p>“Huh? I’ve never seen your face before. No, wait, I can’t even see your face.”</p>
<p>Even though he was a few steps away, the stench of alcohol wafted through the man’s open mouth.</p>
<p>Cassion pretended not to hear anything and continued walking.</p>
<p>“Hey! Where are you going? You’re ignoring me?”</p>
<p>He heard the indignant voice behind him, but he continued his strides as though there was no one there.</p>
<p>And yet because he was only limping, he couldn’t move as fast as he wanted.</p>
<p>That’s why even as the drunkards were stumbling over their own feet, they were able to catch up to him in no time.</p>
<p>Tak.</p>
<p>A thick hand weighed heavily over the black cloak.</p>
<p>“Hey, are you really ignoring me? Do you know who I am, huh?!”</p>
<p>The indignant voice shouted even louder, echoing several times in that narrow alley.</p>
<p>The man, who yelled and expressed his anger, gripped Cassion’s shoulder and turned him around roughly.</p>
<p>The legs that barely kept him up faltered at once.</p>
<p>Cassion had barely managed to get this far, so he tucked face even deeper under the hood and bowed his head so that he wouldn’t be recognized.</p>
<p>‘Judging by the scent of alcohol, I don’t think they’ve been sent by Leo.’</p>
<p>Leo was a cool-headed schemer.</p>
<p>He was cruel and thorough.</p>
<p>Even if it was his own person who made a mistake, he would kick them out without hesitation. Either that, or he would severely punish them.</p>
<p>In short, it was impossible that a person who moved under his orders would drink alcohol during a mission.</p>
<p>As soon as Cassion realized that these men weren’t sent by Leo, he felt relieved.</p>
<p>Immediately after that relief, misery soon followed as he reflected on these thoughts.</p>
<p>But this wasn’t the time to do that.</p>
<p>‘These men were just looking for someone to pick a fight with.’</p>
<p>There were people of this kind in any alleyway.</p>
<p>Fools who thought that the dark alleys were their territory.</p>
<p>While Cassion was lost in thought, one of the drunk men continued to talk to him.</p>
<p>“Hey. If a person has a question, ya have to answer. Right now, I’m askin’ ya if you ignored me just now.”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey. Take it easy. This kid will get scared.”</p>
<p>The man who turned Cassion around was the one who kept yelling at him, and the man next to him kept giggling.</p>
<p>“No, this punk—hiccup—he’s ignoring me—hiccup.”</p>
<p>For a moment, Cassion thought of what he could say to get out of this situation, then he opened his lips and spoke with a polite tone.</p>
<p>“I’m not ignoring you. I’m just in a bit of a hurry because there’s somewhere I have to be, so I’d appreciate it if you could let me off.”</p>
<p>If anyone saw him like this now, they would point their fingers at him while asking him where his pride as a noble went, but Cassion was a realistic rather than prideful man.</p>
<p>There was no need to get swept into a fight when his body was already so injured.</p>
<p>Since it was a matter of getting out of this situation unscathed, it was simple for him to just bow his head. His pride wouldn’t be wounded.</p>
<p>However, the two men just wouldn’t let him go easily.</p>
<p>Rather, they seemed to have gotten more incensed because of his polite tone.</p>
<p>“Haha, what’s up with that? With the way you speak, it sounds to me like you’re a noble. Why did our oh so noble blue-blooded fella come to the back alleys alone?”</p>
<p>“Ahh, I know I know. Did’ja come to a place like this to find somethin’ fun? Because yer fancy banquet got a bit boring? But what should we do? If ya wanna have fun over here, it’s kinda a rule that ya gotta give money to poor people like us fellows.”</p>
<p>With a cheerful tone, his threatening hands jutted out to Cassion as if to peel off the hood over his head and reach into the pockets of a naïve, weak nobleman.</p>
<p>In a situation where he was suddenly threatened, Cassion bit his lower lip.</p>
<p>Huu.</p>
<p>The breath that came through his lips expressed his frustration.</p>
<p>‘About two people is still fine.’</p>
<p>His condition wasn’t the best, but that didn’t mean that he wouldn’t stand a chance against them. Especially since they were drunk.</p>
<p>They were right in assessing that Cassion was a mentally, physically weak nobleman.</p>
<p>As far as even his family, he was weak not just against other people.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy to live on the edge of his seat every single second.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just a coincidence that he survived thus far after learning how to sense the threats that reached him.</p>
<p>“Get your hand off me.”</p>
<p>Cassion warned the man whose hand was still on his cloak.</p>
<p>“What the…”</p>
<p>The man’s words stopped there.</p>
<p>Because Cassion grabbed the man’s arm and twisted it.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>As soon as his arm was twisted, the man screamed.</p>
<p>At the unexpected turn of events, the other man looked at them blankly, flustered.</p>
<p>But tension and anger quickly tinted their drunken eyes.</p>
<p>“Hey, let go of his arm!”</p>
<p>The previously stunned man rushed in with his fist heading towards Cassion, who let go of the arm he held and evaded the fist.</p>
<p>The bear-like man couldn’t beat his speed and instead rushed into the wall.</p>
<p>With a huge bang as he collided, the man lost consciousness.</p>
<p>The man who had his arm twisted was also rolling on the floor.</p>
<p>After looking at the two men, Cassion tried to leave this place in a hurry. But.</p>
<p>“What’s that.”</p>
<p>Surprised by the loud noise, the alley was blocked by other men.</p>
<p>As if they were on the same side as the first two men, they alternately looked at the faces of the drunkards lying on the floor, then at Cassion. Then, they shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“That punk!”</p>
<p>“Catch him!”</p>
<p>People began to chase after him one after another.</p>
<p>Two were easy enough, but it was impossible for Cassion to deal with more people in his current state.</p>
<p>Cassion was forced to turn around and run.</p>
<p>It felt as though his back was going to split in half, and it felt like his legs were being twisted, but it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>And so, back in the present.</p>
<p>He somehow escaped them and managed to hide himself, but that was all.</p>
<p>As he sat on the cold stone floor, he stared blankly at the night sky.</p>
<p>“He ain’t here.”</p>
<p>“Look harder. He was limping, so he couldn’t have gotten far. Once he’s caught, make it so that it’s impossible for him to walk at all.”</p>
<p>He continued to hear the voices of the persistent men who searched every corner.</p>
<p>He had to hold back even his breath.</p>
<p>How long had it been? He couldn’t hear their voices anymore.</p>
<p>‘They might have given up.’</p>
<p>Thanks to the clouds covering the moon, he couldn’t guess just how long had passed.</p>
<p>Cassion silently struggled to his feet.</p>
<p>His body was stiff, so he had to hold onto the wall next to him for support.</p>
<p>However, the old walls wouldn’t withstand the weight of Cassion.</p>
<p>Rubble that fell from the wall bounced to the ground. The sound echoed.</p>
<p>‘Damn it.’</p>
<p>At the unexpected noise, Cassion forced himself even more to his feet faster, to leave this place somehow.</p>
<p>The sound of numb legs dragging across the floor could be heard.</p>
<p>And at the same time—</p>
<p>“Found ‘im.”</p>
<p>The man’s voice was louder than the sound of Cassion’s limping footsteps.</p>
<p>“Ah, sh*t.”</p>
<p>Seriously. All he could do now was laugh.</p>
<p>The threatening group of men slowly approached him. Cassion limped and took a few steps back.</p>
<p>Now, on his fifth step, Cassion’s back touched the wall behind him.</p>
<p>“Now let’s take a look at that face. How precious could that face be, huh?”</p>
<p>The man who fainted after hitting his own face against a wall smiled threateningly and prowled across the narrow alley.</p>
<p>There was no chance for Cassion to escape anymore, so he closed his eyes tightly.</p>
<p>Even if his body would become mangled, they wouldn’t be able to see the color of his eyes at all.</p>
<p>However, his resolve didn’t last long.</p>
<p>“What? After you ran away like that, you’re being harassed by these guys here?”</p>
<p>Because the familiar voice of that woman resonated in his ears.</p>
<p>His eyes widened and followed the sound of her voice.</p>
<p>Forward…</p>
<p>And, upward.</p>
<p>Underneath the hood over her head, her cascading silver hair could be seen fluttering against the wind.</p>
<p>Even in the dark, her golden eyes flashed clearly amidst her porcelain face.</p>
<p>His red lips were curled up as if amused.</p>
<p>Rosetta Valentine.</p>
<p>Sitting atop of an old building, she was strangely relaxed, an atmosphere that was out of place here.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>A beautiful voice and mesmerizing face that would captivate people and take their hearts away…</p>
<p>“This time as well, will you ask me to save you?”</p>
<p>‘Monster…’</p>
<p>Just like the one from the legends.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 23</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded and waited for Cassion’s answer.</p>
<p>She observed his stunned face after she spoke.</p>
<p>While silence stretched between the two, the men chasing after Cassion, one by one, turned their attention to Rosetta.</p>
<p>“And who the hell are ya?!”</p>
<p>“Hey, lady, you know this fella? You’re wearing a cloak, too, huh? Did you two get a matching pair? Huh? What kind of cloak is that even?”</p>
<p>The men joked amongst themselves below her.</p>
<p>“Why are you so far away? Come play with us, huh, lady?”</p>
<p>And it was unfortunate that they only spoke words that weren’t truly funny, yet they giggled even more.</p>
<p>Her golden irises coldly looked at the men, then she shifted her gaze back to Cassion.</p>
<p>It seemed like she cared about only Cassion.</p>
<p>“Answer me. I’m asking you if you want me to help you.”</p>
<p>This question proved that supposition. The men, who realized that they’d been ignored, turned red in the face.</p>
<p>“You there—you didn’t hear me?!”</p>
<p>“Come down here. Huh? You’re not coming down?!”</p>
<p>Their rough words now flooded the air.</p>
<p>Yet Rosetta’s gaze stayed on Cassion as their eyes met.</p>
<p>The man who huffed at Rosetta changed targets and turned back to Cassion.</p>
<p>“So you two know each other. What a pair you are for riling people up, huh? Okay, I got it. She’ll come down once you’re all bloody, right?”</p>
<p>As he cracked his knuckles, the large man approached Cassion.</p>
<p>When one person’s target changed, the rest followed suit and turned their attention to Cassion once more.</p>
<p>The sound of them cracking their joints filled the air.</p>
<p>Rosetta watched the situation from above, fiddling with a folding fan she brought with her.</p>
<p>Cassion hadn’t said anything yet.</p>
<p>He just looked at Rosetta without a word, then turned towards the men.</p>
<p>His eyes, covered beneath the shadow of the hood, were closed.</p>
<p>Like a prisoner waiting for his death penalty.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what the hell you’re thinking.’</p>
<p>The largest man there snatched Cassion by the collar, the man’s hand almost the size of a pot lid. He lifted his other hand.</p>
<p>It was clear that if he were to be hit by that hand, he would instantly be covered with bruises.</p>
<p>But then Rosetta herself, with her hand on the fan, gradually slowed to a flutter.</p>
<p>Then, it stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>A quiet, dry scoff rang out.</p>
<p>That’s right. She lost. What was on her lips was a smile of defeat.</p>
<p>As if it couldn’t be helped, Rosetta smiled sardonically when she stood on the rooftop.</p>
<p>“Alright. I lost.”</p>
<p>And as she rose to her feet, several pairs of eyes turned towards her.</p>
<p>Among them, Cassion’s gaze was also on her.</p>
<p>He stared at Rosetta, his closed eyes opening wide as he looked at her.</p>
<p>He looked flustered.</p>
<p>Or perhaps vexed.</p>
<p>But who cares?</p>
<p>She couldn’t understand what went on behind Cassion’s gaze.</p>
<p>Rosetta shrugged once and jumped off the roof, towards the ground.</p>
<p>Despite jumping from quite a high place, she landed lightly, just like a cat.</p>
<p>The men were speechless. And so, an inevitable silence stretched before them.</p>
<p>No one expected for her to come down from the roof in that way.</p>
<p>“From now on, I’ll help you.”</p>
<p>Rosetta’s hushed whisper resounded throughout the quiet space beneath the night sky.</p>
<p>“So don’t forget about it this time.”</p>
<p>The smile on her face was incredibly beautiful.</p>
<p>Rosetta waved the fan lightly, hanging precariously by her fingertips.</p>
<p>Then, the fan opened wide with the sound of air being cut.</p>
<p>It was a sound that brought them all back to the present.</p>
<p>“What are ya… How could’ja jump off from there unscathed?”</p>
<p>“She’s human, right? Or… Is she a mage…?”</p>
<p>With the men murmuring amongst themselves, they discussed Rosetta’s identity.</p>
<p>They didn’t seem to remember what golden eyes meant.</p>
<p>This was a good thing for Rosetta.</p>
<p>No, it would be better if it could stay like this forever.</p>
<p>She flapped her fan as though it was a butterfly’s wing, then approached the men.</p>
<p>She walked so gracefully, yet there was no following sound of her footsteps.</p>
<p>In no time, she appeared right under the chin of one man, who didn’t notice it.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The man who belatedly discovered Rosetta made a dumbfounded sound.</p>
<p>And when Rosetta smiled brightly, the man smiled along like a fool.</p>
<p>At that moment—</p>
<p>The man was definitely looking at Rosetta. But when he blinked, he was suddenly staring at a wall.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until he had blinked several times that he realized… the intense pain underneath his chin.</p>
<p>“Aaargh!”</p>
<p>The man rolled to the ground, holding his jaw.</p>
<p>Rosetta had taken a swing at the man’s chin.</p>
<p>‘I knew it. It hurts a little when fighting with a human’s body.’</p>
<p>When she was using this strength in the second round, she was a mix between a transcendent being who had obtained enlightenment and a normal human.</p>
<p>As she expected, there was a huge difference in using this power between a noble young lady’s body and a body that was far more superior than that of a normal human’s.</p>
<p>While Rosetta was immersed with these thoughts, the group of men who saw one man roll on the ground started rushing one by one.</p>
<p>“You think I’ll let this slide?!”</p>
<p>After she folded her fan, Rosetta hit the neck of the person standing in front of her with the same fan.</p>
<p>The man who was properly hit at his vital point collapsed without even screaming.</p>
<p>“…You, what are you?”</p>
<p>“What the… Crazy…”</p>
<p>One time could just be a coincidence, but if the number of times an incident happened reached more than two, it wouldn’t be a coincidence anymore.</p>
<p>Didn’t those two men just go down at a single blow to them each?</p>
<p>The atmosphere quickly got heavy with tension.</p>
<p>Except for Rosetta.</p>
<p>“If I were you, you should have gotten a head start instead of swearing at me.”</p>
<p>Rosetta, who gently closed her eyes, slowly faded from their sight.</p>
<p>This time, the two men who rushed from her front and back suddenly couldn’t see her.</p>
<p>Rosetta waited for the right time, then—swooped down and hit her opponent’s waist in front.</p>
<p>After the man staggered while clutching his side, Rosetta grabbed his neck of that man and pulled him towards the man behind her.</p>
<p>Tak!</p>
<p>‘Huh, so your heads are solid.’</p>
<p>One of them fell to the ground, while the other stumbled.</p>
<p>Rosetta approached the one who stumbled and slammed him into the wall.</p>
<p>Then, she turned to the man who fell to the ground and kicked his head. It wasn’t long until he lost consciousness.</p>
<p>Four of them left.</p>
<p>After that, the succession of events went on similarly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Uuugh…”</p>
<p>Rosetta stood along amidst the middle of groaning men who had collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>She was a little out of breath, but that was all.</p>
<p>As she fanned her face to alleviate the heat rising in her body, she was elegant and picturesque as usual.</p>
<p>“You… Really, what are you.”</p>
<p>The same moment that the violent commotion had settled down, Cassion—the forgotten instigator of the said commotion—leaned back against a wall and spoke.</p>
<p>As he leaned back, it was clear that he was unstable on his feet.</p>
<p>Looking at his shaky legs, it seemed difficult for him just to stand.</p>
<p>‘People would think that you’re the one who fought.’</p>
<p>Rosetta thought this offhandedly, then answered with the same tone.</p>
<p>“I am Rosetta Valentine. Just how many times are you going to make me introduce myself?”</p>
<p>Cassion looked at her as though she had grown two extra heads, but he slipped to the ground with a soft groan.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>The sound of his rough breaths proved that he was at his limit.</p>
<p>His head was going around in circles, and his whole body was so hot that it felt like he was being burned alive.</p>
<p>It was getting difficult for him to ascertain whether the liquid flowing out of his waist was blood or lava.</p>
<p>And it felt like his sight was gradually blurring.</p>
<p>Rosetta observed Cassion for one moment, then approached him with a relaxed stride.</p>
<p>Cassion looked up as he sensed someone above him.</p>
<p>And he saw the sky, where clouds were beginning to subside.</p>
<p>Up until he could see a few weakly glimmering stars above.</p>
<p>His gaze on the sky gradually shifted to Rosetta, who was now right in front of him.</p>
<p>The woman’s shadow swallowed him.</p>
<p>Her cascading hair glistened in the moonlight.</p>
<p>Cassion stared quietly at Rosetta, then laughed heartily.</p>
<p>He could still see how she gracefully moved and beat up all those men.</p>
<p>“If I knew you’d be this strong, haa… I would have asked for your help right away.”</p>
<p>Rosetta narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you saying?”</p>
<p>“I mean it literally.”</p>
<p>“Then… Is that why you didn’t answer me earlier? You’re afraid I’d be weak—that I’ll get hit by these guys?”</p>
<p>“If only one person gets hurt until they’re satisfied, there’s no need to increase the number of victims for no reason.”</p>
<p>It sounded like he was stating the obvious.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s lips, which had risen faintly, gradually drew back into a straight line.</p>
<p>‘He’s this kind of person originally then. Then how did he turn into a villain?’</p>
<p>He ran away because he was suspicious of his surroundings.</p>
<p>He gasped and continued to struggle in a body that was in critical condition.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he didn’t ask for help because the other person would be in danger.</p>
<p>It was laughable, this kindness.</p>
<p>Really. How could such a person be considered a villain?</p>
<p>Rosetta could remember him from the original novel.</p>
<p>An unfortunate villain who tried to use Alicia as revenge against Leo, but he eventually sympathized with Alicia.</p>
<p>A poor man whose life was threatened twice by his family after only attempting—and failing—to strangle Leo’s neck once.</p>
<p>“Is it that? The place with the biggest wound?”</p>
<p>With her fan, Rosetta pointed to Cassion’s side.</p>
<p>His eyelids, which fluttered with difficulty, opened laboriously.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>She stared at Cassion silently, then reached down to pick something up without saying anything in return.</p>
<p>It was a piece of lumber with its end broken off sharply.</p>
<p>Cassion stopped breathing for a moment as he watched the woman’s movements with a blurred gaze.</p>
<p>“Right now… what are you doing.”</p>
<p>With a scratchy voice that seemed to have struggled to get out of his throat, his words trembled.</p>
<p>His hazy vision gradually became clearer.</p>
<p>Inside his head, it felt as though he had been hit with a typhoon.</p>
<p>To the point that even the boiling heat within his body subsided coldly.</p>
<p>“Now—I’m asking you what you’re doing right now.”</p>
<p>Betrayal.</p>
<p>Despite it being irrational, he felt a strange sense of betrayal rising within him.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the night air felt so cold.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of the languid woman’s expression right now.</p>
<p>Or perhaps…</p>
<p>“Is this the place that hurts the most?”</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because the broken end of the jagged wooden plank faced him without him knowing why.</p>
<p>It was a sense of betrayal that he himself couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 24</p>
<p>Their eyes met. Hot and cold.</p>
<p>Red and gold.</p>
<p>Neither of them turned away.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared at him and moved her hand slightly sideways.</p>
<p>As though she was aiming more accurately.</p>
<p>“I gave you time to think, but you ran away. I can’t let you do that again. So choose now—will you follow me, or…”</p>
<p>Her lips stopped.</p>
<p>Inside that room a few hours ago, she had paused like this as well.</p>
<p>She would stop her words from leaving her lips and delay what was to follow.</p>
<p>That’s why he was left imagining what it could possibly be.</p>
<p>What would she say now.</p>
<p>The lips that had been closed tightly opened right then.</p>
<p>Carefully, as though a red flower was secretly blooming from a bud.</p>
<p>“Or will you just die.”</p>
<p>The flower that bloomed was poisonous.</p>
<p>The cold wind blew between them.</p>
<p>Was it because the weather had been unpredictable for a while, or was it because the alley was cold no matter how deep into the summer they were?</p>
<p>“Will you kill me?”</p>
<p>At the straightforward question, Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“I can’t let the person who heard about my plans stay alive. I’m a detail-oriented person. And I’m very careful.”</p>
<p>As she recited this, her gaze never deviated from Cassion’s eyes.</p>
<p>With tension in the air, Rosetta continued speaking as her eyelashes fluttered.</p>
<p>“But I won’t kill you with my own hands.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“If I just return you to the state you were in before and take you back to the cliffside, the person who caused that accident would come and take care of you for me.”</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that was truly plausible considering his family.</p>
<p>If Leo or the Duchess would find out that he was still alive after the scene of the accident had been checked, they would definitely have him be finished off.</p>
<p>This carriage accident was such a good opportunity for them, far superior to when he was pushed down a flight of stairs.</p>
<p>It was clear that the only result of this kind of accident would be ‘death’, unless there was someone who luckily witnessed the accident and gave him a helping hand, or if he returned home on his own.</p>
<p>After thinking this far, Cassion suddenly realized something.</p>
<p>“…But how did you know it wasn’t just an accident?”</p>
<p>The woman claimed to have nothing to do with the Duchess or Leo.</p>
<p>But wasn’t she talking too casually about this, as if she truly knew that there was a ‘criminal’ behind the ‘accident’?</p>
<p>‘How the hell does she know?’</p>
<p>One of Rosetta’s eyebrows visibly rose.</p>
<p>Against her normally calm features, this reaction was quite different.</p>
<p>“Is that important now?”</p>
<p>“It’s very important.”</p>
<p>“Will my answer help you make your decision?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’ll help.”</p>
<p>Rosetta looked into his eyes, seeing his determination, then she looked away.</p>
<p>She sighed inwardly.</p>
<p>‘Sure. I knew this would happen.’</p>
<p>Rosetta murmured to herself in resignation.</p>
<p>She had already guessed that she could be asked this question at least once.</p>
<p>In the first place, if Cassion hadn’t asked her here, she had the intention to talk about it someday in the future.</p>
<p>A seed of doubt would one day bloom into a bigger, lingering suspicion.</p>
<p>Seeds buried in one’s heart would make things go awry.</p>
<p>It would rot and fester, and everything would eventually become suspicious in his eyes.</p>
<p>But when she knew for sure that Cassion was on her side, she would have explained everything then.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s gaze headed back to Cassion.</p>
<p>Even when her gaze wasn’t on him, he continued to stare at her relentlessly.</p>
<p>Seeing his constant doubts on her, she smiled and wondered what she should answer.</p>
<p>Of course, she already had some excuses prepared in advance.</p>
<p>That she heard the carriage’s crash by chance, and when she went to investigate the loud noise, she saw that the horseman was running away.</p>
<p>That, after seeing the guilt on the horseman’s face, she guessed that it wasn’t an accident. And sure enough, she saw his body lying unconscious at the base of the cliff.</p>
<p>That, in fact, as soon as she recognized him, she thought that she should just turn a blind eye. He was another noble and he was part of one of the other three major families of the country. She supposed that it would be troublesome if she got involved in all this.</p>
<p>But she just couldn’t leave him there.</p>
<p>Because he was Cassion.</p>
<p>Because he was the eldest son of the Carter Duchy, the one who couldn’t wield magic.</p>
<p>As an illegitimate child herself, she felt a sense of solidarity with him, knowing the struggle of having other people whispering her back secretly as well.</p>
<p>And… she was lonely.</p>
<p>So she wanted him to live.</p>
<p>Perhaps because she thought he would understand how she felt.</p>
<p>However, she thought that she needed something in return since this was a huge risk for her as well.</p>
<p>That’s why she asked him to grant her ‘wish’, and he replied that he would.</p>
<p>—This was the excuse that Rosetta had prepared in advance, to explain why she noticed that it was not just a simple accident, and to explain why she asked him to grant her wish.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>‘I wonder if I should do that.’</p>
<p>As she faced Cassion now, she didn’t like the idea of giving him these excuses.</p>
<p>In the end, these were all false.</p>
<p>Would she rather make excuses?</p>
<p>Truly?</p>
<p>Did she really need to lie now?</p>
<p>If Cassion would reject her proposition, she was going to abandon him anyway.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t do anything annoying like returning him to his original state, but she’d still throw him back over the cliff.</p>
<p>Dead or alive.</p>
<p>She knew that already.</p>
<p>She didn’t know if this was the obvious choice.</p>
<p>However, it was the best choice for Rosetta.</p>
<p>Cassion was a ‘villain’.</p>
<p>It meant he had a significant role here.</p>
<p>There were no other supporting roles.</p>
<p>Wasn’t he that kind of character?</p>
<p>It was a huge risk for her to change the fate of a character who had a significant role, and for what? She wouldn’t be able to gain what she wanted.</p>
<p>And a butterfly’s wings would eventually cause a storm.</p>
<p>No one would know when that would happen.</p>
<p>If he still refused to be on her side, she had to return things to the original again, or at least to something that resembles the original.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the novel, she couldn’t lose the merit of ‘knowing the future in advance’.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s purpose now was clear: to make Alicia happy.</p>
<p>In order to achieve this goal, even if her methods were cruel, she would do anything in her power.</p>
<p>Rather, the lack of humanity or morality at this point would only help keep her plans going.</p>
<p>If Cassion was abandoned near the scene of the accident now, it would be impossible for him to return home in his current physical condition.</p>
<p>Then, there would be two options left for him to choose.</p>
<p>Die after being discovered by Leo. Or, luckily survive just like in the novel and plot his revenge.</p>
<p>There was also the option to live somewhere else peacefully without exacting revenge, but this was unlikely.</p>
<p>The evidence was when he entered the alleyways.</p>
<p>He stopped every few steps because he was afraid of running into the people that passed by, and he was too overly conscious of his surroundings.</p>
<p>In the end, he even willingly jumped into a dark, dangerous alley on his own because he thought it was deserted.</p>
<p>Foolishly.</p>
<p>How long would he survive like this?</p>
<p>He would jump into a dark path to avoid, to hide, to escape from any visible danger.</p>
<p>He couldn’t live like that for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>And his emotions would build up every time this happened.</p>
<p>Misery. Helplessness.</p>
<p>And these would be amplified by his recent close call with death.</p>
<p>Even if it would be later than the original, Cassion would eventually turn out as the same.</p>
<p>For Cassion in the novel, ‘revenge’ was not just revenge, but it was also him struggling to live like a human being—to survive until the bitter end.</p>
<p>From now on, his mode of survival wouldn’t just be to endure.</p>
<p>Either he dies, or they die. He would have to choose.</p>
<p>And if it would end like the original, unfortunately…</p>
<p>‘He would die sooner or later.’</p>
<p>What reason did she have to hide the truth from a man who would eventually die because he wouldn’t side with her?</p>
<p>Her conflicting thoughts concluded like that.</p>
<p>In a way, this was an impulsive and dangerous choice, but Rosetta wanted to win over this man, even if it meant that she would have to take a risk.</p>
<p>Rather than forcibly pulling a leash to keep him controlled, it might be better to guide him by holding his hand and letting him walk on his own.</p>
<p>“Before…”</p>
<p>Her previously tightly shut lips opened slowly. Cassion’s clouded eyes shone sharply amid the tension.</p>
<p>“Before I tell you, you must keep a promise.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Believe everything I say. Even if it’s unbelievable.”</p>
<p>He didn’t answer right away. His persistent gaze still faced her, but that was all.</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled and shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>It was a provocation towards him for him to answer quicker.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cassion agonized over his choice.</p>
<p>Because he wouldn’t be able to take back what was already said.</p>
<p>If he answered that he wouldn’t believe her, then her lips would close forever. But if he said he would believe her, then he really would have to.</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt a sharp pain at his side. He blocked it with his hands, but his vision blurred as his head spun.</p>
<p>“Limit…”</p>
<p>He was at his limit.</p>
<p>He didn’t have time to think anymore. His eyes would close at this rate.</p>
<p>And once he woke up…</p>
<p>No. He might not even wake up anymore.</p>
<p>The woman, who showed not an ounce of mercy, did not move.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was the kind of person who could turn her back on him without hesitation even now.</p>
<p>Cassion gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>And at that, he gripped the wooden plank that Rosetta was holding.</p>
<p>Haa. With a groan as though his own soul would seep out of his lips, Cassion nodded.</p>
<p>“I’ll believe you.”</p>
<p>He knew that his only real option left was to follow Rosetta, so he replied as such.</p>
<p>Even at this moment when he was on the brink of death once again, he still didn’t want to die by another person’s hand.</p>
<p>Yet if he was going to be by her side, then he would willingly hold her hand.</p>
<p>Rosetta calmly looked at the dying man, then she opened her lips.</p>
<p>“My nanny had abused me and my sister, Alicia, for a long time. One day while she was ‘lecturing’ us, I fainted… And suddenly, I learned something.”</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>“The truth is…”</p>
<p>He could barely hear her staggering words as he blinked his eyes.</p>
<p>Shhwaaa.</p>
<p>Instead of the woman’s voice, what he heard more clearly were the trees that swayed in the wind.</p>
<p>The hand that the woman used to hold the lumber was now in the air, and in turn, the man who held the jagged plank fell helplessly to his side.</p>
<p>Looking at his fingertips, Rosetta continued to talk.</p>
<p>“In the near future, my lovely sister Alicia… I found out that your lunatic younger brother Leo will make her suffer. And…”</p>
<p>The tone she spoke with was cold.</p>
<p>Actually, she spoke faster than usual as though she was in a hurry, but her tone was as dry as before.</p>
<p>This created an eerie feeling.</p>
<p>The nonsense she was spouting almost sounded true.</p>
<p>Even she knew that it was ridiculous, so it couldn’t easily be considered the truth.</p>
<p>“Both you and I. I learned the fact that we will both eventually die. That’s everything I found out.”</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>A smile dawned over someone’s lips.</p>
<p>The two of them.</p>
<p>The speaker and the listener.</p>
<p>Rosetta and Cassion.</p>
<p>Neither knew who it belonged to, this powerless smile.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 25</p>
<p>“Sorry but, I find what you’re saying hard to believe right now. It’s such an absurd story…”</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded after hearing his honest thoughts.</p>
<p>In fact, she also knew that people wouldn’t easily believe this.</p>
<p>It was better that he honestly said that he couldn’t wrap his head around it.</p>
<p>Of course.</p>
<p>‘It’s much better than going with the flow now and hitting me on the back of my head later.’</p>
<p>While Rosetta positively assessed Cassion’s distrust, the man exhaled with a shaky breath.</p>
<p>He covered his lips, but he felt his own scorching breath.</p>
<p>He looked down at his bloody side, then looked up once more to match his gaze with Rosetta.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the time to smile, but he did.</p>
<p>And as he smiled silently, his red eyes suddenly felt heavy.</p>
<p>A hot sensation pressed over his eyes. The heat weighed down his eyes, and eventually became tears that trickled down.</p>
<p>Yet the tears themselves were as cold as ice.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared blankly at Cassion.</p>
<p>One second he said that he couldn’t believe her words, then the next he was suddenly crying.</p>
<p>And he cried coldly, as though he was the winter night himself.</p>
<p>“Hu… ugh…”</p>
<p>What seeped out of his lips were sounds that couldn’t be identified, whether they were sobs or laughter.</p>
<p>Despite that, his lips that were curved up looked sorrowful.</p>
<p>“Why are you crying.”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s not-so-delicate question, Cassion opened his eyes.</p>
<p>More tears streamed down his cheeks as he slowly opened his eyelids.</p>
<p>“Because I’m sad.”</p>
<p>“About what?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s an absurd story, because eventually, it’s making me want to just die.”</p>
<p>An unbelievable explanation. An explanation without any evidence presented.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the connotation of a dog’s death, a meaningless death, hung in the air.</p>
<p>‘Dog’s death.’</p>
<p>Was it because this pitiful, miserable description suited him so well?</p>
<p>Was it because he had always thought that when he was going to die someday, it would be a meaningless death?</p>
<p>“You knew in advance that I would be in an accident, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I saw it in advance, that’s why I was there to save you while you were on the verge of dying. I planned to save you and ask you to join hands with me so that we could escape that fate together.”</p>
<p>But what she didn’t plan was that he would forget about her rescuing him.</p>
<p>Listening to Rosetta’s added explanation, Cassion nodded.</p>
<p>If all those absurd words were true, then the absurd probability could be understood.</p>
<p>He knew now how Rosetta knew about the carriage ‘accident’.</p>
<p>So when she saved him…</p>
<p>And when she suddenly told him to become the next duke instead of Leo…</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do now?”</p>
<p>Rosetta asked Cassion with a hushed voice. He was lost in thought.</p>
<p>“I said everything I could say. But if you’re still thinking about it…”</p>
<p>She stopped talking for a while, then she raised her hand and uncurled her fingers one by one.</p>
<p>Index finger, middle finger, and ring finger.</p>
<p>As she held up three fingers, a solemn voice came out from Rosetta’s lips.</p>
<p>“One, I will do my best to help you, Cassion Carter, while you’re on my side, and I will never abandon you. Two, I will make sure that you can survive and become happy at the end of it all. And three, if I ever break this oath, I vow that I shall die the cruelest, most miserable death in the world, and that I will remove myself from everyone’s memories.”</p>
<p>This vicious oath resounded throughout the dark alley.</p>
<p>And as she stopped speaking, she slowly turned her eyes towards the man.</p>
<p>“What a brutal vow.”</p>
<p>“It’s supposed to be like that if you want it to be upheld. Even if it’s uncomfortable to hear.”</p>
<p>At the man’s words which were tinted with amusement, Rosetta also replied with a similar tone of voice.</p>
<p>The fingers she had folded as she counted were held up again.</p>
<p>“Now, it’s your turn to choose.”</p>
<p>She had already laid everything she could in front of him. All that was left was Cassion’s choice.</p>
<p>“Will you die as fate decrees, or…”</p>
<p>Survive. With her.</p>
<p>Rosetta reached out to the man. It was the same hand that had been wounded by glass shards, still bandaged now—the same hand that held up three fingers to signify her vow.</p>
<p>The white bandage was stained with both blood and rubble.</p>
<p>The blood of the man she saved, the rubble that she grazed to save him.</p>
<p>Cassion stared at Rosetta’s hand. Then, his gasping voice rang clearly.</p>
<p>“I trust you…”</p>
<p>Soon after, he stopped leaning back on the wall.</p>
<p>But his head, as it lost the place where it leaned on, faltered dangerously forward.</p>
<p>Like a flower swaying in the wind.</p>
<p>“Since I said I’ll trust you… Even if it’s unbelievable, I’ll trust you. So after all this, if what you say is true…”</p>
<p>Rosetta stared wordlessly as his black hair fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>“Heuk…”</p>
<p>With a groan, his shoulders shook and sank down.</p>
<p>But even before he crouched down, a series of biting coughs came out of his mouth.</p>
<p>And red blood flowed down the corner of his lips and wet his chin.</p>
<p>He steeled his gaze.</p>
<p>He was already losing consciousness.</p>
<p>Now, he couldn’t even feel the pain anymore.</p>
<p>Cassion squeezed out his last remaining strength and lifted his head slightly.</p>
<p>But his gaze lost its grip as his staggering body barely reached Roseta.</p>
<p>“I accept your proposition.”</p>
<p>His quivering red eyes flashed with madness.</p>
<p>“Rosetta Valentine. I don’t know how you’re going to make me the next Duke, but… Alright… Save me. Make me the next Duke.”</p>
<p>Please.</p>
<p>The face that was wet with both blood and tears smiled broadly.</p>
<p>And he leaned down towards the hand that reached out towards him, his cheek on her palm.</p>
<p>He couldn’t move his hands because he was using them to prop himself up, holding onto the wall behind him.</p>
<p>That’s right. This was his best option.</p>
<p>Her palm was wet.</p>
<p>Not knowing whether it was blood or tears, Rosetta continued to stay silent.</p>
<p>Soon, however, she could feel the face in her palm move slowly.</p>
<p>Even this stiff expression trembled.</p>
<p>“Even so, if I still die no matter what… I just want to continue enduring.”</p>
<p>Anger. Sadness. Misery. Despair.</p>
<p>And hope.</p>
<p>His voice was tinged with several different emotions.</p>
<p>“Save me.”</p>
<p>Where desperate words and confessions were laid bare, the air was now filled with silence.</p>
<p>Devoid of either his breath or the beating of his heart.</p>
<p>“…Cassion?”</p>
<p>Rosetta called out to him, a heavy foreboding weighing on her shoulders.</p>
<p>She couldn’t feel any movement on her palm.</p>
<p>She couldn’t feel even his staggered breaths.</p>
<p>As her hand grew cold over his skin, the novel’s contents flashed through mind.</p>
<p>「 He collapsed to the ground underneath the red, burning sunset, but when he hurriedly opened his eyes, the cold evening air hit his body.</p>
<p>He could see the night sky, where clouds peacefully floated by. The moon, which was covered by the clouds, slowly revealed itself.</p>
<p>His body temperature rapidly dropped as his clothes were soaked with his own blood.</p>
<p>The darkness that quickly followed the dangerous night made his throat clench.</p>
<p>“Urgh…”</p>
<p>With a pained groan, his bright red eyes finally lost their light. His breath stopped and no longer passed through his throat.</p>
<p>Like a blank sheet, his cold body lay motionless.</p>
<p>And thus, Cassion’s heart stopped. 」</p>
<p>‘No way.’</p>
<p>As Rosetta recalled the original scene, she urgently collapsed in front of him.</p>
<p>The cold body slid down as she moved.</p>
<p>“Cassion! Cassion!”</p>
<p>The man’s eyes wouldn’t open even as she called him desperately.</p>
<p>His face grew paler and paler.</p>
<p>‘No. This is fine.’</p>
<p>It turned out great.</p>
<p>Yes. His heart simply stopped here.</p>
<p>Although the time and location changed a little, it was still the same day of the accident.</p>
<p>Around this time, the heart of Cassion in the novel had also stopped beating, so in a little while, his heart should also start back up again.</p>
<p>Just like the original.</p>
<p>From the start, a mage’s source of mana was their heart.</p>
<p>They used the mana that flowed through their heart to conjure magic, and a mage’s ability was determined by their mana affinity and prowess with mana application.</p>
<p>Therefore, a mage needed both effort and natural talent.</p>
<p>Since the condition was to have both mana that flowed through one’s body and the ability to control this through mana application, if one or the other couldn’t be achieved, then the result would arrive at zero. If one wasn’t born with mana affinity, then they wouldn’t be able to become a mage.</p>
<p>But here, Cassion couldn’t comply with the requirement of ‘mana application’.</p>
<p>There was mana in his body, but he couldn’t use it because it didn’t flow well through him.</p>
<p>Because he wasn’t born with the natural talent to control this, he couldn’t become a mage.</p>
<p>But this was half right and half wrong.</p>
<p>It was true that Cassion’s mana was trapped in his heart.</p>
<p>It was also true that his mana couldn’t flow through his bloodstream because there was something blocking the pathways.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t true that he lacked the ability to control his mana.</p>
<p>‘The fact is that his mana has just been blocked.’</p>
<p>That’s the only thing.</p>
<p>With regard to mana application and mana affinity, he was the purest sense of ‘natural talent’.</p>
<p>He was a genius that was born only once in a thousand years.</p>
<p>With his mana blocked, no one noticed his talents.</p>
<p>No matter how much of a genius he was, if he was never given a chance to explore his talents, then he wouldn’t be able to live up to his potential.</p>
<p>Just as when one wouldn’t know if they could kick well until they actually kicked a ball.</p>
<p>Cassion had never been given a ball, let alone a chance to kick one.</p>
<p>And in the original work, when his heart stopped, this served as a trigger for him to be able to receive that ‘ball’.</p>
<p>What gave him the power to become a villain was this revival.</p>
<p>His heart had now cooled and stopped moving.</p>
<p>Rosetta once again recalled the original text.</p>
<p>「 It hadn’t been long since Cassion’s heart stopped.</p>
<p>Mana began to flow through it instead of blood, trickling in endlessly.</p>
<p>It was something of a ‘defense mechanism’.</p>
<p>In order to save the dying body, the heart began to supply the mana trapped within it instead of blood.</p>
<p>It was a miracle.</p>
<p>A marvelous phenomenon that his mana was flowing.</p>
<p>Truthfully, this alone was not enough to save his dying body.</p>
<p>The amount of mana that began to seep was like only a thin stream of water.</p>
<p>However, as a result, Cassion’s heart began to beat once more.</p>
<p>His ‘mana application’—that he or anyone else never knew about—was on the level of a genius.</p>
<p>As the shallow mana began to trickle, his overwhelming talent began to flood.</p>
<p>His body became warm again. And he could breathe once more.</p>
<p>His stiffened fingers were spread out, and his leaking blood slowly stopped.</p>
<p>And finally.</p>
<p>His heart, which had stopped beating, began to pound loudly.</p>
<p>Boom, boom, boom.</p>
<p>“Heuuk.”</p>
<p>The breath he took in was ragged and pained, just like the one he breathed out as he died just moments ago.</p>
<p>Cassion opened his eyes.</p>
<p>The world was still dark, yet the stars blanketing the night sky glimmered fiercely.</p>
<p>He could tell without ascertaining it.</p>
<p>This strange sensation that now flowed through his body.</p>
<p>After being abandoned by everyone—after being abandoned by the world—he finally became a Carter who could wield magic. 」</p>
<p>That’s right. According to the novel, he should soon open his eyes and realize his own abilities.</p>
<p>Although the mana flowing through his streams was unstable, he would become a formidable mage because of his remarkable mana application…</p>
<p>She was confident that this would be solved.</p>
<p>So, Cassion just needed to open his eyes…</p>
<p>“You can open your eyes now.”</p>
<p>Rosetta bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 26</p>
<p>Because of how hard she bit down on her lower lip, blood profusely seeped out of the wound.</p>
<p>Feeling nervous like this wasn’t like her, but it was because of this ‘uncertainty.’</p>
<p>It was ironic, but she wasn’t sure if Cassion would open his eyes.</p>
<p>Since the time she brought him in, Cassion’s part in the novel had already been altered.</p>
<p>Because of this, all the parts related to ‘Cassion’ in the novel would be nothing short of uncertain prophecy.</p>
<p>When it came to simple plotlines, even if it was an uncertain prophecy, she thought that it would be fine even if she helped him, but…</p>
<p>This… this was a matter of life.</p>
<p>What if he wouldn’t open his eyes just like in the novel and instead he would take his last breath here?</p>
<p>Save me.’</p>
<p>The hushed voice that fell short as tears fell over a brilliant smile. The desperate voice seemed to overlap with the face of the man even as his eyes were closed.</p>
<p>It was a short-lived hallucination to appease her worries.</p>
<p>Rosetta carefully laid Cassion’s body on the floor.</p>
<p>‘Alright. Even if your mana doesn’t flow this time… Let’s just try to save you and think about that again later.’</p>
<p>Once he came back to life, there would be a way.</p>
<p>The fact that mana was trapped in his heart and the fact that Cassion had enormous mana application—these remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were many ways to make him a ‘mage’ even if there were a couple of setbacks.</p>
<p>She pressed over the smooth, pale bridge of his nose and lifted the man’s chin.</p>
<p>The slightly open lips had already lost their color, but the teeth inside the mouth were white and the tongue was too red.</p>
<p>“Haa.”</p>
<p>‘I can’t believe I’ll be using the CPR lessons I had back in middle school in this kind of place.’</p>
<p>Rosetta, who breathed in, slowly leaned over the man’s face.</p>
<p>The distance between them grew closer. The cold temperature of a body with a halted heart could be felt near her face.</p>
<p>Rosetta paused for a while, but continued leaning down once more.</p>
<p>Finally, their open lips locked.</p>
<p>It was her first time to breathe life into someone, so I felt strange.</p>
<p>Therefore, Rosetta did not know. Right after her lips touched.</p>
<p>The fact that the man’s heart has already begun to beat again.</p>
<p>And at that moment, his eyelashes that had been tightly closed, fluttered open for a moment. At which, the red eyes briefly showed awareness, but then faded into unconsciousness once more.</p>
<p>Warmth slowly returned to the cooled lips.</p>
<p>Those warm lips were both lukewarm, yet scorching.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Deep into the night, inside a room where Cassion was also staying in.</p>
<p>“If I hadn’t found you then, what would you have done? I know that a lot of suspicious people come to our hotel, but… It’s not easy to come in with someone bleeding so much like that.”</p>
<p>Placing Cassion back on the bed, Rosetta turned towards the sound of laughter that she heard from the other side of the room.</p>
<p>A woman leaning against an empty table, hiding her face under a blue veil, waved her hand toward Rosetta.</p>
<p>And they made eye contact.</p>
<p>Smiling lightly, Rosetta while correcting Cassion’s posture.</p>
<p>“I’m aware. It would have been a disaster if you hadn’t found us. It’s fortunate that you appeared as soon as I got near the hotel as if you had been surveilling us.”</p>
<p>“It’s really just a coincidence. There must really be such a thing like fate in the world. For example, the Princess and I are on the same page.”</p>
<p>The voice that responded was very shameless.</p>
<p>The gesture of the woman touching her chest as if she had nothing to hide was also exaggerated.</p>
<p>Rosetta was at a loss for words as she shook her head.</p>
<p>Right. Whether someone would throw a rope to a person who’s drowning, or should it be something as useless as underwear or a rubber band, it was up to the rescuer.</p>
<p>Anyway, wasn’t the important thing here the fact that she was ‘saved’?</p>
<p>It’s true that Blanca’s sudden appearance seemed very coincidental, but as a result, Rosetta was able to receive her help.</p>
<p>So she chose not to say anything more.</p>
<p>A few moments ago.</p>
<p>While Cassion was unconscious, she gave him CPR.</p>
<p>While breathing life into him, Rosetta realized at some point that his pulse had returned.</p>
<p>When she touched his pale face, she felt a weak sense of warmth beneath her touch even though his body was still as cold as a corpse’s.</p>
<p>“You’re alive.”</p>
<p>After a short sigh of relief, Rosetta picked him up and headed back to the hotel.</p>
<p>She also didn’t forget to fasten his cloak tightly so that his face and wounds wouldn’t be seen.</p>
<p>Although his unnecessarily long legs kept getting tangled, they were able to arrive at the hotel shortly after.</p>
<p>The question was how they would go in.</p>
<p>If they’re going in with their cloaks on, no matter who saw it, it was suspicious…</p>
<p>‘It would be suspicious for a man and a woman to enter the main doors like this so openly.’</p>
<p>And apart from that, since she was carrying the clearly collapsed man over her back like this, it was all the more suspicious.</p>
<p>Employees with lids over their mouths would pretend not to see it, but customers with curious eyes and flapping lips would blow this out of proportion.</p>
<p>Those who had a lot of money had rather cheap hobbies.</p>
<p>While she was mulling over where to hide Cassion while she would go in to ask help from an employee, someone approached her.</p>
<p>”Princess.”</p>
<p>A familiar whisper called to her.</p>
<p>She blinked and turned around, towards the direction of the voice.</p>
<p>However, she could see not even an anthill from where she was standing against the hotel’s outer wall.</p>
<p>She could feel a weak presence, but that was all.</p>
<p>”Blanca?”</p>
<p>Rosetta called the name in a small voice, but there was still no one who appeared in front of her.</p>
<p>‘Am I being haunted by a ghost?’</p>
<p>Suddenly? A ghost?</p>
<p>The corners of her lips tugged up at the ridiculous thought.</p>
<p>It was so funny even to Rosetta.</p>
<p>But then at that moment—</p>
<p>One part of the hotel’s outer wall began to open.</p>
<p>‘What is it this time.’</p>
<p>It was obviously a hidden door that would lead to a secret space.</p>
<p>And there was only one person who’d install something like that in the hotel.</p>
<p>The owner of the hotel herself.</p>
<p>Madam Blanca.</p>
<p>As expected, it was Madam Blanca who appeared through the door.</p>
<p>The owner of the hotel continued to cover her face with a blue veil.</p>
<p>”Over here, Princess.”</p>
<p>Blanca beckoned Rosetta with one hand as she held the door open, the gesture expressing something like Blanca’s secretive yet playful attitude.</p>
<p>Rosetta thought for a while about what she should do, but she didn’t need long.</p>
<p>It was a little dubious how the secret door opened here the moment she worried about how to enter the hotel, but there was no reason not to follow the owner.</p>
<p>Anyway, with Blanca’s help, Rosetta and Cassion arrived at her room on the fifth floor of the hotel.</p>
<p>They entered the fifth floor from behind the painting in the room, just as Blanca did earlier.</p>
<p>While thinking about the countless doors that she saw while walking behind Blanca, including this room, Rosetta thought…</p>
<p>‘Indeed, privacy in this hotel… is this really okay?’</p>
<p>She couldn’t help but think this, but since she received help in this way, she couldn’t condemn Blanca for it.</p>
<p>“You really didn’t follow me, right?”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Rosetta had to ask because she felt uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Blanca listened to the question silently, then shook her head.</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s just that I noticed how two people in cloaks left… and I wondered when they would come back. And then, I checked through the window and saw you there.”</p>
<p>Just in case, if some complications occurred, what Blanca was saying was that she might have picked them up.</p>
<p>Her tone was still playful, but it didn’t seem like she was lying.</p>
<p>‘Certainly, I didn’t feel anyone on my trail while I was following Cassion. Maybe?’</p>
<p>In any case, Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“I’m touched that you trust me. I knew it. Could this perhaps be because we’re meant to be?”</p>
<p>“What nonsense are you…”</p>
<p>“Anyway.”</p>
<p>Blanca, who lightly covered Rosetta’s lips, slid down from her perch on the table.</p>
<p>“He doesn’t look so good… Should I call for the doctor again?”</p>
<p>At Blanca’s words, she turned and looked towards Cassion.</p>
<p>His sleeping face was peaceful.</p>
<p>Anyway, he was a man who looked innocent while he slept.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Then, let me know when you want me to call one. I’ll call the doctor anytime. As you know, he has a very heavy tongue.”</p>
<p>“Alright, thank you. But before that, I have more things I want to request from you.”</p>
<p>“Pardon? Again?”</p>
<p>Blanca asked about Rosetta’s request earlier.</p>
<p>Those were still under progress. Less than half a day has passed since that request was made.</p>
<p>However, what can she do?</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, ‘Madam Blanca’ is the most important character who made Cassion the Duke.</p>
<p>“Yes. Anyway, isn’t this hotel good? I have a lot of requests.”</p>
<p>If Rosetta were to turn it around here, then it was her who needed Blanca’s help now.</p>
<p>The woman, who was silent for a while, suddenly burst into a peal of laughter.</p>
<p>“You’re really interesting. Do you know? If someone makes more than three requests, we call them a ‘regular’. Lady Rosetta is a client who’s become a regular customer in the shortest time.”</p>
<p>“Really? Then, shall we do something more shocking?”</p>
<p>“Is it more shocking than before? No, just how much are you going to surprise me?”</p>
<p>Unlike her words, her voice was filled with anticipation.</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced at her and took a slow step towards the table where Blanca was sitting.</p>
<p>When she pulled out an empty chair, Blanca naturally sat opposite Rosetta.</p>
<p>“So you’re quite serious?”</p>
<p>“I’d like to get things started in earnest. That’s why I came to this hotel. I thought you’d listen to my requests sincerely.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for the compliment. So, what is this shocking request?”</p>
<p>At a faint urge, Rosetta tapped the table with her fingertips.</p>
<p>The steady staccato broke through the silence.</p>
<p>With the shallow taps as a background music, Rosetta organized her thoughts, whether it would be alright to say what should be said in the future.</p>
<p>Words that are spilled out once couldn’t be picked back up again.</p>
<p>After a brief thought, she slowly opened her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“I’ll try to make you happy all my life.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“You won’t need to look for anything interesting going on anymore. I’ll make it fun for you.”</p>
<p>“Are you perhaps proposing to me? That’s what it sounds like.”</p>
<p>Rosetta rolled her eyes at Blanca’s secretive tone.</p>
<p>But as she listened to it, the nuance was clear.</p>
<p>“I know, right. I should have bought a ring. Unfortunately, I’ll have to give it to you next time. I just need to buy a big diamond and put it in your fourth finger, hm?”</p>
<p>Blanca held up the back of her left hand, then she nodded.</p>
<p>Beyond the mesh lace gloves, a ring on her fourth finger caught Rosetta’s eye.</p>
<p>It was a ring with a purple gem on it.</p>
<p>“That’s a very tempting offer, but unfortunately, there’s already someone who occupied the fourth finger.”</p>
<p>“You’re married?”</p>
<p>Rosetta was genuinely surprised.</p>
<p>In the novel, Blanca being married was never mentioned.</p>
<p>In fact, the only information about her was that she was an amazing guild owner, and that she had a penchant for ‘interesting things’.</p>
<p>Still, given her free-spirited nature and profession, Rosetta thought that she would have been single…</p>
<p>Blanca quietly rubbed her left ring finger, exactly where the ring was.</p>
<p>After that gentle touch, a calm voice that didn’t match her demeanor came out of her lips.</p>
<p>“I used to be. It ended when the other person died.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 27</p>
<p>It was very difficult to respond.</p>
<p>“Goodness.”</p>
<p>When Rosetta replied in this way, her tone tinged with a hint of regret, Blanca clenched a fist in the air, then hid her hand once more.</p>
<p>“Well, that’s enough about that. We didn’t even love each other in the first place.”</p>
<p>Considering the way she spoke about her dead husband, she spoke in a very unfriendly manner.</p>
<p>However, it was impossible to judge how their relationship was because of how affectionately she touched the ring earlier.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what you were about to mention earlier, Princess… I’m curious about that. My, well you even hastily made a grand proposal.”</p>
<p>As she had conducted herself calmly before, a polite voice spoke to Rosetta.</p>
<p>There was still curiosity there, but that was it.</p>
<p>If she wanted to stop negotiating, she wouldn’t have asked again.</p>
<p>For a moment, Rosetta glanced at Blanca’s hand for some reason, then she opened her lips to speak as she eyed Blanca’s veil.</p>
<p>“Madam Blanca. I hope you say only the truth. Do you know who this man is?”</p>
<p>At the serious question, Blanca thought about it for a moment.</p>
<p>“Only by chance. I already knew his face, so I recognized him at a glance.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then it’ll be easier for me to explain.”</p>
<p>Rosetta paused, then spoke again.</p>
<p>“I’m going to make this man a Duke.”</p>
<p>“Oh my.”</p>
<p>“So, I need your help on this. That is my request.”</p>
<p>Blanca was speechless, but she was covering her lips gleefully.</p>
<p>“You’ll drive the other son out… and make the eldest son the Duke?”</p>
<p>Blanca spoke to herself as though I couldn’t hear.</p>
<p>Then, as she leaned back on her chair, Rosetta felt the other woman’s reluctance.</p>
<p>“For one request… There’ll be a lot to do.”</p>
<p>She was a quick-witted merchant.</p>
<p>She would definitely be at a loss if she took on a request as big as this.</p>
<p>If she were to list down the requests that Rosetta had made…</p>
<p>A magic tool to change one’s appearance and an investigation on someone—these were both requests needed to make Cassion a Duke.</p>
<p>“Right. Of course, I’ll compensate you for everything.”</p>
<p>Fortunately, there was no shortage of financial resources.</p>
<p>Although she was an illegitimate child, Rosetta was treated like a ducal princess just like Alicia, except for the fact that her family was uncomfortable around her.</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, pocket money, anything else.</p>
<p>And what kind of allowance did a princess have in a wealthy Duchy such as theirs?</p>
<p>There wasn’t even any need to go to a safe to get the money needed. Jewelry boxes filled her dresser drawers.</p>
<p>She could even buy a few houses in the capital with those.</p>
<p>“Even if I look like this, I have some money.”</p>
<p>“…So you say, but you already look like you have a lot of money.”</p>
<p>With a disbelieving tone, Blanca gestured towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>“If you understand, then that’s fine. Anyway, as you know, I’ll need a lot of help to make that man a Duke.”</p>
<p>Rosetta paused.</p>
<p>If there was a teacup in front of her, she would have taken a sip. Then, she shifted her gaze towards the sleeping Cassion.</p>
<p>Even without looking at him, she knew that he would have a calm expression.</p>
<p>Rosetta was doing so much right now, but for whom was it for?</p>
<p>Of course, ‘Alicia’ was the fundamental reason.</p>
<p>She averted her eyes once more, recalling Alicia’s bright smile.</p>
<p>Then, as she looked at the woman wearing a veil, she opened her lips.</p>
<p>“Under the request to ‘make that man a Duke’, I would like to put together a list of smaller requests. To be honest, I’m just doing it this way because it would be annoying to request them one by one. I might need to contact you for a request in the future, and it would be tiring for me to come back here every time. And, the necessary requests I’ll ask of you at that time… I think you know what to expect.”</p>
<p>“In short, to make him a Duke, you want to borrow ‘me’ myself, is that it?”</p>
<p>“If you put it that way, then it would be like I’m tying you down. How about this—why don’t we work together towards one goal? I just want your helping hand. I don’t care if you continue taking requests from other people.”</p>
<p>The veil moved subtly.</p>
<p>Judging by how her shoulders were shaking, it was a silent laugh.</p>
<p>Then, she straightened her previously lax posture. She slowly turned towards Cassion.</p>
<p>“First, you have to tell me who that person is.”</p>
<p>“You’ve already figured out who he is.”</p>
<p>“If you don’t tell me directly, it’s in my code to continue to pretend not to know.”</p>
<p>It was a code she abided by because she valued clients’ secrets.</p>
<p>“Cassion Carter, the heir to the Carter family who can’t wield magic.”</p>
<p>“Aha.”</p>
<p>It was a soulless exclamation.</p>
<p>Staring at Cassion for a while, Blanca sat up straight.</p>
<p>“The price will be expensive. Will you still ask me to do it?”</p>
<p>“Can I pay the down payment first, then give you the rest later?”</p>
<p>“Why? You said you have more money than I think.”</p>
<p>“I have it, of course, but I don’t think it’s to the degree of abundance that you think. If you succeed later…”</p>
<p>Rosetta raised a finger and pointed towards Cassion.</p>
<p>“You can take more money from him, you know.”</p>
<p>Then, Rosetta cut through the air with the same finger, then pulled it back.</p>
<p>Blanca had no response.</p>
<p>Perhaps the way Rosetta looked as she leisurely sat was suspicious.</p>
<p>Silence filled the room.</p>
<p>Other than the sound of breathing from time to time, there was absolutely no sound.</p>
<p>How long did it stay that way? Soon, the sound of a surface being hit rang across the air.</p>
<p>In the same way that a sudden light in the midst of darkness would be blinking, the sound emitted during this prolonged silence was far too loud.</p>
<p>And the sound came from Blanca’s hand.</p>
<p>Her hand, which was on the glass table, tapped on the surface in a gradually increasing tempo.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked towards the veiled face, wondering if this was Blanca’s way of expressing her rejection, but Blanca leaned back on her seat just then.</p>
<p>“Ahahaha!”</p>
<p>And a burst of loud, boisterous laughter echoed in the air.</p>
<p>It was such a sudden outburst that Rosetta had to wonder where it was coming from.</p>
<p>Just as Blanca had tapped the table for a long time, she gradually stopped laughing only when her throat grew weary of her unruly peal of laughter.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>It seemed to be quite difficult for her to regain her breath. She kept saying, ‘Ha… p… pfft…’ while covering her face with a hand.</p>
<p>Only after she stopped laughing that the situation was placed back in order.</p>
<p>“Ah… Ha. I apologize deeply.”</p>
<p>With her hands still on her sides, she spoke in a breathless voice.</p>
<p>It was a long time before those words spilled out of her lips, and she sounded all the more amused.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. If you laugh, fortune will come to you. You’ll be more blessed.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I think what you promised is already here. I feel like I’ll be living every day in laughter from now on. How long has it been since I felt this way?”</p>
<p>As Blanca said this, she tapped on her chair’s armrest in a calm manner.</p>
<p>Ta, da, da, da, dak.</p>
<p>The sound of her five fingers tapping on the armrest was rhythmic.</p>
<p>“So, did you find an answer after you’ve laughed?”</p>
<p>“…First of all, it’s true that it’s unconventional and unimaginable. At the same time, it’s unprecedented yet plausible. So… I wonder how it would be possible to do this.”</p>
<p>A merchant’s tongue was very heavy.</p>
<p>With one final tap, a strange tension hovered in the air.</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>When asked briefly, Blanca leaned forward.</p>
<p>She was so close that Rosetta thought that she might be able to see her features through the veil.</p>
<p>“Then first, I’ll treat this as a couple of requests from a regular customer. Collaboration—we’ll decide that later.”</p>
<p>Rosetta didn’t know if she saw it wrong or not, but she thought she might have seen red lips drawing a line beneath the veil.</p>
<p>“This feels like a test,” Rosetta said.</p>
<p>“Not at all. You don’t like this arrangement?”</p>
<p>“Did I say that? I’m pretty good at taking exams, you know.”</p>
<p>“Ah, more than you look again.”</p>
<p>Blanca chuckled, then she spoke in a hush once more.</p>
<p>“Then let me know if you have another request. Your goal is ambitious, so let’s leave it at that for now.”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll leave after seeing your face.”</p>
<p>“Oh? So you have another request.”</p>
<p>Rosetta just shrugged at Blanca’s unenthused exclamation.</p>
<p>Even she knew that it was a lot for a request.</p>
<p>“This man needs a new status. And that person I mentioned before, the one I asked you to investigate.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that person is already under observation by our competent staff.”</p>
<p>There was one person that came to Rosetta’s mind when Blanca mentioned ‘competent staff’.</p>
<p>In the novel, the man who stood by her was entirely loyal and dedicated.</p>
<p>‘Was it Logan?’</p>
<p>She couldn’t remember the name well, but maybe it sounded similar.</p>
<p>In any case, even if she couldn’t remember the name, Rosetta knew that the employee Blanca mentioned was someone reliable.</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded and continued speaking.</p>
<p>“Anyway, Cassion and that person. They both need fake titles. Definitely enough for them to get jobs at my family’s estate.”</p>
<p>“In short, you’re asking me to make new identities for them so that they can enter your family’s estate, correct?”</p>
<p>“Can you do it?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Blanca showed the back of her right hand.</p>
<p>Then, she flapped her ring finger.</p>
<p>She fluttered her finger in the air as though it was a butterfly’s wing.</p>
<p>“I’ll take you up on your offer of diamonds. Fortunately, my ring finger on my right hand is empty.”</p>
<p>Meaning, it was an obvious acceptance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It felt like a storm had passed by and left.</p>
<p>Her body drooped against the chair’s backrest, but as she remembered the fact that she forgot to check Cassion’s condition, she rose from her seat.</p>
<p>She was overcome with drowsiness.</p>
<p>She couldn’t sleep well for a few nights, so this was inevitable.</p>
<p>After coming to this world, she always somehow lacked sleep.</p>
<p>‘Ah, it’s the same in that place as well, this lack of sleep.’</p>
<p>Because of her chaotic surroundings, she only now recalled the memories she almost forgot.</p>
<p>It was like a silent reminder, a hushed scolding of ‘how dare you forget yourself’.</p>
<p>After pressing down on her throbbing head, she sat down by the bed where Cassion was laying.</p>
<p>“I want to lie down and sleep, too.”</p>
<p>She was so tired that she started talking to herself, and at this, she laughed.</p>
<p>‘Ah, first aid kit.’</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, she forgot to ask Blanca to prepare a first aid kit.</p>
<p>‘Should I call again?’</p>
<p>She did, and the staff came to give her a first aid kit.</p>
<p>Oh, she felt terribly lazy just thinking about it.</p>
<p>As she looked over to the clock, it was already 2:05 AM.</p>
<p>She laid back on the bed as though she had also collapsed herself.</p>
<p>Even when Cassion was already laying on the bed, there was still a lot of space left for a second person to lay down there.</p>
<p>Her heavy eyelids blinked.</p>
<p>So many things happened today.</p>
<p>She used her strength which wasn’t stable yet, and she could already feel the effects that had on her weak body.</p>
<p>Her senses gradually welcomed the abyss.</p>
<p>‘I can’t do this though…’</p>
<p>She had dug through her distant memories and even did CPR.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it so unfair though that the man she barely saved would get hurt again and get in trouble?</p>
<p>And her blinking eyes barely settled down.</p>
<p>She might have dozed off for a while because the clock’s second hand was now at 15 minutes.</p>
<p>‘I need to pull myself together. Just treat him. Then I’ll sleep, too.’</p>
<p>She propped her arm on the bed and raised her tired body.</p>
<p>But as soon as she rose, something slipped down.</p>
<p>It was a blanket.</p>
<p>‘Did I sleep under the blanket?’</p>
<p>No way. She fell asleep without realizing it, so it wasn’t possible that she slept under one.</p>
<p>As she looked at the blanket in confusion, she slowly turned her head and looked at Cassion.</p>
<p>Though he looked unusually stiff, his eyes were closed peacefully.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 28</p>
<p>‘There’s no serenity.’</p>
<p>It hadn’t even been a day since she met Cassion, but she could see that this was strange enough for him.</p>
<p>This man, when he slept, always looked strangely serene.</p>
<p>She looked alternately between the blanket in her hand and the man, then she quietly sat up.</p>
<p>Then, she looked squarely at Cassion.</p>
<p>“Cassion.”</p>
<p>She called out to him in a small voice, but there was no response. Even so, there were some small wrinkles beside the eyelids of his closed eyes.</p>
<p>‘No matter how you look at it…’</p>
<p>It looked like he was awake.</p>
<p>The blanket couldn’t have flown over her body on its own, so someone must have covered her with it.</p>
<p>And there’s only this guy in the same room. But he was desperately closing his eyes like this…</p>
<p>Should she point out that she noticed he’s awake or not?</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes as she looked at him, and she soon reached out to the bedside table.</p>
<p>When she opened the second drawer, there were various first aid supplies there.</p>
<p>‘Ah, there really is something there already.’</p>
<p>Now that she thought about it, she didn’t think they would have left after just treating Cassion.</p>
<p>It was a room with a patient in it.</p>
<p>It was also a five-story room with important guests residing there, so they must have a few first aid supplies on hand.</p>
<p>She was very relieved that she wouldn’t need to bother with calling someone for it.</p>
<p>After roughly rummaging through its contents, she brought out clean bandages, cotton cloths, disinfectants and a topical cream to treat wounds. Right after, the drawer was closed.</p>
<p>Tak.</p>
<p>It closed with a loud sound, but Cassion still wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>‘At this point, are you really sleeping? How can someone always sleep so well?’</p>
<p>And the blanket… somehow flew on her on its own. Sure.</p>
<p>With that ridiculous thought in mind, Rosetta took the bandages first.</p>
<p>After confirming that this would be the right length for his wound, she removed the blanket covering the man.</p>
<p>And when she did, the sheet was dyed red.</p>
<p>The blood didn’t seep through, but his clothes seemed to have been heavily stained.</p>
<p>‘I would still have to call someone in the end.’</p>
<p>She couldn’t avoid troublesome things.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why it’s annoying to her.</p>
<p>With a short sigh, she reached out.</p>
<p>Towards the man’s waist.</p>
<p>His clothes were so thoroughly soaked that blood even dripped.</p>
<p>Carefully holding one end of the shirt, she pulled it upward gingerly.</p>
<p>Below where the shirt was lifted, the apricot colored bare skin wrapped with red bandages appeared.</p>
<p>‘More than I thought…’</p>
<p>His body looked good.</p>
<p>No wonder he held up longer when she hadn’t stepped in.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was thanks to repeated exercise and training, even while he was locked up in his room.</p>
<p>A few years ago, Cassion locked himself in his room amid the repeated threats to his life.</p>
<p>His anxiety reached his limit, and he had only one thought.</p>
<p>That even when cornered, he should at least be able to rely on himself.</p>
<p>He had to do something to protect himself.</p>
<p>He couldn’t use magic, so he turned to physical training.</p>
<p>Since his room was small, this was the best he could do inside.</p>
<p>Thus, he chose to train himself from the books he had read. He eventually learned swordsmanship even without fundamental skills.</p>
<p>Truthfully, his plan wasn’t very fruitful.</p>
<p>Aristocrats usually refrained from this method, but he basically learned everything on his own through books.</p>
<p>He also knew this fact.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Cassion did not neglect a day of training and exercised well.</p>
<p>It was also a kind of compulsion for him. He would think that if he didn’t do this, he would really die.</p>
<p>So it was a routine that he repeated.</p>
<p>Well, looking at his state now, it didn’t seem to be fruitless.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, he had a solid body.</p>
<p>Rosetta reflected on his past as she went over to his apricot skin and removed the dirty bandages.</p>
<p>Her palm grazed over his hard abdomen.</p>
<p>The damp texture had wetted her hands, and at the same time, Cassion flinched.</p>
<p>She looked at his face to see if there would be any small movement, but his eyes were still tightly closed.</p>
<p>To the point that she could feel a vein throb on her forehead.</p>
<p>She stared at the man’s face and felt for the end of the bandage.</p>
<p>It was difficult to grasp, as if looking for the edge of transparent tape.</p>
<p>She raised her finger and looked closely, but she couldn’t see a sign of movement.</p>
<p>Only the muscles of his body that she touched repeatedly contracted and expanded minutely.</p>
<p>While she adjusted the way she sat, she touched his chest and it looked as though he was out of breath.</p>
<p>Whenever Cassion’s body would react, she would stop her ministrations for a while. And by the time he’d be still again, she would move her hand.</p>
<p>Near his belly button.</p>
<p>A little more to the side.</p>
<p>She trailed it down near his waist, then when her fingertips were about to reach his spine—</p>
<p>Tak.</p>
<p>Her wrist was caught.</p>
<p>With a rough touch of his palm, a slight sting could be felt on the inside of her soft wrist.</p>
<p>The hand that held her wrist moved slowly.</p>
<p>He pulled Rosetta’s hand away from his waist and lifted it into the air.</p>
<p>She didn’t try hard to resist, but she followed his movements.</p>
<p>He pretended to sleep so diligently like that, but now he finally admitted that he was awake.</p>
<p>Rosetta kind of pitied him for the foolish acting that made her do this.</p>
<p>“Are you awake?”</p>
<p>When she asked this with a smile, pretending not to know, Cassion had let go of her wrist and sat up.</p>
<p>His cheeks seemed red in the dark.</p>
<p>The ears under his black, tangled hair also looked red.</p>
<p>Even though he lifted his upper body to sit up, his tightly closed eyes only opened then.</p>
<p>Beneath thick dark eyelashes, reproachful eyes flashed open.</p>
<p>“You knew.”</p>
<p>“What exactly?”</p>
<p>“That I was awake.”</p>
<p>“Gosh, of course not.”</p>
<p>When she answered with a smile, Cassion’s lips gaped open as if he was dumbfounded.</p>
<p>“It was obvious that you were sleeping because your eyes were closed.”</p>
<p>“Does a sleeping person flinch like that?”</p>
<p>“Oh, what else should I have done. Your bandages were all soaked. If we leave it as is, your skin would only get bad.”</p>
<p>When Rosetta answered calmly and pointed to his waist, Cassion looked down and clutched his shirt.</p>
<p>“I’ll do it. Give me the bandages.”</p>
<p>With a little urgency in his voice, he reached out his hand.</p>
<p>It was also a bandaged hand.</p>
<p>And it was stained red, too.</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced at his hand, placed the dry bandages on the bed, then took his hand.</p>
<p>For a moment, his fingertips flinched and closed like wilted flowers.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until she grabbed the edge of the bandage and pulled it by force that the hand opened up again.</p>
<p>She felt his gaze on her.</p>
<p>But then the eyes that stared blankly at her hurriedly went away, as if it belonged to a child that was caught doing something wrong.</p>
<p>When she shifted her head to try and meet his shifted gaze, those eyes were averted further again.</p>
<p>‘What’s wrong with you?’</p>
<p>He could look at her properly before.</p>
<p>“If you were awake, then you could have sat up and cooperated. Why did you pretend to be asleep? Perhaps you did that because you wanted me to treat your injuries?”</p>
<p>“It’s not like that.”</p>
<p>The answer was both impatient and firm.</p>
<p>Rosetta had been untangling the bandages, but she stopped moving her hand.</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>She grabbed his chin with one hand so that his eyes wouldn’t try to look away again.</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>The crease between Cassion’s eyebrows deepened at the repeated question.</p>
<p>His lips opened and closed, then, he gulped dryly first before opening his lips to speak once more.</p>
<p>His pupils escaped once more as he looked down.</p>
<p>For example, near her lips…</p>
<p>“Earlier, in the alley…”</p>
<p>“In the alley?”</p>
<p>“Towards me… lips…”</p>
<p>The man who said that pulled away from her grasp.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to do since Rosetta wasn’t gripping his tightly in the first place.</p>
<p>After pulling his hand away, Cassion turned to face her.</p>
<p>The face reflected beneath the moonlight was flared up, as red as an apple.</p>
<p>After listening to his soft breathing for a while, Rosetta tried to understand the broken, stuttering words he spat out.</p>
<p>‘Earlier in the alley, to me… Aha.’</p>
<p>With the combination of his words and his heavily flushed face, and also how he secretly looked at her lips.</p>
<p>It wasn’t difficult to infer what he was saying.</p>
<p>“You… You’ve been awake since then, huh?”</p>
<p>From the moment Rosetta locked lips with him.</p>
<p>No wonder. But she was frightened that he wouldn’t wake up, that’s why she did that.</p>
<p>She thought she was doing that to save him, but it turned out that he had already woken up before she even breathed into him.</p>
<p>Then he would have been frozen in an incomprehensible situation.</p>
<p>There was no such thing as CPR here.</p>
<p>Kissing a dying person was not a situation that could be understood except for the old cliché in a classic novel such as this world.</p>
<p>Moreover, the situation was like she was a person from a remote island floating adrift suddenly kissing someone because the chance presented itself…</p>
<p>Right now, perhaps Cassion was thinking that Rosetta was a shameless person.</p>
<p>Not just the usual shameless person, but a terrible kind of shameless person who would pounce on an unconscious man like that.</p>
<p>“Haha.”</p>
<p>Really, it was a ridiculous misunderstanding that made her laugh in vain.</p>
<p>Beyond the short laugh, she felt a bewildered gaze on her.</p>
<p>Even that gaze was funny, so she couldn’t stop laughing.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she came to a realization only then.</p>
<p>‘Hold on. That means…’</p>
<p>The realization that sharply hinged on that misunderstanding, like an important clue that shouldn’t be missed.</p>
<p>Her laughter, which was dying down gradually, stopped for a moment.</p>
<p>‘If Cassion woke up before I breathed into him…’</p>
<p>Huh.</p>
<p>This time, the laugh had a different reason behind it.</p>
<p>For instance, towards this damn fate, something like awe, delight, resentment.</p>
<p>“Why the hell did you do that?”</p>
<p>By the time she was thinking about how colossal of an enemy this ‘fate’ was, the man’s question broke the silence.</p>
<p>His voice was as rigid as his frozen body.</p>
<p>Instead of answering him, she grabbed his hand.</p>
<p>When his hand on the bed was dragged forward, his upper body gave way and got pulled in.</p>
<p>Face to face with her.</p>
<p>Only one handspan apart. Beyond that, the distance was short as she could see a clear reflection on his black pupils.</p>
<p>Her smiling face could be seen in his red eyes.</p>
<p>“I was trying to save you.”</p>
<p>She didn’t avoid the gaze of the bewildered man.</p>
<p>‘So don’t you dare run away from me again.’</p>
<p>With her eyes fixed on Cassion’s face, she began to untie the bandages wrapped around his hand.</p>
<p>“You… stopped breathing.”</p>
<p>As she said this calmly, the face in front of her hardened.</p>
<p>It was similar to how he looked earlier when he was previously that pale man who stopped breathing.</p>
<p>If there was no warmth in the hand she was holding now, she would have thought that he had collapsed again.</p>
<p>And the pale man’s gaze reminded her of the past.</p>
<p>“Then… That…”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a feeling?</p>
<p>His shallow murmur fell into the dark expanse of the room. The man’s empty hands fumbled onto the back of his neck.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 29</p>
<p>Apparently, Cassion also felt the sensation that he had stopped breathing.</p>
<p>Now that Rosetta saw how energetic he’s being, she thought that it was just a feeling that she sensed for a moment.</p>
<p>She smiled, then she lowered her gaze and focused on the bandage.</p>
<p>“You… died for a moment.”</p>
<p>Like a spider’s web dangling in the air, the bloody bandages were unraveled one by one as silence stretched between them.</p>
<p>“So that you could breathe again, I tried to breathe into you. You cried and told me to save you after all.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“So I pinched your nose and leaned your head back to secure your breath.”</p>
<p>After explaining like this, she glanced at Cassion’s reaction. The more she talked, the more worth it was seeing.</p>
<p>In particular, his expression was the best when she made a pinching gesture as she explained the ‘nose holding’ part.</p>
<p>At that moment, Rosetta realized… that a cold, prideful face could also look stupefied enough.</p>
<p>Secretly amused by this, Rosetta lifted her head once more and made eye contact with Cassion as though she hadn’t been inwardly laughing at him.</p>
<p>“Why the hell… What made you think that way?”</p>
<p>His pale face began to heat up again as he whispered breathlessly.</p>
<p>‘Colorful, too.’</p>
<p>If he changed his expression that much, his face must be doing a lot of work.</p>
<p>“No, never mind.”</p>
<p>The hastily made comment was crude.</p>
<p>Rosetta shrugged, then opened her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“Really? Then that’s that. Well for me, with memories of a first kiss… I thought you’d misunderstand me for this.”</p>
<p>Humming slightly, she lowered her eyes again and focused on his bandages.</p>
<p>In any case, the temperature of the hand she was holding seemed to be higher than before.</p>
<p>As she continued to unravel the bandages, it wouldn’t be long until it’s off entirely, and red stained skin would slowly be revealed.</p>
<p>Feeling something close to assurance, she focused all her concern towards the man’s hand.</p>
<p>‘Indeed, what do I want to see here?’</p>
<p>Soon, the last remaining layer of the bandage fell off his hand and onto the bed.</p>
<p>Plop.</p>
<p>With a dull noise, the palm of the man was revealed.</p>
<p>Hard calluses.</p>
<p>Old scars with unknown origins.</p>
<p>New scars that had yet to settle in.</p>
<p>Wounds.</p>
<p>No, they were scars.</p>
<p>‘As expected.’</p>
<p>His palms were dyed red only because his bandages were soaked with blood, but that was it.</p>
<p>The wounds under the poorly opened bandages were steadily healing.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t even have guessed that he got hurt there today had she not known.</p>
<p>Her heart pounded.</p>
<p>As though regaining something once abandoned. No, as though realizing that what had once been given up had already come true.</p>
<p>The wounds that healed at an abnormal rate was evidence of his healing due to the momentary mana amplification that was described in the novel.</p>
<p>In short, this meant that mana had begun to circulate within Cassion’s body.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like he noticed yet.</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>In the novel, she thought he realized it shortly after.</p>
<p>‘Is it that he couldn’t notice it because he’s so focused on the matter of touching lips…?’</p>
<p>She wondered why it was like this, but she thought this might be the likely situation.</p>
<p>When a person was distracted by something, they wouldn’t even know they were hurt.</p>
<p>Just as you wouldn’t feel a papercut until the moment you see it.</p>
<p>With both thumbs, Rosetta relaxedly swept over Cassion’s scars on his hand.</p>
<p>“What’re you doing?”</p>
<p>Cassion flinched as he asked.</p>
<p>His face, on which the red tinge had not subsided, looked like a lovely, blushing boy.</p>
<p>No, he really was lovely. As if looking at a child she was proud of, Rosetta’s heart was full of endearment.</p>
<p>“Do you know how many times I saved your life today?”</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Cassion only blinked in return.</p>
<p>The way his eyes flitted left and right, it seemed as though he was counting in his head.</p>
<p>That, or he might be hesitating to say sorry.</p>
<p>He had forgotten the first instance, he wasn’t happy with the second instance, and the third instance was misunderstood as a shameless act.</p>
<p>At this point, he might be thinking that Rosetta had taken him out of the waters to save him from drowning, but she was not only asking for compensation, but that she had slapped him and was asking for money in return as well.</p>
<p>“…Three times……?”</p>
<p>At his belated response, she shook her head.</p>
<p>“Bzzt. Wrong.”</p>
<p>She didn’t save Cassion three times today.</p>
<p>His abnormally fast-paced healing was evidence to this.</p>
<p>Perhaps his waist’s condition wouldn’t be so different.</p>
<p>“I did save you that first and second time, but I didn’t during the third.”</p>
<p>She said this in an almost sing-song voice.</p>
<p>“Then who saved me during the third time?”</p>
<p>And his tone was that of befuddlement, his brows furrowed.</p>
<p>Rosetta brushed Cassion’s hand with her thumb again. Feeling the bumps of his callouses, she lifted her own hand and reached near his heart.</p>
<p>Despite the slow movement, Cassion did not avoid her.</p>
<p>Because they were already so close together, she touched his chest without having to reach far.</p>
<p>“This.”</p>
<p>She felt his hardened muscles.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Whenever he breathed, she felt his chest rise and fall.</p>
<p>And, here.</p>
<p>Caged by his ribs, she could feel his heart beating.</p>
<p>Yes, his heart.</p>
<p>She felt the beating of his heart, and she could sense the subtle flow around it—the weak sensation of mana flowing from his heart. Mana, magic.</p>
<p>‘I was worried that I wouldn’t feel it, but…’</p>
<p>She could feel mana from his heart and internal strength¹ from his core.</p>
<p>Even if the core and the manner of use was different, there was a similarity with a ‘certain energy’ that flowed within her.</p>
<p>So perhaps that’s why Rosetta could feel his mana.</p>
<p>In this novel’s setting, the only person who could feel mana was another person who could also wield mana, but the power she had was something that didn’t fit this place.</p>
<p>But luckily, her earlier assumption seemed to be correct.</p>
<p>A similar yet deviant energy pierced through the unwritten laws of the novel’s worldbuilding, and so she had become able to feel the flow of ‘mana’.</p>
<p>‘And if mana could be felt…’</p>
<p>The easiest and most efficient way of making Cassion stronger was now possible.</p>
<p>‘To open up his pathways².’</p>
<p>Rosetta’s slender fingers folded towards her palm, leaving only her index finger pointed out towards Cassion’s thin shirt. There, she circled over where his heart should be.</p>
<p>“Uh… What are you doing.”</p>
<p>He froze up but immediately flinched back in embarrassment. But he couldn’t move back much because the bed’s headboard was right behind him.</p>
<p>“How is it, can’t you feel anything?”</p>
<p>At the subtle question, the man’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Anyway, it felt like there was a pattern here.</p>
<p>Rosetta would move, then Cassion would jump back like a startled rabbit.</p>
<p>“Feel? I don’t feel anything, so your hand, just… Ah.”</p>
<p>Cassion was trying to talk to Rosetta with a firm tone, but he stopped mid-sentence.</p>
<p>It seemed that he had finally recognized something ‘strange’ within him, and that prompted his ability to sense it.</p>
<p>“Urk…”</p>
<p>With a pained groan, he grabbed his heart. Then, he hunched over and bowed his head forward.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>The hand that she was holding escaped from her grasp as he clutched his chest.</p>
<p>His harsh breathing quickly took over the dark, quiet room.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared at him. She wordlessly approached him and held his faltering upper body, folding him into her arms.</p>
<p>His large frame clung close to her as though he was a beast that had found haven for itself.</p>
<p>She could feel the man’s warm cheek touching her shoulder.</p>
<p>And with the moisture that trickled down, she didn’t know whether it was Cassion’s sweat or his tears.</p>
<p>She didn’t think this happened in the novel, but…</p>
<p>‘Do people become more child-like if they have someone they could lean on?’</p>
<p>With a rather cold sentiment, Rosetta wrapped her arms around the man’s searing body.</p>
<p>“Shh… It’s alright.”</p>
<p>She whispered into the red ears near her face.</p>
<p>When she patted his back lightly, his restless body continued to tremble.</p>
<p>While patting Cassion’s back, she secretly explored his pathways.</p>
<p>‘There are a lot of blockages.’</p>
<p>There were places where his mana flowed freely, but not many of them.</p>
<p>The pathways were mostly empty, and the mana that did flow was a pitiful amount.</p>
<p>Gathering qi into her hands, she pointed to one of his blocked pathways. She kept her pointer and middle fingers together and pushed down briefly.</p>
<p>Cassion gasped, the sound of it accompanied by a sudden breath touching her shoulder.</p>
<p>As the shallow breath was spat out, Rosetta collected the energy on her fingertips.</p>
<p>When she checked the place she had just pressed down on, mana was now flowing through the newly opened pathway.</p>
<p>‘Still, maybe this is too much for a recovering patient.’</p>
<p>Listening to his countless groans in between shallow breaths, Rosetta felt guilty for some reason.</p>
<p>Even so, she’d have to proceed with opening up his pathways a little later.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the patient wasn’t the only one here who’s overdoing it.</p>
<p>Cough.</p>
<p>At that moment, a dry cough was spat out.</p>
<p>She could tell what the hot liquid flowing down the side of her lips was without having to check.</p>
<p>‘Ah, right… I overdid it, too.’</p>
<p>During the carriage incident, she ran up the cliff carrying Cassion on her back, then she dragged the horse and pushed it to the bottom of the cliff.</p>
<p>This was to deceive the eyes of Leo and the others, who would come later to inspect the scene. She scattered Cassion’s blood to make it look like he crawled to the river stream and was washed away.</p>
<p>What else. She also went to catch Cassion… and she faced those men in the alley.</p>
<p>Then she carried Cassion again as they returned to the hotel.</p>
<p>It was clear that it was a tough day for the fragile body and unstable power that she had.</p>
<p>After roughly wiping the blood off her lips with a sleeve, she patted Cassion’s back once again.</p>
<p>“Cassion, breathe. Take a deep breath and get some rest.”</p>
<p>Along with my words, Cassion’s ribs swelled and sank over and over.</p>
<p>As he did, the mana that had been haphazardly tangled gradually regained stability.</p>
<p>“It’s fine now. Everything’s okay, so just breathe.”</p>
<p>His rough gasps gradually softened. The sound of his breaths that were once heavy with pain had changed, no longer seeming as if his throat was being scratched.</p>
<p>Over time, the shoulder where his face grew prickly and warm.</p>
<p>“Cassion?”</p>
<p>When she called out his name and was answered back by only an ensuing silence, the man who gulped dryly raised his head with great difficulty.</p>
<p>The eyes that were close to her were a deep crimson shade.</p>
<p>Like scorching lava.</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>t/n:</p>
<p>1. what Rosetta mentions here is 내공, which is a term used in the practice of martial arts. it originally means ‘the strength and vigor gained by a long period of training’ or ‘abilities gained by intensive training over time’, but i translated this word simply as ‘internal strength’</p>
<p>2. the ‘pathways’ mentioned here refer to the channels or meridians in which qi (or: chi, energy, vitality—and in this case—mana) flows</p>
<p>side note: from this point onwards, i’ll be translating the 기 that Rosetta mentions from time to time as ‘qi’ to hark back to her power from her second transmigration. this will be different from when she mentions 기운, which i’ll be translating as ‘energy’, ‘force’ or ‘vitality’, and 힘 which i’ll be translating as ‘strength’, ‘force’ or ‘power’</p>
<p>it’s confusing, yes. i didn’t know i’d have to research so much martial arts stuff for a romance fantasy novel either lol</p>
<p>side side note: why is Rosetta so swoon-worthy huh?? who told her to be so cool??? i lowkey have a crush on her now aslkjdf who’s with me here</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 30</p>
<p>As Rosetta stared at him silently, the man bit his lips and struggled to sit up against the headboard.</p>
<p>His face was red. The reddest on it was his red, fiery eyes.</p>
<p>And the red eyes were wet with moisture.</p>
<p>What had soaked Rosetta’s shoulder seemed to be his tears.</p>
<p>Staring into the air and gasping for breath, he clutched his chest and had a broken smile on his lips.</p>
<p>“Is this… the power… that I think it is?”</p>
<p>It was a forlorn voice. Or rather, it was an emotional tone.</p>
<p>With a feeling that was hard to tell, Rosetta only answered quietly.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. I’m sure you’re right.”</p>
<p>The man still stared blankly into the air as he clutched his chest with both hands, his knuckles turning white as he did.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth, and from there, the sound of his teeth clenching could be heard clearly.</p>
<p>And with that, a broad smile tugged up on his lips.</p>
<p>“This is… mana? The power that I’ve never had… It’s this…?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“Just barely, this power…! You say this is what’s been strangling me?”</p>
<p>But the murmur didn’t sound like a question.</p>
<p>It was probably a question for Rosetta to answer, or something that he’s throwing out into the world. If not that, it was either a muttering of joy or resentment.</p>
<p>Tears streamed down his cheeks.</p>
<p>And the tears that started being shed continued to flow down unknowingly.</p>
<p>Like a broken faucet, the man gritted his teeth and cried.</p>
<p>If he made a sound, more tears would come out.</p>
<p>The tears that fell down accompanied by not one sound was sorrowful.</p>
<p>With Rosetta like a cold autumn night, she quietly watched the man, who was like a warm midsummer’s day, as he silently raised a hand to wipe his eyes.</p>
<p>The gaze that was staring into the air turned to Rosetta. Those red eyes, which were still so full of tears, burned as though they were about to shed blood as tears.</p>
<p>Rosetta lightly wiped his cheek and spoke.</p>
<p>“Congratulations. You are now a Carter who can wield magic.”</p>
<p>With the small congratulations, his forlorn tears were shed once more.</p>
<p>And what was better this time was that his cries were accompanied by sound.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile.</p>
<p>Late night at another location—</p>
<p>Devoured by a never-ending darkness, the forest was enshrouded with a gloomy air.</p>
<p>Viridescent yet pitch black.</p>
<p>Falling leaves.</p>
<p>The gleaming eyes of beasts.</p>
<p>Several giant birds soared through the air above the dark forest.</p>
<p>Fweep. Screech.</p>
<p>The sound, whether it was wings flapping or beaks screeching, tore through the air.</p>
<p>Like a warning towards the unfamiliar.</p>
<p>“Here… It is here, sir.”</p>
<p>However, the warnings of the forest did nothing to stop the strangers who had come into the forest.</p>
<p>They were uninvited guests who were dressed in clothes as dark as the forest.</p>
<p>The only one who wasn’t wearing dark clothes was the lean, thin man at the forefront of the group.</p>
<p>He was brushing off his clothes that were full of dirt, but the smile on his face was full of greed.</p>
<p>“Here?”</p>
<p>The man standing behind the thin man responded.</p>
<p>When the red gaze reached him, the thin man’s shoulders shrank.</p>
<p>“Yes, over there… You see the carriage, yes?”</p>
<p>His body cowered to the fullest as he pointed towards that direction with both hands.</p>
<p>Those red eyes moved like quiet lava.</p>
<p>Towards the direction pointed at by the skinny fingers, a devastated landscape could be seen.</p>
<p>Beyond the foliage, there was a shattered carriage atop pebbles and a ruined patch of grass.</p>
<p>And there was a cold horse that had lost its life.</p>
<p>No, there was one that fell on its back, so there were two in total.</p>
<p>Even the bloodstains had turned brown in several places.</p>
<p>“I definitely saw them jump off after I pulled the reins, sir. The surprised horses sped off and I saw with my own two eyes how they fell down the cliff.”</p>
<p>Was that all?</p>
<p>The young master’s face quickly became enraged and his eyes were sharp with anger.</p>
<p>The coachman, who had driven the carriage that Cassion rode on, swallowed back his words, but he smiled insidiously.</p>
<p>He couldn’t help but smile as he looked at the devastating sight, thinking of the money that would soon fall to his hands.</p>
<p>And that money was from his work of labor.</p>
<p>And the man who was in front of him was Leo Carter, the one who ordered this carriage accident, and the one who would be paying him.</p>
<p>Indeed, as the successor of a Duchy, the amount offered was considerable.</p>
<p>‘Now that you’re the only successor left, maybe you’ll give me something more precious than the money you offered.’</p>
<p>While the coachman drooled as he thought of his greed,</p>
<p>“Yes, you saw it.”</p>
<p>Leo’s lips twisted up as he said this, looking at the scene silently.</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right, sir. I saw it very clearly.”</p>
<p>The coachman didn’t miss the chance to answer enthusiastically and bowed his head.</p>
<p>As he dropped his gaze, he didn’t see the sneer that was directed at him.</p>
<p>“Clean it up.”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>At the brief order, the coachman raised his head. However, he couldn’t see Leo’s face.</p>
<p>Even before he could lift his head, sharp, jagged ice had pierced his stomach.</p>
<p>“Urk…”</p>
<p>Along with a dying groan, the thin man’s body fell.</p>
<p>His blurred view could see only Leo’s back.</p>
<p>Without any guilt, it was a straight, broad back that passed by the thin man.</p>
<p>Thud.</p>
<p>And the body, which had been holding itself up on its knees on the ground, finally collapsed.</p>
<p>At the dull sound, the person walking next to Leo glanced back.</p>
<p>“How should we proceed, sir?”</p>
<p>Leo only nodded.</p>
<p>Well, there was no need to ask such a useless question.</p>
<p>“Take care of it and leave no trace behind. As if he never existed in this world.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Soon after the person answered concisely, he turned to the men behind him and gave his orders.</p>
<p>Then, some men headed towards the coachman’s body.</p>
<p>Without mercy, the men twisted the dead man’s cold ankles and dragged his body away, disappearing through the forest.</p>
<p>Leo and the other men approached the shattered carriage.</p>
<p>It was the center of the disastrous scene, the place where there was the most blood.</p>
<p>Leo, who reached that place first, slowly crouched down.</p>
<p>As he went lower, the huge bloodstains became clearer. However, the body he was looking for was nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The smell of metallic blood reached the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>“My older brother has a long lifeline, huh.”</p>
<p>Along with the grim murmur, Leo’s lips drew a deep arc.</p>
<p>It was the metallic smell of blood.</p>
<p>Leo touched the dry blood with his fingertips.</p>
<p>Only reddish-brown chunks could be found amidst the dry, hardened bloodstain.</p>
<p>Staring at what was on his fingertips with a twisted expression on his face, Leo soon stood up, shaking his hand.</p>
<p>“I believe he ran away, sir.”</p>
<p>The mage who stabbed the coachman with eyes bowed his head and spoke up.</p>
<p>He was the same person who asked Leo how they should dispose of the coachman’s body.</p>
<p>Looking down at the mage, Leo replied in a humming tone.</p>
<p>“I know because I have eyes, too. Yeah, I think my dear older brother ran away like a rat.”</p>
<p>“Shall I find his trail and chase after him?”</p>
<p>“That’s how it should be.”</p>
<p>No matter how much he struggled, there was no way he’d come back alive from this.</p>
<p>As Leo mentioned earlier, his brother had a very persistent lifeline.</p>
<p>Even though his life had been threatened several times, it was testimony enough that he managed to live to see the day that he reached adulthood.</p>
<p>No one tried to help save him. Though he was like a fleeting candle swaying in the wind, his fire had yet to be put out.</p>
<p>It almost made Leo want to applaud him.</p>
<p>However, it was impossible for him to admire Cassion’s persistent vitality forever.</p>
<p>Because his foolish older brother had become an adult.</p>
<p>Next year, when Leo himself would pass his own birthday and he’d reach adulthood as well, the competition for the successorship of the Duchy would begin in earnest.</p>
<p>For successor candidates who had come of age, there was a set procedure.</p>
<p>Of course, Cassion was a candidate who had no mana despite being part of a family of mages, he had no base of support, he had no other family members to aid him and he had no property at all. But even so, a less than half bastard candidate was still a candidate.</p>
<p>As long as Cassion was a candidate for succession, he posed the weak possibility of ‘what if’.</p>
<p>And a weak possibility was still a possibility.</p>
<p>What was not 0% could turn into a miracle because the hope for a coup would be fostered.</p>
<p>An opponent to the successorship, a competitor, an enemy.</p>
<p>‘Someone to get rid of.’</p>
<p>From a very young age, these were the words that his mother continued to tell him.</p>
<p>’It doesn’t matter who the other person is or how small of a threat he poses. Some people lose their lives even by being bitten by an ant.’</p>
<p>‘Then what should be important?’</p>
<p>‘Presence, absence. If it doesn’t exist in the first place, it isn’t even a threat. So…’</p>
<p>If there was even the slightest chance to harm him… then he should get rid of it while he could.</p>
<p>That was the surefire way to win.</p>
<p>When hearing this for the first time, it would sound cruel, but his mother’s method always had sure results.</p>
<p>Therefore, Leo never thought that his mother’s method was wrong.</p>
<p>A fruitless method was nothing but an excuse, and a method that produced sure results was the only right answer.</p>
<p>Then it was only right to take care of anything that had even the smallest chance while he could.</p>
<p>Until Leo would come of age on his birthday in the following year, Cassion must die.</p>
<p>The most certain way to become the successor was to have only one candidate for the succession race in the first place.</p>
<p>“Young Duke, I found a bloodstain leading to a nearby river.”</p>
<p>He was still not officially the heir to the Duchy, but the people around him called him Young Duke and followed his words.</p>
<p>According to the right etiquette, it was not the correct title for him, but no one pointed this out.</p>
<p>Leo turned around casually and looked towards the ground.</p>
<p>As the man said, there were bloodstains over the overgrown weeds and gravel next to the river.</p>
<p>‘Did you go down the river, or.’</p>
<p>Did he try to struggle and go against the currents?</p>
<p>The latter was the more dangerous choice, but Cassion probably would have chosen to die through struggling rather than to die without doing anything.</p>
<p>“He couldn’t have gotten far anyway, so look for any signs of torn clothes or anything. The highest possibility is that he moved along with the river’s current.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Young Duke.”</p>
<p>After the group of men wearing black cloaks answered in unison, they left one by one to do their work.</p>
<p>Leo looked towards where those people disappeared to, then he turned his gaze back towards the dry blood.</p>
<p>He loved this terrible sight.</p>
<p>It would have been perfect if his older brother’s body was here with him.</p>
<p>‘It would be great if you’re dead, but…’</p>
<p>“I’ll teach you a lesson instead. I’ll make you know that death might have been better for you.”</p>
<p>He would let him know that the misfortunes he had experienced thus far was nothing at all.</p>
<p>As if his tongue could already taste it, he licked his red lips.</p>
<p>Like a snake.</p>
<p>Red tongue, red lips, red eyes, red hair.</p>
<p>The crimson man smiled fiercely, and it was as though he himself was covered in blood.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 31</p>
<p>In the original—</p>
<p>「 After the accident, Cassion, who now had mana, ran straight through the thick grass field of the forest.</p>
<p>His body, which had yet to recover, was wracked with pain, but he couldn’t stop.</p>
<p>There was no time.</p>
<p>If it was the Leo that he knew, he would go to the scene of the incident leading a group behind him.</p>
<p>To get rid of him perfectly.</p>
<p>If Cassion gets caught, he’ll die. Even if he was caught now with mana, he would still die.</p>
<p>When Cassion still couldn’t use mana, Leo was already antsy because he couldn’t kill Cassion, but if he knew now that his older brother could use mana, Cassion would surely disappear without a trace.</p>
<p>Cassion ran through the foliage, gritting his teeth.</p>
<p>He could feel the galloping of horses from afar.</p>
<p>But when he looked back, there was nothing there.</p>
<p>What was it, this hallucination that he couldn’t ever seem to shake off, keeping him on his feet.</p>
<p>Cassion was exhausted as he gasped and shed tears. He couldn’t tell what those tears were for.</p>
<p>Joy, perhaps, or sadness about only now being able to wield mana.</p>
<p>Without having the time to feel those emotions, he just urged his legs forward—to live.</p>
<p>It was a terribly lonely way to survive.</p>
<p>Just as it always was. 」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Rattle.</p>
<p>The carriage rattled lightly as it ran over stones.</p>
<p>At the same time, the head of the woman sleeping against the carriage window was also shaken.</p>
<p>As the carriage quivered, silver hair could also be seen trembling.</p>
<p>The woman’s tightly closed eyes were scrunched up.</p>
<p>Just as her forehead was wrinkled, it was clear that she was feeling uncomfortable.</p>
<p>It was as if she was about to wake up. Mmm… She moaned in her sleep, but she soon regained a peaceful expression as she slept more.</p>
<p>‘What on earth are you dreaming about?’</p>
<p>Opposite her was Cassion, who smiled faintly as he watched the sleeping Rosetta.</p>
<p>However, the corners of his lips that slightly rose soon hardened awkwardly the moment she spoke in her sleep.</p>
<p>“Survive, Cassion…”</p>
<p>Furtively, through a small gap between her lips, she murmured.</p>
<p>Cassion stared blankly in surprise at Rosetta, then he stiffly turned his head.</p>
<p>The sight of a verdant green summer flashed through the open curtains.</p>
<p>He looked out the window for no reason, and with his eyes directed outside, he swept a hand through his hair.</p>
<p>‘Ah.’</p>
<p>It was different from usual. He was used to long hair being caught through his fingers, but his hair was now cut short enough that it would quickly pass through his hand.</p>
<p>This was due to the haircut he had before the carriage departed.</p>
<p>With a subtle awkwardness, he recalled again where he was now heading.</p>
<p>He forgot for a while because he was just staring at the person who fell asleep.</p>
<p>Right now, he was on his way to the Valentine estate.</p>
<p>And he had since abandoned the name ‘Cassion’.</p>
<p>’For you to survive, Cassion must stay dead for the time being.’</p>
<p>Rosetta said this as she handed him a piece of paper with something written on it.</p>
<p>It was someone’s personal information.</p>
<p>It was the identity he would have to assume in the future.</p>
<p>Where he was born, how old he was.</p>
<p>His habits and hobbies.</p>
<p>Family relationship, friends.</p>
<p>Special memories of the past and his current situation.</p>
<p>On the document that listed someone’s life, the two syllables of the unfamiliar name could be seen.</p>
<p>‘Maxwell.’</p>
<p>This was the name he received in turn for abandoning the name ‘Cassion’.</p>
<p>But this was not the only thing done to hide his identity.</p>
<p>He was wearing an earring that changed his hair and eye color.</p>
<p>The downside to this was that he could never lose this earring, but it was the first time that Cassion, who lived in the Carter Duchy, had seen himself like this.</p>
<p>His black hair had turned into a dark blue color that was reminiscent of the night sky, and his red eyes, which was the symbol of the Carter family, had been changed to black eyes.</p>
<p>His hair had previously been long enough to cover his eyes, but it was now cut short enough to clearly reveal the shape of his eyes.</p>
<p>At this point, if he were to look at a mirror at first glance, he would still be surprised because of his unfamiliar appearance.</p>
<p>Cassion swept a hand through his hair stiffly once more.</p>
<p>As expected, it was awkward.</p>
<p>However, if he did it more often to get used to it, the awkwardness gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>The short hair under the touch of his fingers, the black gaze reflected against the glass window.</p>
<p>And the new sensation flowing within his body…</p>
<p>‘Maxwell.’</p>
<p>Even the name couldn’t be said without his mouth twitching.</p>
<p>Leaning against the window, Cassion smiled silently.</p>
<p>Funnily enough, all these unfamiliar things felt safer than those that were familiar to him.</p>
<p>Through thinly curved eyes, his gaze smoothly headed towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>The most unfamiliar yet, strangely, the most reassuring being.</p>
<p>The carriage gradually slowed down.</p>
<p>“We’ll be arriving soon, Milady.”</p>
<p>The loud voice of the coachman came from outside the window.</p>
<p>And Rosetta’s eyelashes quivered.</p>
<p>As her eyelids slowly showed her eyes, they looked like two full moons on a midsummer night.</p>
<p>“Maxwell?”</p>
<p>Rosetta, who just woke up, unhesitatingly called the unfamiliar name.</p>
<p>Then, Cassion also nodded without hesitation.</p>
<p>Ah, it’s finally started.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Young Duke, the Princess has just arrived.”</p>
<p>Sitting in front of a desk that he hadn’t left all night, Damian’s hand stopped moving.</p>
<p>His eyes were closed for a moment because of a headache, but they soon headed towards the butler as he mentioned the news.</p>
<p>After the silence that stretched between them, there was a brief question asked.</p>
<p>“And her condition?”</p>
<p>“I don’t believe she had been hurt anywhere.”</p>
<p>“…Alright.”</p>
<p>Following the calm voice was a light sigh of relief.</p>
<p>He was so nervous that she left without even a single knight to escort her.</p>
<p>However, when she said that she wished to spend time ‘alone’ with such an exhausted face, he couldn’t refuse her request.</p>
<p>He was nothing but a sinner in front of Rosetta.</p>
<p>’I’m sorry.’</p>
<p>And she only limped away from the apology that he uttered fleetingly. Something that lingered, affection, yearning.</p>
<p>It was a back that seemed to move away without leaving anything behind.</p>
<p>Her appearance back then was his doing. His brief apology, just ‘I’m sorry’, was evidence of his crime.</p>
<p>A large hand swept over his face.</p>
<p>Calluses were felt over that hand.</p>
<p>It was cold.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>Revolting.</p>
<p>The incident with Katie was only a few days ago.</p>
<p>When Rosetta collapsed to the floor covered with blood, Katie knelt down in front of him and claimed her innocence.</p>
<p>To be honest, he didn’t know what to believe.</p>
<p>Perhaps Rosetta was lying. Perhaps this was all orchestrated.</p>
<p>Without Alicia appearing right then, he was unsure whether he would have locked up Katie in the dungeon.</p>
<p>Even at this moment.</p>
<p>And it must have been noticed by Rosetta as well.</p>
<p>She had asked him who he believed now, and this was proof enough that she knew.</p>
<p>‘I’m sorry.’</p>
<p>It was proof enough when she did not look back at his belated apology.</p>
<p>How much pain did this memory give Rosetta? He couldn’t even imagine it.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, he lived all his life avoiding her. For him, Rosetta herself symbolized the uncomfortable truth.</p>
<p>He avoided her because he was afraid of resentment or hatred, and whenever he faced her, he couldn’t hide his discomfort.</p>
<p>Even though he knew this would hurt Rosetta, he turned a blind eye in order for himself not to get hurt.</p>
<p>But to top it all off—he tried once again to turn a blind eye to her even at the most crucial moment.</p>
<p>‘Absolutely revolting.’</p>
<p>A terrible sense of guilt was strangling him.</p>
<p>He hated her without realizing it even when his mother told him not to hate the innocent child, and now, questions arose whether he should have or should not have done so.</p>
<p>It was too late, these questions.</p>
<p>He realized all these while looking at Rosetta, who no longer looked back.</p>
<p>“Where’s Rosetta?”</p>
<p>“The Lady is in the guest room right now.”</p>
<p>“Not her room, but the guest room. Why?”</p>
<p>Damian brows furrowed at the unexpected answer.</p>
<p>However, the next answer made him even more perplexed.</p>
<p>“That is, the Lady brought a person—a man—home.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Sister.”</p>
<p>After hearing a short knock, Rosetta opened the door and there, Alicia appeared with a timid yet cheerful voice.</p>
<p>Entering the guest room, Alicia’s eyes widened as she glanced inside.</p>
<p>“Alicia.”</p>
<p>When Rosetta called her name, Alicia quickly approached her and grabbed her arm, whispering.</p>
<p>“I heard that Sister came back today, so… I came to see you, but…”</p>
<p>Her eyes were still wide as she looked into the room.</p>
<p>She expected that there would be at most just Rosetta or a few maids with her, but she was surprised to see that there were more people than she thought.</p>
<p>And lying on the bed was Cassion, and there was a doctor examining him.</p>
<p>Some maids and attendants were carrying medicines and soaked towels.</p>
<p>Alicia glanced towards Cassion, curious about the stranger she was seeing for the first time.</p>
<p>“Sister, who is that person? He looks like he’s hurt… Did Sister bring him here?”</p>
<p>Rosetta simply smiled and nodded at the whisper that flowed into her ear.</p>
<p>Somehow, it felt like she had to answer in the same hushed tone, Rosetta leaned forward slightly and whispered.</p>
<p>“Yes, I brought him here.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>The wide eyes simply blinked and asked for the reason. After that, as soon as Rosetta was about to answer—</p>
<p>Again, another character appeared with the sound of a knock.</p>
<p>That character strode into the open door, and Rosetta locked eyes with him. Instantly, the air was charged with an awkward, uncomfortable air.</p>
<p>“Brother.”</p>
<p>The first one to call him was Alicia.</p>
<p>With her arm still linked with Rosetta’s, Alicia waved to him with the same hand, and Rosetta’s body moved along as well.</p>
<p>Rosetta curtsied quietly and greeted Damian.</p>
<p>“I’ve returned, Brother.”</p>
<p>Her voice rang clearly amidst the slightly noisy room.</p>
<p>When she gently curved her eyes into a smile, Damian’s narrow eyes hardened.</p>
<p>Evidently, it was the face of a sinner who was struggling with guilt.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 32</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>A slightly subdued voice called to her.</p>
<p>On top of the awkward greeting, Damian, who couldn’t hide his exhaustion, walked towards her.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was to blame for the visible tiredness on his face.</p>
<p>With that strong guess in mind, Rosetta let out a shallow sigh.</p>
<p>When her shoulders shook as she exhaled, Damian and Alicia’s eyes went straight to her at the same time.</p>
<p>By now, Damian must be feeling terribly guilty.</p>
<p>On the day of the incident with Katie, it was enough to see this when he gave that apology, along with his affirmative answer to her request to go out without a knight.</p>
<p>‘I’m truly, terribly sorry.’</p>
<p>He tried to hide his feelings, but Rosetta could tell from his eyes and by the way he was breathing.</p>
<p>So Rosetta had to use what she had to her advantage.</p>
<p>If there was someone pitying her, then she would pretend to be more pitiful. If someone was feeling sorry for her, then by all means, she would have to look more pathetic.</p>
<p>Before Damian could open his lips to speak, Rosetta beat him to the punch.</p>
<p>“I’m really sorry. I should have gone to greet you first the moment I returned, but I thought that I should bring this person to the doctor first.”</p>
<p>With closed lips, his gaze shifted from me towards the other person.</p>
<p>And where that gaze connected was Cassion, who was lying on the bed while receiving treatment.</p>
<p>His shallow breathing could be heard, and the way Damian looked at him was sharp.</p>
<p>‘It shouldn’t be possible, so you shouldn’t notice.’</p>
<p>Cassion’s black hair had already been changed to dark blue hair, and now his eyes were black.</p>
<p>And his hairstyle was changed, too.</p>
<p>They didn’t know each other personally, so now that his eye color and hair color had changed, there shouldn’t be a possibility of getting caught, but…</p>
<p>Rosetta couldn’t ignore the possibility of ‘one in a thousand’.</p>
<p>‘If we get caught here, the plans will get derailed.’</p>
<p>With her eyes down, she looked closely at Damian’s reaction.</p>
<p>His expression showed his discomfort. Then his lips, which were all chewed up, opened slowly.</p>
<p>“…Who is this man that you brought here?”</p>
<p>Oh, you didn’t recognize him.</p>
<p>Rosetta held her other arm and dug down the nails of her index and middle fingers. A sharp sensation could be felt, along with a strange sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>Blocking the laughter bubbling up with that sharp touch, she opened her lips with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“It’s… It’s a little complicated.”</p>
<p>“…Complicated?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Truthfully, I nearly got hurt. I almost went down a flight of stairs because I wasn’t paying attention.”</p>
<p>“Oh my goodness!”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Two voices answered back at the same time.</p>
<p>The pressure on her arm grew tighter as she glanced up at the person next to Damian. Alicia looked very shocked.</p>
<p>“I’m al—”</p>
<p>“Are you alright, Sister? Did you get hurt anywhere? Did you get injured?”</p>
<p>Damian’s urgency disappeared after hearing Alicia’s voice.</p>
<p>She was someone who couldn’t even speak loudly in a crowded place like this, but the moment she heard that Rosetta almost got hurt, she immediately rushed to her sister’s side and looked around to see if she was injured anywhere.</p>
<p>Rosetta comforted Alicia by patting her shoulder.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. I wasn’t hurt at all.”</p>
<p>Alicia, who looked like she was about to take off Rosetta’s clothes any moment now, stopped fumbling, then looked up at her with a smile.</p>
<p>Rosetta stroked the lovely Alicia’s hair. Then, she lifted her gaze and looked towards Damian.</p>
<p>The eyes looking back were wide open.</p>
<p>As if he had moved unknowingly, the distance narrowed by a step, but that was all.</p>
<p>His arm flinched once, but it was such a minute action that it could be dismissed as nothing.</p>
<p>With that delicate distance between them, Rosetta and Damian faced each other.</p>
<p>“Did you really… not get hurt?”</p>
<p>The unfriendly voice asked a clumsy question.</p>
<p>His discomfort couldn’t be erased, and Rosetta almost laughed at this.</p>
<p>‘That’s a relief. I was worried that you’d start treating me like a real family member of yours just because you’re feeling a little guilty.’</p>
<p>If he had made a decision like, ‘Let’s start thinking of Rosetta like a real sister!’ out of that foolish guilt, then she would have been placed in a difficult position.</p>
<p>Because she thought that this relationship between them now was already perfect.</p>
<p>Moderate discomfort. Moderate guilt.</p>
<p>Perhaps, he would even be uncomfortable with her his whole life.</p>
<p>Every time he’d call her name, he’d feel uncomfortable, and just the same, he’d feel guilty.</p>
<p>It was quite the favorable situation.</p>
<p>Hating her would have been troublesome because it would hinder the path she was set to walk in the future, but at the same time, she didn’t want them to be close enough because he would put surveillance on her in the name of ‘family’.</p>
<p>…And she was afraid that he’d find out that she was a fake.</p>
<p>Anyway, this moderate discomfort and guilt was the best balance for their brother and sisterly relationship because it would provide her with the most favorable conditions.</p>
<p>The original Rosetta might have been sad because of this line that Damian was drawing between them, but ‘she’ wasn’t Rosetta.</p>
<p>At the silence that stretched between them, she looked away first.</p>
<p>“I’m fine. It was him who fell down the stairs instead of me.”</p>
<p>“That person?”</p>
<p>After staring at nothing in particular for a moment, holding her tongue, she looked back at Damian again and nodded.</p>
<p>Those golden irises faced Rosetta’s once more. And with a more relaxed expression than before, she spoke.</p>
<p>“Yes. He fell down the stairs because of me. He seemed to have been hurt a lot, so I brought him home…”</p>
<p>The excuse she decided to use to bring Cassion home was that he was her savior.</p>
<p>Damian was an upright man. Even as he didn’t entirely agree with his mother’s will, he tried to accept Rosetta as family. But when he couldn’t accept her fully, he felt guilty for it.</p>
<p>There’s no way that such a person would easily make light of a savior.</p>
<p>Damian swept a hand over his face as though he had a throbbing headache.</p>
<p>Then, he quietly turned towards the doctor examining Cassion and asked him.</p>
<p>“How is that man doing?”</p>
<p>“There are bruises here and there, and he seems to have a gash on one side, but… fortunately, it’s not a big injury. However, it might interfere with his daily life for a while.”</p>
<p>“Goodness…”</p>
<p>While listening to the doctor, Rosetta let out a small sigh.</p>
<p>She could feel Alicia looking towards her worriedly.</p>
<p>Rosetta kept mum for a while, but after a moment, she opened her lips and spoke with a heavy voice.</p>
<p>“Brother.”</p>
<p>At the low whisper, Damian’s eyes shifted entirely towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>She looked down towards her index finger and thumb that were facing each other, her lips shaking.</p>
<p>“I… I know it’s shameless of me to bring this up when you’re already worrying about me this much, but… Brother, I would like to ask a favor.”</p>
<p>A favor.</p>
<p>Damian’s eyes widened at Rosetta’s earnest plea.</p>
<p>Hooded by thick eyelashes, Rosetta’s own golden eyes met with Damian’s.</p>
<p>Originally, Rosetta wasn’t the type of person who would ask for a ‘favor’ in all her life.</p>
<p>And in the end, what’s rare was bound to become a weapon on her side.</p>
<p>“Favor? You’re… asking me a favor?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Is… Is that alright?”</p>
<p>When asked if she could, he nodded hastily.</p>
<p>“Of course. Just say the word.”</p>
<p>It was still a rather rigid tone, but he was speaking faster than usual.</p>
<p>Rosetta laughed inwardly.</p>
<p>‘Just say the word?’</p>
<p>That was such a dangerous thing to utter. How could he spew out such words so quickly?</p>
<p>With an awkward smile on her lips, Rosetta replied.</p>
<p>“If that’s so… There’s a lot of eyes here, so let’s talk outside please.”</p>
<p>“Ah, right. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Gladly, Damian opened the door and went out first.</p>
<p>After checking Cassion first as he was sleeping, Rosetta followed behind Damian.</p>
<p>Alicia also tried to follow, but only until there. Rosetta sent her a sign not to follow.</p>
<p>Alicia stopped in her tracks, looking worried instead of disappointed.</p>
<p>In Rosetta’s perspective, it wasn’t like she was in any danger, but it was exactly that in Alicia’s eyes.</p>
<p>‘It’s alright.’</p>
<p>Rosetta turned her head slightly and mouthed the words towards Alicia.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it didn’t seem to work.</p>
<p>Eventually, Rosetta and Damian went into a drawing room that wasn’t far from the guest room.</p>
<p>As soon as a maid served tea, Damian dismissed them all from the room.</p>
<p>It was a signal for Rosetta to talk comfortably.</p>
<p>Damian had a rigid expression on his face right now, but in his golden eyes, there was a glimmer of weakness.</p>
<p>It seemed like a strong sign of him agreeing to the favor Rosetta would ask of him.</p>
<p>Even if he couldn’t treat her like family or worry for her as a brother, was he going to do this favor just to relieve his guilt?</p>
<p>“Don’t worry anymore, Rosetta. Just tell me what you need.”</p>
<p>As if hesitating, his voice trembled slightly, and he opened the door to this discussion first.</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded, pretending to be encouraged by his words.</p>
<p>And she also opened her lips.</p>
<p>Damian’s expression started to become darker in an instant.</p>
<p>Because the request Rosetta was asking of him wasn’t exactly easy.</p>
<p>“Brother, I want to hire him as my escort knight.”</p>
<p>And there followed a heavy silence.</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>Within that stagnant silence, he spoke slowly.</p>
<p>Damian’s expression had a slight distortion.</p>
<p>The quiet voice that called back seemed to express both the difficulty and the absurdity he was feeling.</p>
<p>Well, it was understandable.</p>
<p>Would it be commonplace to give a stranger a job in a noble household just because he saved her once?</p>
<p>In addition, it wasn’t just a regular job, but a position as an ‘escort knight’.</p>
<p>Rosetta knew him well.</p>
<p>If she were in Damian’s shoes, she also wouldn’t have liked this situation.</p>
<p>However, that was none of her concern.</p>
<p>All she was concerned with now was to get Cassion into this house.</p>
<p>“Then, you want that man as your escort knight?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>At the firm answer that held no reservations, mixed feelings passed through Damian’s expression.</p>
<p>“Actually, that person… He’s someone I know.”</p>
<p>“You know each other?”</p>
<p>“Yes. When I was younger, I mean before I came to the Duchy, he was a childhood friend who often played with me. After that, we only exchanged letters once in a while.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Fortunately, Damian didn’t seem to be suspicious of this. Indeed, what was there to suspect?</p>
<p>If there was something he doubted right away, it would be under the premise that she was lying.</p>
<p>But at the moment, the thought that ‘Rosetta is lying’ was an assumption that he would forcefully suppress.</p>
<p>At best, he would suspect Cassion and have him investigated later.</p>
<p>‘I left it to Blanca, so there won’t be a problem.’</p>
<p>In the first place, this was the script that Blanca had written, so there was nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>With trembling eyelashes, Rosetta reached towards the elegant white teacup, steam rising from it.</p>
<p>But as she reached out, her hand paused in the air and she brought it back down over her lap.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I was lonely sometimes. I… I actually know everything. Brother and Father are uncomfortable with me.”</p>
<p>As she uttered these words in a subdued tone, the gaze that was on her fluctuated slightly.</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly as she heard the answer that only mentioned her name. Then, she continued speaking in a calm manner.</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I’ve put it behind me. It’s not Brother or Father’s fault, but still, I’m really sorry.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I just brought this up because I wanted to tell you that he was the only friend who cheered me up when I was so lonely. His letters that arrived once in a while were my salvation.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 33</p>
<p>Truthfully, it wouldn’t have been easy for a commoner’s letter to pass through the walls of a Duke’s estate.</p>
<p>Well in the first place, no one would think that it’s believable that the correspondent was a noble, too.</p>
<p>However, Damian didn’t seem to have any plans of pointing out the discrepancies here.</p>
<p>This was also a result of the ‘forced trust’ he had brainwashed himself with.</p>
<p>‘I won’t doubt Rosetta. That’s why Rosetta’s words do not hold any lies.’</p>
<p>So it was the same as forced trust.</p>
<p>Either way, this was something good for Rosetta.</p>
<p>‘How did you exchange letters?’ —If she were to be asked a question like this, she had prepared answers in advance, but the more excuses she made, the more suspicion would be thrown at her.</p>
<p>So it was much better not to be doubted from the very start.</p>
<p>“It was like that. And the incident with Katie made me miss him for no reason. He’s the only one who lifted me up, the only one who comforted me from loneliness. Actually, that’s why I went out. Maxwell… No, my friend. I wanted to see him. I’m just so very exhausted.”</p>
<p>The voice eventually trailed off, followed soon by silence. When she glanced at Damian, whose expression was very dark, he was looking at Rosetta.</p>
<p>He stared at her for a long time, then he swept his face with a large hand. After which, he opened his lips and spoke with great difficulty.</p>
<p>“…But Rosetta. That’s not enough justification for making someone your escort knight. Our family is a family of knights. There are many people who belong to the chivalric order of our family. And more than that, being an escort knight is an even more honorable position. It’s not something that could be granted just because he’s your childhood friend.”</p>
<p>Lying beneath his calm tone was a hint of distress.</p>
<p>As though it was painful for him just saying this.</p>
<p>Rosetta stayed silent and didn’t speak, but she slowly reached for her teacup as she looked up at him.</p>
<p>The tea inside the cup rippled along with her trembling hands.</p>
<p>“…I know. I’m asking for too much. He’s already here, but there are restrictions. Even so…”</p>
<p>Damian quietly listened to Rosetta’s words.</p>
<p>“It’s been thirteen years. Thirteen. Our nanny held Alicia and I by our throats at that time. In all those years, did anyone ever tell you about it, Brother?”</p>
<p>There was no answer.</p>
<p>There was nothing to answer. No one ever told him the truth.</p>
<p>Among the servants in the detached building, those who worked near me and Alicia were all in the same league as Marie.</p>
<p>They stuck to Katie’s side, satisfied with the crumbs coming their way.</p>
<p>‘Come to think of it, I haven’t seen Marie.’</p>
<p>She wondered for a moment, but it ended there. Marie wasn’t important right now.</p>
<p>Clearing her dry throat for a moment, she opened her lips to speak again.</p>
<p>“It’s so suffocating. It really feels like I was being strangled. The fact that people hide their terrible innermost thoughts with smiling faces… it makes me feel sick and nauseous.”</p>
<p>Her tone was a cross between anger and sadness.</p>
<p>No, it only sounded like that. Rosetta paused for a moment as she took in a short breath.</p>
<p>“Compared to them, Maxwell saved me without any hesitation. He threw himself for a childhood friend who he only exchanged letters with a few times. When I saw this, to be honest… I was happy. I was happy to know that there’s someone who could do something like that for me. In a world where I don’t know who I should trust, it finally felt like there was someone I can rely on here by my side.”</p>
<p>She placed her hands on the table.</p>
<p>As her trembling fingertips touched the teacup, the small clatter permeated the air.</p>
<p>Damian tightened his lips together, but he still wouldn’t reply.</p>
<p>“Since he earned some money from mercenary work, I thought that he wouldn’t be so bad with a sword. That’s why…”</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>“…Maxwell is a genuine friend. He makes me feel like I can breathe. Brother, please… You said you’d grant me a favor. This is my only wish.”</p>
<p>As her plea grew longer, Damian bit his lower lip strongly.</p>
<p>From this point on—the moment he considered this forced trust, the moment of strife, it could be said that it’s in the bag.</p>
<p>‘Bringing in a commoner friend for a ducal princess of ambiguous parentage?’</p>
<p>Truthfully, it wasn’t something that could be easily pulled off.</p>
<p>Rather than just his appointment as a knight, there were more things that should be given attention to, such as other people’s opinions and the inevitable complaints and contempt of the other knights.</p>
<p>It would have been easier to keep him in the mansion as a ‘servant’ or an ‘attendant’.</p>
<p>Right now, if Rosetta’s request to make him an ‘escort knight’ was to be approved, then it would be a cause for celebration in her case.</p>
<p>Even so, despite being aware of the facts, Rosetta had to make him an escort knight.</p>
<p>Regardless of what would happen, it wouldn’t raise eyebrows if they were seen together, and communication even within the mansion was possible for them.</p>
<p>This was the only position that would make sense for other people’s eyes.</p>
<p>In addition, if a knight other than him would follow Rosetta around, then her movements would be limited.</p>
<p>Instead of marching forward yet doubling back again, it was better to solve problems straight away when it was right in front of you.</p>
<p>If she were to be stuck with someone who couldn’t be trusted, then she would have to hide more things, and inevitably, there would be more restrictions on her.</p>
<p>That’s why she was trying to make Cassion her escort knight, even if it was difficult to achieve.</p>
<p>Once again, it wasn’t something that could be easily pulled off.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t entirely impossible.</p>
<p>There was very little that a rich and powerful individual couldn’t do if they would insist on it.</p>
<p>If there was something they couldn’t do, then it could be that they lacked their own money and power.</p>
<p>This is how this dirty world goes round.</p>
<p>It was like this as well in modern times, where corruption and nepotism—based on which school you went to, which region you’re part of and which relatives you had—were rampant.</p>
<p>If you can point a finger at it, you can just buy it off.</p>
<p>A pronounced silence weighed heavily in the air.</p>
<p>Within that stifled room, even the sound of breathing disappeared.</p>
<p>The cold air finally broke as Damian sighed briefly.</p>
<p>Behind that sigh, he closed his eyes tightly.</p>
<p>After a while, his eyes opened and his gaze went straight towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>It was a sign that he had decided.</p>
<p>With a hint of trepidation, Rosetta met his gaze.</p>
<p>“First of all… I understand.”</p>
<p>It was a slow, but affirmative answer.</p>
<p>He seemed to wish he could express his qualms about it right away, but in the end, it was a positive answer that he uttered.</p>
<p>And Rosetta nodded right then, fearing that he would change his mind quickly.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“…Instead, the final decision will be given after that man wakes up. But just in case, we’ll have to check his identity and listen to his intentions.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Brother. Please go ahead.”</p>
<p>At this point, Rosetta thought that their conversation was already done.</p>
<p>Damian reached towards his teacup and sipped his lukewarm tea. So to match him, Rosetta sipped her own cup.</p>
<p>However, Damian continued to sit there even though his cup was now empty.</p>
<p>Should Rosetta hint at him to leave? By the time she thought about it, Damian opened his lips again.</p>
<p>“But there’s a condition.”</p>
<p>…You should have said this sooner.</p>
<p>There was no reason to lift someone up only to drop them back down on the ground again.</p>
<p>‘Ah, life isn’t easy.’</p>
<p>Fatigue was setting in. Anyway, she already knew that nothing would go that smoothly.</p>
<p>Cassion ran away and returned. Blanca was testing her. Damian was talking about a condition.</p>
<p>Suddenly, it felt like her life was filled with too many ups and downs. And as she tried to hide this, Rosetta closed her eyes as she asked.</p>
<p>“A condition?”</p>
<p>“Yes, a condition.”</p>
<p>He gave a firm response.</p>
<p>As if he wouldn’t back down no matter what.</p>
<p>Right. Rosetta thought that it was inevitable that a condition would be attached to this to some extent for him to accept this ridiculous request.</p>
<p>Instead of answering, Rosetta only nodded.</p>
<p>And Damian’s lips opened slowly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After their conversation, Rosetta and Damian separated in the hallway and went their own ways.</p>
<p>Damian headed towards the main mansion whereas Rosetta returned to where she had just been.</p>
<p>On the way, Rosetta encountered Alicia in the corridor.</p>
<p>And it was clear that she was waiting for Rosetta.</p>
<p>Not Damian. Rosetta. She waited for Rosetta. It was a strange feeling.</p>
<p>But Rosetta was certain that it didn’t feel terrible.</p>
<p>If asked if she was fine, then she would answer she was fine.</p>
<p>But it seemed as if Alicia was going to scold Rosetta.</p>
<p>Or, it felt like she was going to force Rosetta to tell her what happened.</p>
<p>Alicia asked Rosetta to have dinner with her later, and Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>They then separated there at the hallway, and Rosetta headed straight to the guest room where Cassion was.</p>
<p>She stood outside the room for a moment to listen in, but the room was quiet.</p>
<p>Both the maids and the doctor, who were busy going in and out of the room, seemed to have left.</p>
<p>She raised a hand to knock, but she thought against it and just opened the door.</p>
<p>Entering the room that was dead silent, she saw Cassion sleeping there.</p>
<p>Right now, it was just before sunset.</p>
<p>Under the dim sunlight, she could see his finely closed eyelids.</p>
<p>And as she listened to his even breathing, she couldn’t tell if he was really sleeping or just pretending to sleep.</p>
<p>Before arriving at the mansion, he swallowed a very well made sleeping pill that would render him unconscious for the story of him ‘collapsing after rolling down a flight of stairs’ look believable.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, he fell asleep without any problems earlier.</p>
<p>But was he awake now? Or was he still asleep?</p>
<p>Strangely, as Rosetta looked at the sleeping Cassion, she didn’t want to wake him.</p>
<p>Was it because exhaustion, sadness and suffering had finally set in on this day?</p>
<p>Or was it because the still silence seemed to give him serenity?</p>
<p>‘…I have to tell him about the condition to become my escort knight.’</p>
<p>She thought about it for a moment as she leaned back against the door, but she soon walked forward slowly towards the bed.</p>
<p>With a stream of sunlight on his face, a long shadow stretched under his thick eyelashes.</p>
<p>‘What is this. He’s pointlessly handsome.’</p>
<p>She was amazed yet again.</p>
<p>Under the sun that shone on him like a spotlight, he looked exactly like a porcelain doll.</p>
<p>It was a shame that he covered his eyes with his long hair before, but at least, if he had shown his face more back then, then they would have had a lot of problems deceiving people about his identity.</p>
<p>In the first place, this was a face that would be imprinted on people’s minds at just one look.</p>
<p>She stared at Cassion, who at first glance looked serene yet at the same time uncomfortable, then quietly closed the curtains and left the room.</p>
<p>Ka-chak.</p>
<p>The sound of the door closing resonated along the hallway.</p>
<p>This time, she leaned against the door once more. Unlike inside the room, the surface that touched her back this time was cold.</p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it, there’s no need to talk now.’</p>
<p>Anyway, it was only during the night that there wouldn’t be many servants wandering around the place, so there was someone she’d have to meet tonight.</p>
<p>By the end of her conversation with that person, Cassion would wake up from his nap.</p>
<p>Nodding slightly, Rosetta stood up straight. Unlike before, when people were busy coming and going through the corridors, it was now quiet.</p>
<p>To the extent that the sound of her footsteps echoed.</p>
<p>The cool air blew by her ankles as she passed through the hallway.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Rosetta’s footsteps could be heard through the door.</p>
<p>The lithe, elegant footsteps resounded in the room where only breathing sounds permeated.</p>
<p>By the time the footsteps faded away, the man’s eyelids opened slowly.</p>
<p>The sunlight that had poured over his face had since disappeared, and a curtain of shadow was instead cast over him.</p>
<p>Maxwell. Or, Cassion.</p>
<p>The man with two names stared at the ceiling with eyes that were as black as ink.</p>
<p>It felt like the scent of roses lingered at the tip of his nose.</p>
<p>And somehow, that scent made it difficult for him to open his closed eyes.</p>
<p>Rosetta.</p>
<p>It was Rosetta’s scent.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 34</p>
<p>With her eyes closed, Rosetta breathed out.</p>
<p>In that dark world, the breath that expanded her lungs made her stomach tense.</p>
<p>As she breathed comfortably, she felt that her mind and body were becoming more organized.</p>
<p>Originally, controlling one’s qi had to be done through constant practice through time.</p>
<p>In addition, Rosetta’s body had yet to adapt to this strength, so she’d have to do this more often…</p>
<p>Anyway, it had been far too hectic these days, so this was the first time she had time alone. The amount of qi that she could use had gradually increased.</p>
<p>‘I think it’d be better if I could practice in a separate closed building.’</p>
<p>However, she gave up that thought quickly because it wasn’t the right time for it, and it’d be like saying, ‘I came out of a cave and it’s already been years’.</p>
<p>Until Cassion became stronger, she would have to play the role of protecting him.</p>
<p>The ideal scenario was that there’d be no one who could figure out who he was, but secrets were secrets in the end. They could be revealed.</p>
<p>If so, then the other side would be tenacious about getting rid of Cassion.</p>
<p>Then in the end, Rosetta will have to be the one to step up to the plate.</p>
<p>Cassion would likely be strong eventually, but his growth would take some time to build.</p>
<p>She would have to protect this sprout so that it wouldn’t be trampled on. He should grow up well enough so that he could go against the male lead.</p>
<p>And there would be other requirements for that to happen.</p>
<p>The things that a person would need to climb to the top.</p>
<p>Money. People. Power.</p>
<p>Just as you can make a wish in Drag*n Ball after collecting them, all three of these requirements would make Cassion a Duke.</p>
<p>It would be difficult to attract people without money. It would become difficult to gain power without the support of people. And nothing could be done without power.</p>
<p>And just as with Madam Blanca, Rosetta would be able to get what she needed by using knowledge of the original novel properly.</p>
<p>The coming-of-age ball.</p>
<p>That was the D-day.</p>
<p>The health of the current Duke Carter would decline starting the coming-of-age ball.</p>
<p>So until that day, Rosetta would need to gather the necessary requisites one by one so that Cassion could stand tall in front of those people.</p>
<p>‘There’s much work to be done.’</p>
<p>Only one step had been taken.</p>
<p>Somehow, the time she had dedicated to training her mind was invaded by many different thoughts. This was why she couldn’t do it.</p>
<p>With no other choice, she exhaled and stopped the directed flow of qi. She couldn’t stop thinking, so she was forced to stop training.</p>
<p>When she stopped the repeated deep breathing, the anguish that she had been suppressing this whole time came like a lightning bolt.</p>
<p>Among them, the biggest anguish was regret.</p>
<p>‘Ah, my mind’s a mess.’</p>
<p>She just wanted to live a long, peaceful life.</p>
<p>Just now, she was thinking about her plan to make Cassion the next Duke, but now she was tasting some regret.</p>
<p>It would have been better to live without being tied up like this. She wasn’t even the main character here.</p>
<p>She could have lived a comfortable life if she didn’t get involved in the first place.</p>
<p>A determined resolution she made barely a week ago belatedly ended up as a source of regret.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t just regret that came in hindsight. Regrets, then afterward, something else hanging in the back.</p>
<p>Ultimately, in the end.</p>
<p>The memories that wouldn’t let her give up on these annoying things to be done.</p>
<p>’I don’t want to live like this, Sister.’</p>
<p>Suddenly, Alicia’s voice from her dream rang behind her ears. And what flashed in her mind were those empty eyes that she couldn’t forget.</p>
<p>And an expression that seemed to say, ‘Save me.’</p>
<p>That’s right. A face that looks like Rita.</p>
<p>Now, Rosetta jumped into this troublesome task to get rid of such a future.</p>
<p>The only thing one who could change Alicia’s fate was Rosetta as she knew how the original plot would go.</p>
<p>And the small kindness that Rosetta showed had already changed Alicia.</p>
<p>Even if it was an insignificant act, it grew like a tempest borne out of a butterfly’s wings.</p>
<p>Could anyone be able to stop a storm that had already begun?</p>
<p>Soon, Rosetta opened her eyes slowly.</p>
<p>The world, which had looked dark, gradually became brighter and clearer.</p>
<p>She stood up as slowly as she breathed in and out.</p>
<p>Glancing at the clock, she saw that it was already close to the time she promised to meet Alicia.</p>
<p>If she was late, Alicia might shed tears and look like a swollen dumpling again, so Rosetta made sure to be there on time.</p>
<p>‘But that’s cute too, so it should be alright.’</p>
<p>She had been sitting on the floor, so her dress was crumpled. After patting it down twice, she started for the door, but she stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p>This reminds her. There’s something she had to check in advance.</p>
<p>She turned back from the door and went towards the walk-in closet. It was a space filled to the brim with clothes.</p>
<p>There were dark clothes that she didn’t really wear, but there was something else she found.</p>
<p>A black cloak with a hood.</p>
<p>It was the same kind of cloak that she wore when she saved Cassion.</p>
<p>Long, dark. It was the ideal piece of clothing to hide in the dark.</p>
<p>In other words, it was the perfect outfit to wear when meeting someone at night.</p>
<p>’No, no please! Lady Rosetta! Rosetta! Please come here! I have something to tell you! Milady I’m— You must come to see me! Milady! You’ll regret it if you don’t come, you’ll regret it!’</p>
<p>Katie.</p>
<p>Wasn’t she waiting for Rosetta in that dark dungeon?</p>
<p>Even in a place like this, there’s a lot of paperwork to be done before someone could be executed legally.</p>
<p>Especially when the head of the household wasn’t here to do so.</p>
<p>Currently, the father of the three children, the Duke of Valentine, had left for the capital due to some important matter.</p>
<p>Therefore, all the preparations for the execution of Katie, a malicious criminal, were up to Damian.</p>
<p>It was all thanks to bureaucracy that Katie was still alive so far.</p>
<p>But once all those processes were dealt with, Katie’s life would disappear, without even the chance to plead for life imprisonment instead.</p>
<p>So Rosetta had to meet her before that.</p>
<p>All the paperwork could be finished tomorrow right away, so she had to meet Katie today.</p>
<p>What kind of great secret did she have in store?</p>
<p>A slight curiosity arose.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Sister, can I ask you about him? I’m just curious. What kind of man is he that you’d want him as an escort knight?”</p>
<p>Along with the sound of clattering cutlery, Alicia carefully asked.</p>
<p>There was a great deal of expectation from the eyes focused on Rosetta.</p>
<p>After chewing her food lightly, Rosetta answered.</p>
<p>“His name is Maxwell.”</p>
<p>And Alicia echoed the name, “Maxwell…”</p>
<p>Still, the eye-sparkling curiosity didn’t disappear.</p>
<p>Alicia blinked her big doe eyes and asked again.</p>
<p>“Are you close?”</p>
<p>Not minding propriety, she asked straightforwardly.</p>
<p>Her hands that were cutting her steak stopped. Then Rosetta stared back at Alicia.</p>
<p>“Alicia, eat the food that’s on your plate first. It’s going to get cold.”</p>
<p>Rosetta diligently ate her own food, whereas Alicia’s food didn’t decrease as she continued asking questions with shining eyes.</p>
<p>There was a fork and knife in her hands, too, but she showed no intention to eat.</p>
<p>What else could be worse than eating cold steak?</p>
<p>After Rosetta pointed this out, Alicia’s cheeks turned red. With a small nod, she soon moved her hands and took a bite for her to chew.</p>
<p>Only when she saw that Alicia was chewing her food did Rosetta speak.</p>
<p>“He’s my childhood friend. I’ve known him for a long time, long before I entered this household, and we somehow stayed in touch through a few letters between us. It’s been a while since we met, but as soon as we did, he fell down a flight of stairs to save me. Even in this world where you don’t know who to trust, I want to trust him as my escort knight because there are very few who I believe in.”</p>
<p>“…Oh my gosh……”</p>
<p>Alicia hurriedly chewed her food and said this.</p>
<p>She might think that what Rosetta and Maxwell had was a relationship that could only be seen in novels.</p>
<p>Reality was nothing but a tragedy.</p>
<p>However, Rosetta’s expectations weren’t met. In a good way.</p>
<p>Soon after, Alicia’s smooth forehead began to have shallow wrinkles.</p>
<p>Then, her round shoulders drooped while she bowed her head slightly down.</p>
<p>Obviously, it was an expression of disappointment or concern.</p>
<p>“Alicia?”</p>
<p>At the call of her name, Alicia bit her lower lip.</p>
<p>Rosetta waited for Alicia to say something, observing her sudden change in demeanor.</p>
<p>The lips that were bitten by her white teeth eventually opened.</p>
<p>“…Then, Sister… With… Maxwell, you must be close to him, right? More so… than with me…”</p>
<p>As she spoke more, her voice gradually became smaller and smaller, and her pronunciation became less clear.</p>
<p>Even though the mumbled words sounded like gibberish by the end, Rosetta still understood.</p>
<p>She stared at Alicia for a moment.</p>
<p>Those honey-like eyes that glistened in the summer sun were filled with frustration.</p>
<p>“…Goodness.”</p>
<p>With a short laugh, Rosetta let out a sigh.</p>
<p>Indeed. This was very much an Alicia-like response. The fact that Alicia didn’t even doubt her somehow made her feel bitter.</p>
<p>Out of the blue, she thought of Cassion.</p>
<p>When he was in danger in that alley.</p>
<p>When she asked him, “Should I help you?’ he couldn’t answer because he was worried that Rosetta would get hurt.</p>
<p>Both Alicia and Cassion were so very alike. They both went beyond Rosetta’s expectations.</p>
<p>When Rosetta had burst into laughter, Alicia suddenly looked resentful.</p>
<p>“Why are you laughing! I’m serious. I like Sister a lot, but Sister might not feel the same way. Besides, someone you trust… I… I don’t know if you also consider me to be one…”</p>
<p>She was still murmuring, but she spoke a little louder than before. Though the area around her eyes started to become red.</p>
<p>Rosetta tried to rein in the laughter bubbling up. With only a slight smile on her lips, she made eye contact with the other person who seemed to be on the brink of sobbing at any moment.</p>
<p>“I like you more. And I trust you. You don’t have to ask that.”</p>
<p>“…Sister.”</p>
<p>Eventually, Alicia reached up to cover her eyes with both hands.</p>
<p>As she tried to hide her face behind her hands, Rosetta eventually laughed out loud.</p>
<p>It was a pleasant dinner.</p>
<p>Rosetta didn’t even know how long it had been since she had such a peaceful meal.</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, she had been trapped in a cold cage, eating alone as a man watched her closely.</p>
<p>When she suddenly recalled this, Rosetta stopped laughing.</p>
<p>Right. It can’t be like that for Alicia. With Alicia being Alicia, such a future didn’t suit her.</p>
<p>And so for a while, Rosetta thought that she would have any useless regrets.</p>
<p>Clatter.</p>
<p>She chewed a cold piece of steak as the sound of cutlery followed.</p>
<p>The taste was somewhat miserly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 35</p>
<p>The mansion during the dark evening was incomparably quiet compared to the mansion during the day.</p>
<p>There were no lights in several places, but there was a pressing atmosphere that couldn’t be ignored.</p>
<p>Rosetta walked under the covers of the shadows wearing a cloak with its hood over her head.</p>
<p>The place she arrived at was in front of the door leading to the dungeon.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Katie wasn’t the only one currently imprisoned, so security wasn’t so strict. Guards would only sometimes go on patrols.</p>
<p>The other servants who were under suspicion were detained and questioned in their respective quarters because their crimes have yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>Still, just in case, Rosetta pressed her back against the wall and looked around, but she felt no signs of other people’s presence.</p>
<p>After confirming that the hallway was silent, she opened the door leading to the dungeon without hesitation.</p>
<p>The Valentine residence was a fairly old mansion. It was well-maintained so its age wasn’t too apparent, but inside the dungeon, the mansion’s ancientness was palpable.</p>
<p>In a residence laced with old history, there had been many sinners.</p>
<p>As she descended the stairs and opened the door of the dungeon, the metallic smell of blood reached her nose right then. The humid air that wrapped around her body was sodden and unpleasant.</p>
<p>It was the perfect place for sinners.</p>
<p>Whenever she took a step, the sound over the damp ground echoed.</p>
<p>Then, as that sound would reverberate over the rusty bars of empty cells, it echoed even further.</p>
<p>Rosetta walked leisurely as if she were admiring the space, the echoing sounds as her background music.</p>
<p>Right now, all cells were empty except for where Katie was staying. But soon, this place would become full.</p>
<p>‘Ah, I wonder which cell would suit our poor Marie.’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Damian and Rosetta finished their conversation earlier—</p>
<p>He was about to leave through the door, but he stopped for a moment and looked back at her.</p>
<p>“Rosetta.”</p>
<p>“Yes…?”</p>
<p>The answer she gave was almost a question. Was there anything else to be said between them?</p>
<p>She even felt anxious for no reason.</p>
<p>This time, she was afraid that he would add more conditions.</p>
<p>Fortunately however, that wasn’t why he called her.</p>
<p>“Do you feel awkward with the servants in the annex?”</p>
<p>It was uncomfortable, but at the question, Rosetta recalled Marie, who she hadn’t seen in a while.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it wasn’t just Marie.</p>
<p>She didn’t know all the servants of the annex, but there were some people she knew by their faces.</p>
<p>But all the servants she met today were strangers.</p>
<p>Those maids and attendants rushed to take care of me and the unconscious Cassion after we had returned.</p>
<p>All of them.</p>
<p>‘No way… Already? Did he change them?’</p>
<p>This situation was something she also anticipated, and it was the same ‘personnel change’ she told the coachman about.</p>
<p>However, she just didn’t know that it would happen so soon, in just mere days while she was away.</p>
<p>Ah, it would be difficult at this rate.</p>
<p>‘Personnel change’ season. There was also something she had to do during the recruitment announcement period for new servants.</p>
<p>While lost in thought, Damian added.</p>
<p>“All the servants of the annex are under investigation. Earlier… As you said, it’s impossible that all those people knew nothing about what was happening for all those thirteen years. I’m sure some of them were complicit in it. Or perhaps all of them.”</p>
<p>“Have they been imprisoned?”</p>
<p>“No. Unlike Katie who was caught in the act, they’re being detained in the servants quarters because their innocence or guilt needs to be determined. Right now, the servants in the annex have been sent from the central mansion to make up for the lack of personnel, but this might give you inconveniences. I’ll hire new servants within the month, so please bear with it for a while.”</p>
<p>Rosetta swallowed her sigh of relief. Fortunately, those who were currently working in the annex were recruited from the central mansion.</p>
<p>Both the central mansion and the annex couldn’t be lacking servants, so it could be expected that a large-scale job posting would soon appear, just as Rosetta had anticipated.</p>
<p>“Then will the innocent servants return to the annex after the investigation?”</p>
<p>“No. I’ll have them sent to work elsewhere with letters of recommendation. If you have to see their familiar faces arbitrarily, you may feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>Now that he mentioned it, Rosetta was actually fine, but Alicia might feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Even now, like a tree with thin branches, she was a child whose shoulders would tremble.</p>
<p>Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your consideration.</p>
<p>“…It’s not something you should be grateful about. This all happened because I hadn’t been taking care of you properly.”</p>
<p>The soft, weak voice sounded very bitter.</p>
<p>When their eyes met, it was Damian who averted his gaze first. There was a sense of bitterness and repentance in the way he avoided Rosetta’s eyes.</p>
<p>She stared at him for a moment, then she opened her lips to speak quietly.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to apologize. Rather than me, it was Alicia who suffered more.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying…”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s calm remark, Damian looked at her with wide eyes.</p>
<p>She shrugged and continued to speak calmly.</p>
<p>“You know what I mean. For me, it’s enough that you listened to my wishes today, Brother. So you don’t have to pay any more attention to me. If you take more care of Alicia, then that would be enough.”</p>
<p>Right. Rosetta just wanted him to focus on Alicia instead with the time he was spending to focus on her.</p>
<p>All she wanted was money and a few favors.</p>
<p>She didn’t want any other thing.</p>
<p>She then curtsied towards Damian, who was frozen like a stone. Then, she passed by him and approached the door.</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>But as soon as she was about to open the door, Damian grabbed her arm.</p>
<p>Both of them were stuck in front of the door now.</p>
<p>“Do you have something more to say?”</p>
<p>His lips fluttered open and close.</p>
<p>He wanted to say something, but it seemed like he couldn’t dare to.</p>
<p>The lips, which had been opening and closing for a while, ended up being drawn into a straight line.</p>
<p>It was a little later that his voice came out again.</p>
<p>After his lips closed, the emotions on his face were now hidden. Perhaps what he was saying now was not what he originally wanted to say.</p>
<p>However, Rosetta was not curious about what that was.</p>
<p>“Among the servants under suspicion, both your and Alicia’s exclusive maids insisted that they weren’t complicit. They said they didn’t know anything and that you’d vouch for their innocence. Do you know what they’re talking about?”</p>
<p>Rosetta recalled those two people, their eyes filled with anxiety.</p>
<p>Honestly, saying that they were innocent was ridiculous.</p>
<p>The two people who had been with Rosetta and Alicia for the longest period of time never once doubted Katie?</p>
<p>Who would believe that.</p>
<p>Damian also felt that way.</p>
<p>He didn’t believe in their innocence at all, but they consistently shouted precocious things like that, and it felt like they threw out Rosetta’s name just in case.</p>
<p>Perhaps dear Marie and Alicia’s maid who Rosetta didn’t know thought that Rosetta would actually vouch for their innocence. Like a fool.</p>
<p>She said she’d let Marie live, not let her avoid her sins.</p>
<p>And did Marie really think that Rosetta would keep a promise like that when it was the maid who had been deceiving her for seven years?</p>
<p>If Marie had been deceiving people like that so far, she should know that she could be deceived in return.</p>
<p>Whatever she and the other maid said anyway, there was no more power or credibility in their words.</p>
<p>There was nothing to reveal, and even if they said they were threatened into doing it, what they say would be ignored.</p>
<p>‘Try barking as hard as you can.’</p>
<p>Even so, no one would understand a beast’s roars.</p>
<p>Rosetta shook her head.</p>
<p>And she smiled.</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know what they mean by those words.”</p>
<p>“Right, I got it. You should rest now.”</p>
<p>The voice that answered late was like a frosty wind in the middle of winter.</p>
<p>As he was deep in thought, Rosetta was reminded that he was the heir of a knight’s family, and so those thoughts must be ruthless and cold.</p>
<p>‘I think those empty prison cells will soon be filled with many people.’</p>
<p>Once again, Rosetta smiled brightly and curtsied. Then, she left the room.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Recalling what happened earlier, Rosetta looked for a suitable cell for Marie where she would stay for a long time, but she suddenly heard someone’s voice.</p>
<p>“Is… Is someone there?”</p>
<p>The voice of a woman who was about fifty years old.</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t difficult to figure out whose voice this was.</p>
<p>Well, there’s only one person imprisoned here in the first place.</p>
<p>Katie.</p>
<p>With heavier steps, Rosetta walked towards that direction.</p>
<p>Splash.</p>
<p>Hearing the loud footsteps over the sodden ground, Katie suddenly raised her voice and began to shout.</p>
<p>“Ahh, please… Please save me! I’m innocent! This is unfair! Please go and call Lady Rosetta! Please! The Lady, call Lady Rosetta! I’m innocent I say!”</p>
<p>How desperate were those pleas?</p>
<p>If anyone heard her, they’d think she’s really innocent.</p>
<p>‘Innocent? Ridiculous.’</p>
<p>She was shameless, too.</p>
<p>Why were criminals so shameless?</p>
<p>From the past and the present. In the future, in modern times. In internet novels, in martial arts novels, in romance fantasies.</p>
<p>Everywhere she went, this was an inflexible truth.</p>
<p>Several days had already passed, but Katie still seemed to be clamoring that she was not guilty.</p>
<p>However, there were still some opportunities left until the date of her execution was confirmed.</p>
<p>So even with those few days left, she was trying to struggle and survive.</p>
<p>Rosetta walked with a smile on her face, and she reached the source of the loud sound.</p>
<p>She turned around and crouched down, looking into the cell.</p>
<p>It seemed as though Katie had yet to notice that someone had arrived in front of her.</p>
<p>Rosetta didn’t care, but she couldn’t help but notice how she was screaming with her hands wrapped around her face, her neck torn with gashes.</p>
<p>She set the lamp down on the floor and tapped an iron bar with one finger.</p>
<p>Only then did the loud shouts in the dungeon stop.</p>
<p>I’m innocent… nocent… cent…</p>
<p>Her last cry echoed silently.</p>
<p>Katie lowered her hand and hurriedly raised her head.</p>
<p>The face Rosetta saw was terrible.</p>
<p>It looked like Katie suffered a lot during the few days and nights she was here, but his cheeks were gaunt and the circles underneath her eyes were deep and thick.</p>
<p>She had shed so much tears that the area around her eyes was all red.</p>
<p>Wiping her eyes as though she couldn’t believe what she was seeing, Katie soon realized who was in front of her. Then, she visibly brightened up.</p>
<p>Katie crawled on the ground as if she was a lost dog that had found its owner. She came closer to the iron bars.</p>
<p>Rattle, screech.</p>
<p>The chains attached to her limbs made a rattling sound as they grazed the floor.</p>
<p>“Mi…Milady!”</p>
<p>“You look well. I guess you’re born to be thrown into prison.”</p>
<p>With these twisted words uttered, the corners of her raised lips flinched. However, Katie continued to smile. Then, she spoke.</p>
<p>“No… No of course not, Milady. I’m so glad you’re here Milady.”</p>
<p>Rosetta was curious now. What big revelation was Katie going to tell?</p>
<p>Katie must be holding some faith in this secret, that’s why she was welcoming Rosetta like this.</p>
<p>Otherwise, she wouldn’t have wanted to see the person who threw her into this place.</p>
<p>With her chin on her knee as she crouched down, Rosetta looked into Katie’s dark blue eyes.</p>
<p>“It’s good to hear that you’re happy. I’m glad to see you again, too. For you to look for me so desperately like this—I got curious about what you want to say.”</p>
<p>“It’s good that you came, Milady. You… you did well to come here.”</p>
<p>“Never mind that. Tell me what would make you become innocent. And stop yelling.”</p>
<p>With a cold smile, the atmosphere around them dropped. The corners of Rosetta’s raised lips were subtly twisted.</p>
<p>However, that was it.</p>
<p>Katie bowed even deeper and whispered to Rosetta with a voice reminiscent of a snake slithering on the ground.</p>
<p>“It’s… It’s just, Milady…”</p>
<p>As Katie looked up, Rosetta felt a strange sense of anticipation and confidence in the nanny’s gaze.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 36</p>
<p>With a weak smile, Katie groveled closer on her knees towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>As she limped, the chains attached to her legs were dragged across the ground, accompanied by a loud noise again.</p>
<p>Katie looked around the prison, then when it was clear that there was no one else there, she prostrated as low as she could.</p>
<p>Even so, there wasn’t much space for anyone to see this.</p>
<p>With a bored expression, Rosetta waited for the older woman to open her lips.</p>
<p>“Actually… I am keeping a big secret. It’s a great secret that could shake the Duchy. No actually, more than that, it’s a secret that could shake up and overturn the entire noble society because of how shocking it is.”</p>
<p>“…A secret that could shake the Duchy?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Milady. I know a secret that could turn the world upside down. If you get me out of here, if you promise me. No, no… no, it’s… If you listen to what I have to say, you won’t be able to resist getting me out of here.”</p>
<p>After saying these words, the sound of rough breathing filled the dungeon.</p>
<p>Excited by what she herself said, Katie scratched the stone floor with her blackened nails.</p>
<p>‘It doesn’t look like you’re lying.’</p>
<p>Observing how worked up she was about it, Rosetta slowly opened her lips.</p>
<p>“Are you the only one who knows this secret?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. I’m the only one.”</p>
<p>“Then how can I believe your words to be true?”</p>
<p>Despite accusingly asking this question, Katie’s smile couldn’t be erased from her face.</p>
<p>Because she was smiling too broadly, her chapped lips had cracked and started bleeding.</p>
<p>In an instant, there was a grotesque sight of blood flowing down her lips.</p>
<p>“I have proof. There’s evidence to support what I say—if you let me leave this place. I can show it to you right away. If you save me… I can prove everything.”</p>
<p>The more she whispered, the more her eyes shone.</p>
<p>‘What kind of secret could shake up the Duchy?’</p>
<p>Even when she recalled the original novel’s contents, Rosetta couldn’t think of anything.</p>
<p>But to say that it was a lie…</p>
<p>‘It looks like she’s telling the truth.’</p>
<p>While resting her head on one hand, she tapped her chin and tilted her head to the side.</p>
<p>But she didn’t have any guesses. She couldn’t even fathom what kind of secret this was when it didn’t even appear in the novel.</p>
<p>While doubting this, Katie spoke again as if in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Milady, you know. Actually…”</p>
<p>Over the gloomy air, her trembling voice resounded.</p>
<p>Clap!</p>
<p>Although the voice was stopped with a sudden clap.</p>
<p>The lips that wished to speak urgently closed because of this.</p>
<p>And the flustered eyes turned towards Rosetta.</p>
<p>Getting up from the ground, Rosetta took the lamp with her and ignored that gaze.</p>
<p>Katie’s face, which was still in shock, was lifted along with Rosetta’s movement.</p>
<p>“Mi… Milady?”</p>
<p>As the perplexed voice called out, Rosetta reached out her hand that was holding the lamp and brought it closer to the bars.</p>
<p>Grimacing at the light, Katie flinched back.</p>
<p>The chains clinked loudly and the sound echoed.</p>
<p>With an amused expression, Rosetta looked down at Katie, then soon opened her lips.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear it.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The wrinkled forehead stretched tightly, and the head that tilted to look at Rosetta fell back with a thud towards the iron bars, her eyes glaring.</p>
<p>Over the dark blue eyes that were wide open in astonishment, the lamp’s illumination quivered.</p>
<p>To the point that it couldn’t be distinguished whether it was the lamp that was shaking or her pupils.</p>
<p>“A secret that could overturn the Duchy. That only you know. If I don’t listen to you, you’ll forever be the only one who’ll know.”</p>
<p>“Milady—”</p>
<p>“When more people know a secret, that number of people would eventually grow, and the less of a secret it becomes.”</p>
<p>Wasn’t it like that?</p>
<p>If Katie told Rosetta this secret, there wouldn’t be a guarantee that she wouldn’t tell others, right?</p>
<p>A secret that could change the Duchy.</p>
<p>Knowing a grandiose thing like that was just going to be an unnecessary burden.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be easy to keep such a thing under wraps.</p>
<p>Even now, Rosetta was already carrying so much. She was already overflowing with knowledge like that.</p>
<p>And at the same time, it was a secret that didn’t appear in the novel.</p>
<p>‘Besides, I don’t know if it’s a secret that could also shake up the Carter family…’</p>
<p>What’s the point of knowing the truth when it would only be a nuisance to her plans?</p>
<p>It might potentially help knock Leo down his position, but at the same time, it also might not.</p>
<p>And especially, Katie had specifically called her for this.</p>
<p>“So I’m not going to hear you out.”</p>
<p>Strangely, it felt right that she was feeling strange about this.</p>
<p>And in the end, no matter what Katie did, Rosetta had no intention to save the former nanny.</p>
<p>Even if the Duke himself would listen to this woman and would pardon her of her sins.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was better not to listen to something that would only bother her.</p>
<p>While she was here to hear out this woman, to no avail, Rosetta thought that it would be really troublesome if a problem would arise once it was time to deal with her.</p>
<p>When Rosetta stood straight as she looked through the bars, Katie hurriedly reached out to try and hold onto the younger woman, but she failed.</p>
<p>Because there were long chains on her arms as well.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>With that harsh sound, Katie clenched her teeth, then she shouted at Rosetta, practically screaming.</p>
<p>“Mi… Milady! Don’t do this to me! You’re making a mistake right now! Huh?!”</p>
<p>Her face turned blue from shouting.</p>
<p>It seemed like the truth of the situation still hadn’t sunk into her.</p>
<p>She must have thought that Rosetta would listen to her.</p>
<p>How foolish, this arrogance.</p>
<p>She had to remember that Rosetta also had the choice to reject her suggestion.</p>
<p>Rosetta came here to play along because she was curious, but what could be done here when she didn’t feel as interested as she thought she would be?</p>
<p>With a soft smile on her lips, Rosetta spoke.</p>
<p>“I’m not going to listen, so stop being so pathetic. Just die, Katie.”</p>
<p>Even towards Rosetta herself, the voice sounded kind.</p>
<p>Amidst the quivering light, their eyes met.</p>
<p>One gaze looking up, one gaze looking down.</p>
<p>As the silence deepened, Rosetta turned around and began to walk away.</p>
<p>In the same way that she entered, the sound of her footsteps echoed throughout the dungeon.</p>
<p>Katie, who had been rendered speechless in her shock, started again and yelled violently by the time Rosetta was out of her line of sight.</p>
<p>“Rosetta! Okay, sure! You’re supposed to make your own decisions, right? But you’ll regret this eventually! You’ll regret it to the point that you’d shed blood and tears! There will definitely be a day like that!”</p>
<p>The malice-infested voice ate up the echoing footsteps and filled the space around them.</p>
<p>However, it was only that.</p>
<p>It didn’t affect Rosetta, this desperation that a person on death row was feeling.</p>
<p>And in addition—</p>
<p>She had already been so exhausted by regrets, so exhausted by crying blood and tears.</p>
<p>The curses that this sinner was eagerly spouting were already memories of the past for her.</p>
<p>However, when she was finally going to leave,</p>
<p>“Fine, get lost! Just leave. Do you think you’re the only one who could listen to what I have to say? No, by all means. If I tell this secret to that stupid b*tch, she wouldn’t be able to resist getting me out of here.”</p>
<p>In the midst of those hostile words, a terribly unpleasant phrase was mixed in.</p>
<p>Tak, Rosetta’s footsteps halted.</p>
<p>With her eyes were fixed on the door a distance away, the tip of her tongue flicked up and touched her canine.</p>
<p>A sharp sensation stimulated her nerves.</p>
<p>“Stupid b*tch…”</p>
<p>When she repeated the word that bothered her, the damp walls that echoed her voice sounded like a snake’s slithering tone.</p>
<p>‘Stupid b*tch.’</p>
<p>Who the hell was she calling that.</p>
<p>Who the hell was it that Rosetta’s mood felt this dirty.</p>
<p>And, that person she called a stupid b*tch, why could she save Katie.</p>
<p>Why was Katie so sure that Rosetta would spare her life after hearing this secret.</p>
<p>Her mind was doused with ice cold water.</p>
<p>She didn’t know why, but she felt odd.</p>
<p>It felt like she was cold, frozen iron rod tightly with her bare hands.</p>
<p>Like she couldn’t take her fingers off it or hold it properly.</p>
<p>Her own shadow, which was there in the dark, damp dungeon, was swallowing her figure.</p>
<p>The shadow that was cast under the lamp flickered dangerously, following the small flame that illuminated her.</p>
<p>Looking down at her feet, she placed the lamp on the floor and turned around.</p>
<p>She rearranged her black cloak, undoing the collar and pulling up the hood so that there would be nothing that could be held around her neck.</p>
<p>As her steps took her closer to Katie, Rosetta could hear the older woman’s harsh breathing, stemming from anger.</p>
<p>She took the same spot earlier, and before long, the gaze of the panting woman turned to her.</p>
<p>One gaze up, the other down.</p>
<p>“Ha. Now you want to try and listen to me?”</p>
<p>With ridicule mixed into her tone, she reached out and held onto the bars with both hands.</p>
<p>What first entered Rosetta’s senses was the nauseating smell of metal that poked at the tip of her nose.</p>
<p>And as she leaned down, her eyes met with the woman’s poisonous gaze.</p>
<p>They couldn’t see each other’s faces properly because Rosetta didn’t bring the lamp, but even in the dark, the loathing they felt for the other was palpable in their words.</p>
<p>Looking at her quietly, Rosetta opened her lips and spoke softly.</p>
<p>“I’m not very interested in whether your secret overturns the Duchy or shakes up the entirety of noble society. However.”</p>
<p>“…Why come back when you’re spouting such bull—”</p>
<p>“If it’s a secret that could affect the one you called a stupid b*tch, then it would be better for you to forget that secret.”</p>
<p>The chapped lips, which were scowling at an angle, opened.</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“If you shut your trap, that secret will disappear forever, right?”</p>
<p>As Rosetta said these words, silence commenced and reduced the sound around them.</p>
<p>If silence could take a form, one of them would have choked already.</p>
<p>However, it ended in one swift movement.</p>
<p>Rosetta had already grabbed Katie through her worn-out clothes.</p>
<p>“Urk.”</p>
<p>She pulled the woman towards her with the strength in her hand. The face that was helplessly dragged forward showed terror.</p>
<p>“Let… Let go of me… What… What are you… Just what the hell are you planning to do!”</p>
<p>“Yeah. What am I going to do.”</p>
<p>With a light smile, she slowly reached out with her other hand that was previously holding the cell’s bars.</p>
<p>There was the distinct smell of iron.</p>
<p>That stench. Perhaps it wasn’t the metal.</p>
<p>What was black on the bars might not be rust, but something else.</p>
<p>“St… Stop… What are you going to do to me.”</p>
<p>After Rosetta moved her other hand, Katie’s eyes trembled as much as her voice quivered.</p>
<p>Until the hand in the air touched her cheek and couldn’t be seen by her anymore.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not going to kill you right now. You can stay alive for a few more days. Here.”</p>
<p>Right. Rosetta didn’t intend to kill her.</p>
<p>If a person were to die in prison, someone else was bound to be the target of suspicion.</p>
<p>It would be useless to stir up such an incident.</p>
<p>The ducal estate was already noisy enough with one thing or another, and Rosetta was, unintentionally, always in the middle of it all.</p>
<p>This was enough commotion and attention.</p>
<p>Since Katie was going to die even if Rosetta wasn’t going to kill her anyway, why would she need to take any risks?</p>
<p>Pulling the clothes that were in her grasp, Rosetta pulled Katie’s frightened face closer.</p>
<p>“You… You… Why… What are… What are you going to do?!”</p>
<p>With a sense of urgency, the chained hands held Rosetta’s wrists.</p>
<p>But it was impossible for Katie to take them off.</p>
<p>Looking down at the shaking hands, Rosetta calmly spoke.</p>
<p>“What’s the point of knowing.”</p>
<p>“That… What…”</p>
<p>“It’s not going to happen, but if I knew, wouldn’t I just be uselessly given something to fear?”</p>
<p>At the quiet voice that spoke as though she was reading out a fairytale, Katie’s neck moved abruptly.</p>
<p>Then, after a while, the sound of a dry heave was spat out of the throat that had swallowed dryly.</p>
<p>“Rosetta… You.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“You… Are you really Rosetta?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 37</p>
<p>Was she Rosetta, the nanny asked.</p>
<p>At the unexpectedly sharp question, she rolled her eyes.</p>
<p>A peal of laughter burst out.</p>
<p>In all these years, there were only two people who had ever noticed that she was a fake, and the first one noticed because they’d been with her while she was growing up.</p>
<p>Of course, it seemed like a throwaway question, but wasn’t this interesting?</p>
<p>As Katie continued to heave, Rosetta just laughed without answering.</p>
<p>There was chaos like no other.</p>
<p>The chains jangled on the ground with a heavy sound, and the sound of gasping breaths along with airy laughter rang through the air.</p>
<p>Watching Katie heave like that for a long time, Rosetta erased her smile and moved her hands.</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>The hand touching the older woman’s cheek slowly grabbed her chin.</p>
<p>“Agh… uh… urk…”</p>
<p>Because of the tight hold on her chin, all the words that her mouth tried to spit out were crushed.</p>
<p>Even so, well… ‘Save me’ or ‘Stop this’. It was surely going to be one or the other.</p>
<p>Her eyes, which were wide open as though they’d pop out of their sockets, were shouting for help instead of her lips.</p>
<p>The older woman’s weak hands continued to grapple at Rosetta’s wrist, trying to get her hand off.</p>
<p>Whatever.</p>
<p>Agh. Uh. Urk.</p>
<p>There was a heavy sense of fear as the repeated groans ensued. Tears began to flow out of her eyes.</p>
<p>In the darkness, the tears that flowed in streams over her cheeks looked red at first glance.</p>
<p>Like tears of blood—like a curse that Katie was pouring unto Rosetta.</p>
<p>Katie’s face flinched under her grasp as though she wanted to shake her head. The firmly held face was calm only on the outside.</p>
<p>With a bitter smile, a belated answer was given.</p>
<p>“Who am I?”</p>
<p>Katie’s chin was pulled down, to the extent that the top of her head was down and the back of her neck was completely visible.</p>
<p>Then, the back of her neck was struck, at the pressure point that would prevent her from speaking.</p>
<p>And at that, after striking that spot, it was the end of their conversation.</p>
<p>Instead of screaming, Katie’s body went into a spasm as she breathed out heavily without any sound from her throat.</p>
<p>Watching the sinner fall unconscious, Rosetta clicked her tongue.</p>
<p>“People might think your tongue was cut off.”</p>
<p>When the hand that was supporting the older woman’s chin had let go, her body fell down sideways helplessly.</p>
<p>And Rosetta rose to her feet without a sound. Her long cloak fluttered on the floor.</p>
<p>After straightening her back, she left the dungeon just as silently as she entered it.</p>
<p>The lamp’s flame still shook dangerously, the shadow following behind her dancing dangerously. On that cold evening, one secret disappeared forever.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Knock, knock.</p>
<p>Leaning against the bed’s headboard and looking out the window, Cassion turned his head as he heard the small sound.</p>
<p>The door was there to block his view, but he could guess who was standing at the other side.</p>
<p>Because there was only one person he was waiting for.</p>
<p>Creak.</p>
<p>Even without an answer to the knock, the door opened. In the first place, the person on the other side didn’t intend to wait for an answer.</p>
<p>Their eyes met.</p>
<p>Holding a lamp, Rosetta looked at him quietly. Then, she took one step through the door.</p>
<p>Between the room and the hallway.</p>
<p>She stood still in that ambiguous boundary and looked back at Cassion.</p>
<p>He greeted her first.</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>The greeting was terrible in its awkwardness. Even so, with a light chuckle, Rosetta entered the room.</p>
<p>Thud.</p>
<p>Behind the hushed laughter, the sound of the door closing echoed throughout the room.</p>
<p>“You’re awake. Have you eaten?”</p>
<p>As she spoke, Rosetta placed the lamp on the table and her cloak on the backrest of a chair.</p>
<p>Cassion observed her movements as she set down the lamp and the cloak, then he opened his lips to speak.</p>
<p>“I already ate. What about you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, me too. I ate something much better than a recovering patient’s meal.”</p>
<p>While answering playfully, she gradually walked towards the bed.</p>
<p>Her steps were quiet on the floor, as though she was tiptoeing in the dead of the night, trying not to wake a sleeping person.</p>
<p>Watching the woman approach him slowly, Cassion suddenly recalled what happened earlier.</p>
<p>When he pretended that he didn’t know she was there.</p>
<p>From that moment onwards and until now, he’d been asking himself about why he pretended to sleep. He still didn’t have an answer.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe that he didn’t even know the reason behind his actions. Really, it was a laughable thing.</p>
<p>While Cassion was lost in thought, Rosetta continued to draw near him.</p>
<p>As the distance between them grew closer, the appearance of the approaching person could be seen more clearly.</p>
<p>Like a stranger hidden in the dark, the scent on her body permeated the air.</p>
<p>Cassion had been absent-minded until now, but this is what brought him back to his senses.</p>
<p>A clear expression. A distinct scent.</p>
<p>Rosetta should have had a strange, subtle scent of roses, just as she did before.</p>
<p>Wasn’t that why he noticed that the person visiting him earlier was her, even with his eyes closed?</p>
<p>The fragrance of roses.</p>
<p>But right now, it was different.</p>
<p>This scent.</p>
<p>It was a familiar, unpleasant scent.</p>
<p>‘Blood…’</p>
<p>At the metallic scent, Cassion’s forehead became wrinkled.</p>
<p>His eyes narrowed shallowly as he looked at Rosetta, who smelled like blood.</p>
<p>The moon was bright today.</p>
<p>After opening the curtains, Rosetta once again walked towards Cassion.</p>
<p>This unusually bright moonlight poured into the room, this unusually bright moonlight shone upon Rosetta.</p>
<p>There was a soft pink hue on those red lips upon her face that was as white as a sheet.</p>
<p>Cassion looked up at her silently with a deep wrinkle in the middle of his forehead. Seeing this, Rosetta tilted her head to the side and asked.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? Is there something on my face?”</p>
<p>For a moment, Cassion hesitated.</p>
<p>Evidently, something seemed to have happened, but he hesitated because he wasn’t sure whether it was something he should be inquiring about. It was his first time meeting a woman like her.</p>
<p>It’s only been a few days since they met, but during those few days, the Rosetta he knew was always a composed, elegant, and sometimes playful woman.</p>
<p>Even so, his hesitant lips eventually let go of the words.</p>
<p>“You. Your complexion doesn’t look so good. There’s also the scent of blood on you. Are you… injured?”</p>
<p>He himself has had a troubled life, and it was the constant indifference that made him terribly lonely.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it was better to turn a blind eye and pretend not to know.</p>
<p>He knew this. But…</p>
<p>For him, if he were to choose between ‘apathy’ or ‘meddling’, it was undeniable that the latter was more of a caring act.</p>
<p>But at Cassion’s question, Rosetta’s expression hardened.</p>
<p>Gradually, it was as though ink droplets had fallen into water and then on, spread out.</p>
<p>The corners of her smoothly curved lips lowered for a moment.</p>
<p>“Really? My complexion isn’t good and I smell like blood?”</p>
<p>Rather than a question, the small murmur was like a small realization.</p>
<p>In fact, Rosetta just found out that her complexion was bad.</p>
<p>But she knew she’d be left with the scent of blood.</p>
<p>She had come to a place where the same metallic smell permeated everywhere after all, and she also touched Katie through the steel cage bars with her hands.</p>
<p>So it wasn’t surprising that the smell lingered.</p>
<p>However, she didn’t expect that she would also look pale.</p>
<p>She felt a little sick, but was that enough that she would visibly look terrible?</p>
<p>Well, she could roughly guess the reason.</p>
<p>Her condition was exceedingly bad—this was the unpleasant reason.</p>
<p>“I’m not injured. I went to see my nanny. The one who’s locked up in the dungeon right now.”</p>
<p>Instead of the conclusion she had come up with, she answered with a half-truth.</p>
<p>The best kind of lies were, of course, ones that were based on the truth.</p>
<p>And without any doubt, Cassion accepted Rosetta’s response.</p>
<p>Her ashy complexion and lingering scent of blood made sense if the given reason was her nanny who had abused her.</p>
<p>Cassion felt a little awkward.</p>
<p>He knew at the back of his mind that there wouldn’t be a good story behind it, but the moment he heard her explanation, he didn’t know how to react.</p>
<p>He’d been alone for such a long time that he had never known what comfort was like.</p>
<p>As his hesitation was made apparent in his expression, Rosetta had a light smile on her lips.</p>
<p>The woman, who had shed a smile, soon sat down at the end of the bed, facing away from Cassion.</p>
<p>Rustle.</p>
<p>As the blanket rustled where the woman sat, and the man’s hand escaped from where it was and retreated closer to his own body.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that his hand had been close enough to touch her, it’s just that his fingertips began to tingle.</p>
<p>Cassion’s gaze was stuck on his fingertips.</p>
<p>Then, this gaze crossed down the white blanket and headed towards the woman who sat on the same bed as him.</p>
<p>Her side profile, as she was looking at the door, was sharp.</p>
<p>The lamp in the distance cast a scarlet glow upon her face.</p>
<p>It was a warm, dangerous color.</p>
<p>Behind the unreadable smile, her long silver hair glistened in the moonlight.</p>
<p>A thought crossed Cassion’s mind, that she had really unusual hair.</p>
<p>The light was red, but why was it that her shimmering silver hair wasn’t being tinged by the scarlet color?</p>
<p>Even though they were in the same space, strangely, it felt like only the place where Rosetta sat looked picturesque.</p>
<p>Red light and pale features coexisted, warmth and frost intermingled, tranquility and danger coalesced.</p>
<p>Soon, the woman who was still all this time turned her head. Her hair slightly fluttered from the movement, but soon settled down once more.</p>
<p>Their eyes met again.</p>
<p>Having yet to answer, Cassion gulped dryly.</p>
<p>Those golden eyes, which seemed to have been clouded, regained their sharpness.</p>
<p>Under an odd sense of pressure, Cassion broke eye contact first.</p>
<p>As he dropped his gaze, his eyes looked towards his fingertips.</p>
<p>When he slightly turned his own hand over, he saw a long scar across his palm.</p>
<p>Rosetta had unwrapped the bandages, and he was reminded that his mana had started to flow.</p>
<p>“…A few years ago… I fell down a flight of stairs. Someone pushed me from behind. It was a servant who I thought was kind. As I fell, the gaze that looked back at me was clear. I don’t think I’ll ever forget it.”</p>
<p>His previously closed lips had started to speak calmly.</p>
<p>Rosetta already knew that he would try to comfort her, but at the unexpected beginning, she could only blink in response.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 38</p>
<p>“Ever since then, I had developed a deep apprehension for stairs. I was alright when going up, but it’s hard whenever I go down the steps. I always needed to be close to the railing when descending. My eyes would spin and the steps would look like they’re overlapping, so I often needed to stop in place and catch my breath.”</p>
<p>Despite how calmly he spoke, the words he said didn’t match his tone. Rosetta listened wordlessly as Cassion continued to speak.</p>
<p>“If someone were to pass by me, I got so frightened to the point of death, so I’d embrace the railing as though it’s a lifeline and wait until that person would pass by. But…”</p>
<p>Rosetta could guess what his intention was.</p>
<p>What he’s doing right now was to console her indirectly.</p>
<p>“But now, I can go down the stairs just fine. To be honest, I still feel like a newborn fawn needing to hang onto its mother whenever I look down, but at least I don’t need to cling onto the balusters anymore. I’m satisfied enough with that.”</p>
<p>He ended the story somewhat awkwardly.</p>
<p>‘That’s why you’ll also be able to forget your bad memories of her.’</p>
<p>These words were left unsaid.</p>
<p>More than that, the story he spoke of was not far from what Rosetta had guessed.</p>
<p>It wasn’t even because of Katie that Rosetta’s complexion had turned pale.</p>
<p>Even so, in spite of this.</p>
<p>Rosetta felt a strange warmth filling one corner of her heart.</p>
<p>The corners of her lips tugged up slightly.</p>
<p>The lamp’s illumination was still shining on her face, but the sense of danger it brought had somehow disappeared.</p>
<p>“Thank you. What you said brings me comfort.”</p>
<p>No matter how much she thought about it, he wasn’t suited for the role of a villain.</p>
<p>The words that her red lips murmured under her breath were too faint for Cassion to hear.</p>
<p>“Huh? What did you say just now?”</p>
<p>Cassion asked back, but Rosetta just shrugged as though she didn’t have an idea.</p>
<p>He clearly heard something at that moment, but without prying further, the man simply nodded.</p>
<p>He asked something else instead.</p>
<p>“Then, what brings you here at this hour?”</p>
<p>To be exact, between during the day and their meeting now, what reason was there for her to visit him twice?</p>
<p>A while ago as he recalled, Rosetta went to talk to the Young Duke of Valentine before she had visited Cassion here the first time.</p>
<p>Not much time elapsed, so he surmised that she had come here to see him right after their conversation.</p>
<p>If that’s the case, then was she here to talk about something regarding the young duke?</p>
<p>While thinking so, Cassion felt a little nervous.</p>
<p>The reason Rosetta had gone with Damian to talk to him was because she said, ‘I want Maxwell to be my escort knight.’</p>
<p>Naturally, it’s clear that she had talked to the Young Duke about Maxwell.</p>
<p>Rosetta had been looking at Cassion at this time, but she slowly turned away. She stared at nothing in particular for a moment.</p>
<p>Then, her red lips gently moved.</p>
<p>“Ah, right. I’m here for something.”</p>
<p>Her tone was so casual that the tension in the air was overshadowed.</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I forgot for a bit while we talked. Right, I forgot, I came here because there’s something I need to do.”</p>
<p>The voice that asked was incredulous, and the voice that answered back was nonchalant.</p>
<p>It seemed like Rosetta took a moment to organize her thoughts, pressing one fingernail against another finger. Then, she nodded and opened her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“Just as was planned, I told my brother about you—about Maxwell. After talking about our shared past, I asked him if we can take you in as my escort knight.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“He gave me permission. You’ll be my escort knight.”</p>
<p>“…Truly? He allowed it?”</p>
<p>At Cassion’s question that’s filled with suspicion, Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“However, there’s a condition attached to it. I came to tell you about that condition.”</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>The man let out a small sigh. Rather than an expression of dismay, it was more like him saying, ‘I knew it.’</p>
<p>“What’s the condition?”</p>
<p>At first glance, it seemed as though resolution overflowed his eyes that were the color of the night sky.</p>
<p>At the satisfactory reaction, Rosetta smiled smoothly.</p>
<p>Right. If you’re determined, naturally, you should be like that.</p>
<p>That kind of determination to overcome everything shouldn’t be swayed by any kind of condition.</p>
<p>“There will be a test—it’s to prove that you’re at least someone who’s capable of protecting me.</p>
<p>What Damian demanded was ‘proof’.</p>
<p>As Rosetta asked, Damian would allow Cassion to be her ‘escort knight’, but he wouldn’t accept everything about him just like that.</p>
<p>First of all, the duty of an ‘escort knight’ was just one thing—to protect their master.</p>
<p>And while protecting their master, this wouldn’t be limited to just the act of falling down a set of stairs for the master.</p>
<p>He would need to defend against any sudden attacks and protect his master during any sudden threat.</p>
<p>It wasn’t enough to just have the will to protect—a certain degree of ‘competence’ was needed.</p>
<p>If the escort knight was someone who didn’t have even the basics of combat, then rather than an escort, he’d just be more like a companion.</p>
<p>Of course, Cassion knew that he was competent enough to be Rosetta’s escort knight. But even if Damian were to give up everything else, he wouldn’t be able to consider Rosetta’s ‘safety’ as something trivial.</p>
<p>“You’ll be put to test in two months, after your body recovers. You’ll have a match against another knight, and of course, you have to win to pass this test.”</p>
<p>“A match against a knight…”</p>
<p>It felt as though his lips had gone dry.</p>
<p>With one index finger, Cassion rubbed his lower lip.</p>
<p>It was decided this action would be one of Maxwell’s habits that he usually did whenever he was nervous, so he constantly practiced this over the past two days.</p>
<p>This habit had settled on him faster than expected, and right now, he was rubbing his lower lip purely as an unconscious gesture.</p>
<p>Acknowledging this, Rosetta raised her brows eagerly.</p>
<p>“Since you’re a commoner, they’re going to select an easy opponent for you. It’ll be a knight who’s been appointed only two years ago.”</p>
<p>That was all she could tell him about this condition.</p>
<p>As soon as Rosetta stopped the explanation there, Cassion nodded as though he noticed.</p>
<p>The heavy movement seemed stiff as he nodded, but that was all.</p>
<p>There was no sign of any complaint, dissatisfaction, or any other negative emotion pointing to grievance on his countenance at all—except that he was staring intently at something.</p>
<p>Rosetta glanced over to the spot where that dark gaze was fixed.</p>
<p>But there was nothing there.</p>
<p>Just the wall with one painting on it.</p>
<p>In a situation like this, he wouldn’t just be looking at a painting so intently, so rather than that, it seemed like he was picking up his resolve as he stared into the air.</p>
<p>After lingering on that spot, Rosetta turned back, her gaze passing through Cassion and now settling out the window.</p>
<p>The unusually bright moonlight made her eyes shine.</p>
<p>As Rosetta stared at the quiet moonlight, an indirect question flowed out of her lips.</p>
<p>“You’re much humbler than I thought, aren’t you? You don’t have even a single complaint.”</p>
<p>He had still been staring into the air at that point, but only then did his gaze finally come upon Rosetta. At this moment, her eyes were intent on the moon, and so Cassion turned his head and also stared at the same moon.</p>
<p>“Just because I don’t like something means that it will change. And frankly, I’m already surprised enough that I’ve been allowed to be an escort knight, even a ‘conditional’ one. Back in the hotel, when I heard the plan about me becoming an escort knight, I thought it was complete nonsense.”</p>
<p>Rosetta blinked for a moment. No, was it like that?</p>
<p>She didn’t notice at all.</p>
<p>No wonder. When he listened to Rosetta’s plan the first time, his expression was stiff.</p>
<p>She thought he had frozen up because he was nervous, but in fact, he actually thought that it was all ridiculous.</p>
<p>With disbelief painted on her face, Rosetta looked at Cassion and smiled in vain.</p>
<p>“No… You really believe so?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I did. If I’m having second thoughts like this, then it must not have been an easy decision for your older brother. He was convinced probably because of your efforts. So I’m not going to complain, I’ll just do what I’m supposed to do.”</p>
<p>In his calm declaration, his sincere determination could be felt.</p>
<p>Although the clenched fist he had there made him look as though he was making a terrible pledge.</p>
<p>Rosetta looked at that hateful fist, she held her hand up wordlessly.</p>
<p>They were both still facing out the window, so her movement was something he didn’t see.</p>
<p>Whoosh. A small gust of air blew towards his neck.</p>
<p>Under the pressure that came in an instant, like a broken machine, Cassion moved his head.</p>
<p>As his head turned to her, Rosetta looked sideways and made eye contact with him.</p>
<p>Even in the darkness, those widened pupils could be seen.</p>
<p>With her eyes slowly curving, Rosetta relaxed her hand. The drooping fingers tapped on the middle of Cassion’s neck.</p>
<p>“From now on, with these things that cause the blockage—I’ll help you with them as well.”</p>
<p>The hard tips of her fingernails could be felt on his skin.</p>
<p>Startled, his eyes turned towards her haphazardly as he grabbed her wrist.</p>
<p>“If you don’t do it to this extent, will it still feel like thorns breaking out?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it will. That’s why you have to get used to it. If you don’t, let alone winning the spar, you’d only be humiliated.”</p>
<p>At the rather straightforward statement, Cassion sighed.</p>
<p>It was sad, but he couldn’t refute her.</p>
<p>Even Rosetta in front of him right now was much stronger than he was.</p>
<p>Was it because she was a daughter of a knight’s family, or was it because she’s a special case?</p>
<p>She was a woman who talked about the future as well.</p>
<p>Even if she were to do something strange, well, it’s just like that.</p>
<p>There were many times when Cassion wanted to ask her, ‘What are you?’ but he never did.</p>
<p>Because regardless of what answers come out of her lips, nothing would change—in the end, they would both still be on the same boat.</p>
<p>“Will you keep holding on?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>As Cassion was lost in thought, he replied foolishly. At that, Rosetta pointed a finger.</p>
<p>“Your hand, I mean. This.”</p>
<p>The finger brushed past the man’s wrist. Startled, Cassion flinched back as though he had gotten burned.</p>
<p>Rosetta rose from the bed right then, shrugging her shoulders with a playful expression on her face.</p>
<p>“Ah, this should be obvious, but don’t get caught wielding magic by others. Maxwell doesn’t even know anything about magic. And don’t leave this room for about a week. Try not to run into other people for as long as possible.”</p>
<p>“But won’t that delay my training?”</p>
<p>There were only two months, so wouldn’t that just be a waste of time?</p>
<p>However, Rosetta just shook her head firmly.</p>
<p>“This room is spacious enough if there’s something you want to do. I’m sure your brother’s still looking around for you anxiously. There’s nothing bad about being more careful.”</p>
<p>At the mention of Leo, Cassion quickly closed his mouth.</p>
<p>Just as Rosetta said, the Leo who Cassion knew very well would be quite persistent in trying to find any trace of him.</p>
<p>When it came to Leo, he’s the kind of person who’d be more restless when he’d fail to get rid of something that annoyed him.</p>
<p>“That too, is that a future that you’ve foreseen?”</p>
<p>To answer Cassion’s question, Rosetta nodded.</p>
<p>“Mm. That’s why just lay low and stay inside the room.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>Him being obedient like this made him look like a big puppy.</p>
<p>While thinking that she might not be weak against ‘repentant’ characters, Rosetta reached up to get something from her bosom.</p>
<p>As she searched through, her hand soon took out some frayed, folded pieces of paper, which she handed to Cassion.</p>
<p>“Here, take this.”</p>
<p>“What’s this?”</p>
<p>“Well, what else could it be?”</p>
<p>Answering his question with another question, Rosetta turned away from him.</p>
<p>She walked towards the door without hesitation. She didn’t forget to bring with her the cloak and the lamp.</p>
<p>“Read it when you’re alone later. And hide it well so that no one can find those. Then, good night.”</p>
<p>After saying so, Rosetta went out the door.</p>
<p>Thud.</p>
<p>The sound of the door closing quietly echoed inside the room.</p>
<p>For a long time, Cassion looked towards the direction where Rosetta disappeared. Then slowly, he unfolded the papers in his hand.</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>A smirk lightly crossed his lips.</p>
<p>At the top of the paper, he unfolded were these words:</p>
<p>〈 Practical Magic Spells to Use During an Actual Fight That No One Would Notice 〉</p>
<p>Laughter rang out in that empty room.</p>
<p>Head tilted to the side while he looked at the notes, Cassion chuckled heartily as he wiped off the few tears that escaped his eyes.</p>
<p>And within the gaze that read through the notes, a pleasant light and a serious glimmer could be seen together.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 39</p>
<p>t/n: okay, i’m totally backtracking here and i apologize in advance._.)</p>
<p>i’ve been wrestling with this for the past 10 chapters or so, but i belatedly realized that using third-person pov for the entire novel just doesn’t work, even if it looks better on the page. our FL is dealing with a lot of body/identity dysmorphia, so it doesn’t make sense for me to keep referring to her as ‘rosetta’ during her personal moments—especially in this chapter.</p>
<p>that’s why i’ll be going back to switching between first-person pov and third-person pov, just as the author has intended. when the pov shifts happen, there will be section breaks to indicate the changes in perspective so you don’t have to worry—it won’t be as confusing as it sounds. sorry for the inconvenience and i hope you guys understand!</p>
<p>——</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>Everywhere I looked, it was dark.</p>
<p>In a world where I knew not whether it was night or day, I let out a cloudy breath. What was certain was that, here, I was dreaming.</p>
<p>The third transmigration. Rita.</p>
<p>Humid air filled my lungs. I clenched my throat with a weak hand. I felt suffocated and I didn’t know why.</p>
<p>My lips quivered and, without my knowledge, they were drawn into a crescent arc.</p>
<p>Several streams of hot tears flowed out of my eyes.</p>
<p>Those droplets brushed my cheeks and wet my ears.</p>
<p>It was like I was drowning.</p>
<p>I cried. I laughed.</p>
<p>My tears flowed against my will, my laughter broke out because it felt like I’d go crazy if I didn’t let it out.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha, ha…”</p>
<p>In the air, a broken voice rang.</p>
<p>In this dark space, my voice echoed.</p>
<p>In this endless silence, my teeth clenched together.</p>
<p>My lips were now closed, trying to suppress this laughter.</p>
<p>Was this a cry close to laughter? Was this a laugh close to crying?</p>
<p>As I lay down for a long time, feeling as though I was a crazed lunatic, I heard the creaking sound of a door opening.</p>
<p>I swallowed my breath.</p>
<p>Without noticing this, the skin over my neck was scratched because the hand that had grabbed it grew tense.</p>
<p>A prickling sensation swept throughout my entire body.</p>
<p>It was terribly realistic.</p>
<p>Ah, seriously… how terribly realistic.</p>
<p>Familiar footsteps began their approach. Accompanying these footsteps was the sound of something being dragged across the floor.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes. This was making me nauseous.</p>
<p>I clamped my lips together, but I couldn’t stop my teeth from chattering.</p>
<p>Ta-dak, ta-dak, ta-dak.</p>
<p>At the sound of the steady footsteps approaching, the sound of my heart gradually turned to a crescendo.</p>
<p>Ba-dump, ba-dump, ba-dump.</p>
<p>To the extent that I wish my ears would just be deafened by this loud noise.</p>
<p>However, these harsh footsteps did not stop.</p>
<p>They only became clearer.</p>
<p>With the hand that wasn’t on my neck, I scratched the floor at my side. My fingers and nails brushed smoothly through the terribly soft carpet.</p>
<p>Soon, at some point, those footsteps stopped.</p>
<p>Thud, splash.</p>
<p>Something fell to the floor, and along with it, something splashed.</p>
<p>Then, a horrendous stench.</p>
<p>A dreadfully familiar, dreadfully metallic, dreadfully pain-inducing stench.</p>
<p>At the unbearable nausea that came to me, I opened my heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>In this dark space, there was the illumination of a scarlet flame filling the void.</p>
<p>The shadows created by that candle danced dangerously.</p>
<p>And the shadow of a person reflected on the wall was like an enormous monster.</p>
<p>As though I had been struggling to break free from a bout of sleep paralysis, I sat up at once, my upper body snapping up.</p>
<p>“Uuurk.”</p>
<p>And the nausea I had been pushing down eventually let loose.</p>
<p>Scorching gastric fluids passed through my stomach, came up my esophagus, reached my uvula.</p>
<p>It felt like my stomach was on fire.</p>
<p>Tears that were as scorching as these gastric fluids soaked the floor.</p>
<p>While throwing up only these gastric fluids for a long time, that person made not one noise.</p>
<p>I know for sure—he will pull my legs back in place and look down on me.</p>
<p>I gasped audibly. This terrible hell. When will I be able to wake up?</p>
<p>I do not wish to look up, forever.</p>
<p>Just, I wish to live with my face down on the floor. So that I will not have to raise my head and face reality.</p>
<p>Just, forever. Rather, forever.</p>
<p>My head hit the ground with nothing. Seeing nothing, hearing nothing. Nothing at all…</p>
<p>It was at that moment.</p>
<p>“Ri… ta…”</p>
<p>With a pained moan, someone called my name.</p>
<p>My body stopped trembling for a moment.</p>
<p>Perhaps, I thought that maybe my heart had even stopped.</p>
<p>I shut my eyes, and slowly opened them once more.</p>
<p>The two hands that supported my body scratched the floor, and as expected, only soft fur brushed past my fingertips.</p>
<p>“Haa…”</p>
<p>The breath that was lodged at my throat poured out as though it was vomit.</p>
<p>Slowly, I raised my head.</p>
<p>And it was as though time had stopped.</p>
<p>At the end of that glaring gaze, I gradually began to see familiar characters.</p>
<p>The ground at the edge of my view was stained red.</p>
<p>Wet.</p>
<p>One character’s body writhed on the floor.</p>
<p>Perhaps even the smallest of movements caused him pain, and that character soon coughed out roughly.</p>
<p>The breaths that were spat out, scratching his neck, were broken.</p>
<p>Bright, vivid, red liquid tainted his pale lips.</p>
<p>And next to the character who was on the floor, there was a pair of shoes that another character wore.</p>
<p>Red marks remained as stains on those white shoes.</p>
<p>Soon, one white shoe went under the chin of the man who had collapsed to the floor.</p>
<p>Then, as though playing with a mere ball, that shoe brushed along the man’s broken jaw.</p>
<p>“Ah… ah…”</p>
<p>I let out what sounded like a dullard’s groans.</p>
<p>Crawling on the ground on both hands and feet, my nails scraped along the carpet.</p>
<p>I stumbled several times because I had no strength left in this body. However, I did not stop moving.</p>
<p>“Ri… Ri… ta…”</p>
<p>Again, that broken voice called my name. I clenched my lips to hold back my screams.</p>
<p>It tasted metallic. My lips had torn.</p>
<p>Again, nausea. But I endured it and continued crawling.</p>
<p>As I came closer to them, that white shoe also returned to its original place.</p>
<p>The owner of those shoes crouched down.</p>
<p>Leaning down with his knees bent, he grabbed the blood-soaked man’s hair.</p>
<p>It was just then that I arrived in front of the cage, which kept me locked away from freedom.</p>
<p>One hand on an iron bar, one hand through the gaps, the only part of me that could escape.</p>
<p>As far as I could, I stretched my arm as far as possible and grasped at the air.</p>
<p>But there was nothing I could touch.</p>
<p>Just a few inches.</p>
<p>Just a few inches more.</p>
<p>My shoulder tightened. As it was against the iron bars around it, it screamed in pain as though my arm was about to fall off.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I did not stop swinging it in the air.</p>
<p>The man who had his face on the ground struggled.</p>
<p>It should be easy to raise one’s head, and yet he had to make several attempts just to lift his forehead from the ground.</p>
<p>“AAGH!”</p>
<p>And each time, I screamed.</p>
<p>My stomach was scorched black.</p>
<p>It felt as though I had swallowed red, burning fire in one gulp.</p>
<p>Soon, as I barely lifted my face, a blurry gaze met mine.</p>
<p>Perhaps we made eye contact. Perhaps we couldn’t.</p>
<p>“Ri… ta…”</p>
<p>He called my name again.</p>
<p>And, that was the end.</p>
<p>One dull sound— and the gasping breaths stopped.</p>
<p>I blinked.</p>
<p>This, what the hell… what…</p>
<p>The man who had his head slammed to the ground no longer moved.</p>
<p>I stared blankly at the man who no longer breathed, and soon, I screamed at the top of my lungs.</p>
<p>“AAHHH! BROTHER! BROTHER!! NO… NO!”</p>
<p>My—Rita’s—brother could not answer.</p>
<p>Forever.</p>
<p>Amidst the excruciating screams, a kind voice rang out.</p>
<p>“Rita, look at this. You shouldn’t have tricked me and tried to run away.”</p>
<p>That kind voice sent goosebumps up my skin.</p>
<p>I looked towards the man crouching in front of me.</p>
<p>Red hair. Green eyes.</p>
<p>A man who resembled a rose.</p>
<p>Those eyes of his were bent into arches, as kind as his voice.</p>
<p>The angel-like face smiled softly, and soon after, it seemed as though a halo was shining over his head.</p>
<p>In fact, most people truly believed that there was a halo over him.</p>
<p>Because in this entire kingdom, he was the temple’s most honorable high priest.</p>
<p>O, esteemed high priest.</p>
<p>O, beautiful emissary of God.</p>
<p>O, pure white messenger.</p>
<p>“Yurian…”</p>
<p>It was the name of the man I loathed to the deepest of my soul, so much so that I wanted to run away from him even though I knew I could die.</p>
<p>‘Yurian’, the male lead of this goddamned third novel.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>Everywhere I looked, it was bright.</p>
<p>The deep blue dawn’s light was brighter than I expected.</p>
<p>I lay still and looked around.</p>
<p>“Ha… ha, ha…”</p>
<p>Laughter burst anew from my lips. Fortunately, tears did not flow this time, unlike in that dream.</p>
<p>I covered my face with both hands.</p>
<p>The salty tears that soaked my palms rubbed against my skin, and finally, a clear realization of reality woke me up.</p>
<p>‘Seriously, goddamned nightmare…’</p>
<p>It’s been such a long time since I last had such a vivid dream.</p>
<p>Ah, of course… The night I had a dream of the past, I embraced Alicia, and yet.</p>
<p>This was worse than the other one. There was no nightmare more horrifying than facing that son of a b*tch.</p>
<p>I slowly rose from the bed. My entire body was soaked with cold sweat.</p>
<p>As though I’d been fished out of water, drowning.</p>
<p>I probably look pale.</p>
<p>Like when I had gone to the dungeon to meet Katie last night.</p>
<p>I told Cassion that I was pale because of Katie, but in fact… it was because of the ‘underground prison’ itself.</p>
<p>As I entered an environment where darkness, dampness and the smell of blood permeated, I was subconsciously reminded of the past.</p>
<p>And the nightmare of that day might be because of the same reason.</p>
<p>That intense memory of the past subconsciously made its way into my dream.</p>
<p>Sighing, I brought a hand to my forehead.</p>
<p>Even without looking into a mirror, I could easily guess that I looked ridiculous at this moment.</p>
<p>‘If Cassion sees me like this, will he ask again if I’m alright?’</p>
<p>Suddenly, as this question popped into my head, I laughed in vain.</p>
<p>Ah, seriously, the worst.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘Seeing that it’s still peaceful, I don’t think I was caught, fortunately.’</p>
<p>It’s been about a week since Cassion was brought into the mansion—a week since that terrible nightmare.</p>
<p>As Leo was looking for any traces of Cassion, he was two days late compared to what he had done in the novel.</p>
<p>It was tranquil inside the mansion, and there was also no particular loud news coming from outside.</p>
<p>Some would glance at the room of the stranger who the illegitimate daughter had picked up, but that kind of interest did not last more than a day.</p>
<p>Perhaps it was because of Katie.</p>
<p>It must have been quite a sight to see Katie, who had been working at the mansion for a very long time, being arrested. Following that was a series of house arrests of servants as they were forced to stay in their quarters.</p>
<p>Among those who continued to work at the ducal estate, no one wanted to dig their own grave with such useless curiosity.</p>
<p>In conclusion, so far, no one had suspected Cassion or tried to corner him.</p>
<p>‘Certainly, it would be difficult to make a connection.’</p>
<p>That the Valentine Duchy’s illegitimate daughter had picked up the Carter Duchy’s disgrace—who would ever put two and two together.</p>
<p>Nodding satisfactorily, I couldn’t resist the rush of fatigue and let out a slight yawn.</p>
<p>“Sister, are you… are you tired? Should we go back?”</p>
<p>A small voice that was only slightly louder than the wind let out these timid worries.</p>
<p>As I turned my head, I made eye contact with Alicia, who was looking at me with concern.</p>
<p>For a moment, it slipped my mind that Alicia was next to me.</p>
<p>And besides that, we were taking a walk in the garden on this bright, summer day right now.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 40</p>
<p>As I had closed my lips while I was deep in thought, Alicia was probably sensitive to my changes in demeanor.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there’s no way she’d react like this to a mere silent yawn.</p>
<p>I shook my gaze, though relieved by the warm gaze on me that’s reminiscent of the spring sun.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. I couldn’t sleep well last night.”</p>
<p>“I think you also said that last time… I hope you’re not sick, Sister.”</p>
<p>“I’m really fine. Don’t worry, I just really didn’t sleep well.”</p>
<p>After giving her a small smile, I shrugged and looked away.</p>
<p>I could still feel Alicia’s gaze on me because of the piercing feeling at the side of my face, but I walked forward as though I didn’t notice.</p>
<p>Soon, I felt the gaze that was hot against my cheeks moving away.</p>
<p>Anyway, isn’t she cute.</p>
<p>No matter how much I thought about it, those two were so similar.</p>
<p>Alicia and Cassion.</p>
<p>If Alicia was a small puppy, Cassion felt like a huge puppy.</p>
<p>In conclusion, both resembled dogs… No, puppies, more like.</p>
<p>‘I knew it, I must be weak against pups.’</p>
<p>That’s why I care about those two.</p>
<p>It was a reasonable guess in its own way.</p>
<p>“Sister.”</p>
<p>When I fell into my own thoughts again and stopped talking, Alicia called out to me in a small voice.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>At the timid call, I lowered my gaze and looked at Alicia.</p>
<p>Alicia wasn’t looking this way and just blinked. But even so, she looked like she was feeling anxious about something.</p>
<p>It was too much of an excessive reaction to just seeing how tired I looked.</p>
<p>She chewed on her lips for a moment before she slowly opened them to speak.</p>
<p>“Um… Our nanny… No, Katie. Have you heard about her?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t until the name ‘Katie’ was uttered by her pink lips that I understood what she was anxious about.</p>
<p>It hadn’t been long since the incident happened, and Katie would remain to be a trigger for Alicia.</p>
<p>The abuse had lasted for more than a decade, and the memories of it would not be so easily forgotten.</p>
<p>With a gentle touch, I patted Alicia’s shoulder and spoke.</p>
<p>“Katie? What about her?”</p>
<p>Alicia had been looking into the distance blankly until then, but she turned to me and smiled awkwardly as she met my gaze.</p>
<p>She seemed to look better than before.</p>
<p>“The maid who’s serving me right now said that, well… She said that Katie can’t talk anymore.”</p>
<p>This time, I was the one who blinked.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect to hear about this straight from Alicia.</p>
<p>This situation is pretty interesting.</p>
<p>“Oh my, how in the world.”</p>
<p>It was a problem that I knew about the matter more than anyone else, but I pretended to know nothing.</p>
<p>I stopped walking as Alicia said this, and she as well stopped in her tracks.</p>
<p>“She can’t talk anymore? How did she end up that way?”</p>
<p>When I asked with my eyes wide open, Alicia met my gaze and gulped down. Her cheeks became tinted with pink.</p>
<p>Why on earth.</p>
<p>Alicia sometimes still blushed whenever she faced me.</p>
<p>I don’t know how long this will last, but it wasn’t all that bad. It’s cute.</p>
<p>“I’m not sure. I don’t think anyone knows the reason. Maybe it’s the shock of being imprisoned… Or at least, that’s everyone’s guess.”</p>
<p>She stuttered a little, shy as she spoke. I nodded and listened carefully to her words.</p>
<p>“A…ha.”</p>
<p>When she was done talking, I let out a small exclamation.</p>
<p>After hearing the end of Alicia’s explanation, I was relieved that no one seemed to be suspecting me.</p>
<p>In fact, there was nothing to be relieved about.</p>
<p>There was no connection between Katie’s inability to speak and ‘me’, just how unlikely it was to think about a connection between me and Cassion.</p>
<p>I pretended to be lost in thought for a while, not saying anything, but I soon asked.</p>
<p>“Then she must be communicating through writing now. I heard that the interrogation isn’t completely over yet.”</p>
<p>‘If you don’t have a mouth, you’re bound to speak with your hands.’</p>
<p>This was what I felt uncomfortable about the most this whole time.</p>
<p>It was good that Katie’s lips had been sealed, but she still had enough education to the extent that she was a nanny of a duke’s children.</p>
<p>And writing was the basics of the basics.</p>
<p>‘Should I go back and twist both her wrists?’</p>
<p>I’ve been thinking about doing this already, but I decided not to pursue the thought.</p>
<p>If I do such a thing, wouldn’t that just be tantamount to advertising that an intruder came into the dungeon?</p>
<p>Besides, people would start suspecting why Katie lost her voice all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Well, I did still come back there one more time before.</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s… Strangely, when she’s given a piece of paper and a pen, she thrashes and refuses to accept them. She looks entirely frightened.”</p>
<p>This was both surprising and not surprising at all.</p>
<p>This was the result of me visiting the dungeon again to solve the worries that have been making me uncomfortable.</p>
<p>‘A mouth that can’t speak, hands that can’t be used.’</p>
<p>I made this happen.</p>
<p>I met Katie in the dungeon for a second time exactly a day after I first visited her. I had to take into account that people communicate not only with their mouths, but also through other means.</p>
<p>As I whispered to her, I smiled and looked into her frightened eyes.</p>
<p>’You know how many fingers a person has, right? If you don’t want us to count one by one while I break them one at a time, you’d better keep your hands to yourself, Katie.’</p>
<p>Then, I gripped Katie’s shoulders and exuded a light killing intent.</p>
<p>I judged that this threat should be enough, but the more you stomp on a stone bridge, the more you can be sure that it’s safe.</p>
<p>After some time, simultaneously as I released the killing intent, I turned my back on her. But soon after, I heard a rattling sound behind me.</p>
<p>During that loud noise, not a single word was uttered.</p>
<p>I left the basement, leaving behind small echoes of my pleasant humming.</p>
<p>It was a good night in its own way. Except for the fact that a pale memory Yurian had followed in that nightmare.</p>
<p>Recalling what happened last night, I looked at Alicia with a serious expression.</p>
<p>It seemed as if she was worried about how shocked I’d be from hearing that ‘if Katie’s given a pen and paper, she’d thrash.’</p>
<p>And I did act as though I was surprised. I covered my mouth.</p>
<p>I can’t let down Alicia when it comes to her expectations.</p>
<p>Then, I carefully rubbed my own lips.</p>
<p>“Oh my. That…”</p>
<p>That’s good.</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>As I spoke in a very small voice, Alicia widened her eyes and asked back.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>Smiling, I shook my head and lifted the corners of my lips.</p>
<p>She looked at me with a bit of a doubtful expression, but I looked forward again.</p>
<p>As I began to walk forward slowly, the halted steps behind me diligently followed by my side once more.</p>
<p>The sound of grass being brushed against was refreshing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘Father’s coming back soon.’</p>
<p>On our way back to our rooms from the garden, Alicia uttered these words lightly, and it’s been on my mind since.</p>
<p>Father—Duke Valentine was coming back soon.</p>
<p>I crossed the deserted hallway and recalled lightly what today’s date was.</p>
<p>‘You’re coming back earlier than I thought.’</p>
<p>No, perhaps he’s actually coming later than he should?</p>
<p>With all these subtle emotions, I felt complicated.</p>
<p>It’s a relief, but at the same time, it’s such a shame.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be good for the duke to return.</p>
<p>The day he’d come back would probably be Katie’s execution day.</p>
<p>A woman with poison on her tongue would be better off taken care of as soon as possible.</p>
<p>I barely managed to hold down that worm who thinks she’s a snake, but it would be much more difficult if I hadn’t settled it before he truly acted like a snake.</p>
<p>In particular, if she tried to write down that secret she’s so proud of when I had yet to twist her wrists…</p>
<p>I halted my steps.</p>
<p>This was because my legs felt wooden for a moment.</p>
<p>After having walked this far without thinking about where I was going, I stopped moving.</p>
<p>‘Yeah. It’s better if the duke comes quickly. It’s good, but…’</p>
<p>Even so, I couldn’t help but feel that it’s such a shame and think that it would be better if he’d return a little later.</p>
<p>The reason was simple.</p>
<p>I hoped that the request I had entrusted to Madam Blanca would be faster than the duke’s return.</p>
<p>This investigation request was for the madam to investigate someone.</p>
<p>The purpose of this request was to first investigate them, then attract that person to me, but this didn’t mean just ‘winning their favor’ and getting them to be on my side.</p>
<p>It was literally to be by my side.</p>
<p>It meant that I needed that person to be inside this ducal estate.</p>
<p>And the best way was to let that person come in while there was mass employment for the annex.</p>
<p>Unlike Alicia, who had already chosen an exclusive maid amongst the ones hired in the central mansion, I still had that position vacant until now.</p>
<p>So that I can fill that vacancy with that person.</p>
<p>I needed a reliable person who could aid me and Cassion while being in close proximity.</p>
<p>A person, whose lips could be sealed, was loyal and could guarantee their trust.</p>
<p>Someone I could be comfortable with even if secrets would be shared.</p>
<p>And, in order for that person to be found right away, it was best to use the information from the novel.</p>
<p>The original work was there to be a guide for the characters’ personalities.</p>
<p>Thus, the person I chose was a woman named ‘Diana’.</p>
<p>So I left the investigation in the madam’s hands.</p>
<p>Diana was originally meant to be Leo’s hands and feet.</p>
<p>If I bring her in, it’s hitting two birds with one stone—getting a reliable person and stealing an ally who was meant to have been a great help to Leo.</p>
<p>However, if the duke comes back before Blanca could fulfill my request, things would get complicated.</p>
<p>As soon as the housekeeping would be back on track, the punishment of Katie, Marie and the others would begin.</p>
<p>After that, they would try to recruit new employees as soon as possible.</p>
<p>That’s why if the duke comes back, the work would be finished at a faster rate, and the deadline would be pushed up.</p>
<p>If the timing wasn’t right, I’ll have to bring her in with a ridiculous act just as I did with Cassion…</p>
<p>But honestly, I wouldn’t be able to pull that off for a second time.</p>
<p>“Huu.”</p>
<p>I sighed and walked faster back to my room, planning to write a letter to Blanca telling her to rush the request.</p>
<p>However, I ended up not needing to write that letter.</p>
<p>“Lady Rosetta.”</p>
<p>Someone called out to me, stopping me in my tracks.</p>
<p>I looked back and saw a maid bowing politely.</p>
<p>“A guest has arrived. The Larrington Bookstore has come with an item that they say is something the Lady has ordered, so they’ve requested for you to check it. What should we do?”</p>
<p>As soon as the maid’s calm explanation ended, I smiled in disbelief.</p>
<p>Really, how does she always appear with such incredible timing?</p>
<p>It’s getting a bit scary now.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 41</p>
<p>The Larrington Hotel’s fifth floor.</p>
<p>It was the first place where I met Madam Blanca and entrusted with her my first request.</p>
<p>That’s right, literally the ‘first place’. Once a customer had successfully given a request at that place, they would be able to use the services of Blanca’s guild in their other branches.</p>
<p>Bookstores, cafés, salons, etcetera, etcetera.</p>
<p>It was impossible to meet Madam Blanca in such places, but it was possible to send additional requests through those branches or to check the status of the current requests.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I sent a new request regarding ‘Diana’ under the guise of a book order at the Larrington Bookstore. That’s why what was being delivered today was not truly a book, but the status of that request thus far.</p>
<p>While sitting at the tea table for a while and lost in thought, I heard a few staccato knocks on the door.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter whether I’d go to the drawing room to meet them in person, but I called the messenger to my room just in case there were any prying eyes and ears around us.</p>
<p>‘I’ll check the book personally, that was my excuse.’</p>
<p>As I told them to come in, the door opened silently. A woman who was holding a few books entered the room.</p>
<p>“It’s nice to meet you, Lady Rosetta.”</p>
<p>I faced the woman who was bowing, her face covered by a light veil.</p>
<p>It was Blanca.</p>
<p>After she got up from her curtsy, Blanca sat opposite me. Her movements were languid. I waited for her to be seated before I propped my chin on one hand, elbow on the table. Then, I spoke.</p>
<p>“The maid said that an employee from the bookstore had come. I didn’t expect you to be here.”</p>
<p>“The Larrington Bookstore is an affiliate shop of the Larrington Hotel, so in a broader sense, the boss is also an employee. Still, I disguised myself just in case. I wore this veil before I entered through the door.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. You certainly wouldn’t have been able to pass through the main gates in such a suspicious outfit.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, what do you mean, suspicious? I wanted to see you, Ducal Princess, so I came here in person.”</p>
<p>Blanca replied in a very exaggerated tone.</p>
<p>As I glanced at her, I reached out and picked up my teacup, taking a sip of the red-tinged tea. Following my example, Blanca also picked up the teacup in front of her and moved her veil aside.</p>
<p>While the two of us were drinking tea, the room was filled with a tranquil silence.</p>
<p>Tak.</p>
<p>At the sharp sound of a teacup being set down, I faced Blanca and leaned my back against the chair.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop this farce. You’ve come today because you have something to tell me, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course. I just feel very apologetic about the delay. That’s why to compensate, I brought here results that would unconditionally satisfy you.”</p>
<p>She moved her hands, and the lace gloves over her skin appeared like butterflies in the air. One hand soon reached into the bag she brought with her, and she rummaged through it.</p>
<p>Then, after a while, she took out a few sheets of paper.</p>
<p>Even at a glance, it was clear that those pieces of paper were densely packed with small handwriting.</p>
<p>“Here’s the data that you’ve requested.”</p>
<p>Unlike her playful tone of voice, which she spoke with all the time, the hand that reached out to give the papers was polite. I took them and skimmed the writing. What caught my eyes first was the word written at the very top.</p>
<p>‘Diana.’</p>
<p>The name of the woman I was looking for.</p>
<p>Next to the name, there was a crude portrait drawing of her. I had never met her before and all I knew about her was her name, but she did have much better looks than I thought.</p>
<p>“Are you satisfied?”</p>
<p>I was distracted momentarily by the face and name, but at the Madam’s question, I read the rest of the document that’s been written in small letters.</p>
<p>‘I’m not just satisfied. This is chilling.’</p>
<p>The document had details related to ‘Diana’s family relationship’, ‘Diana’s reputation with the people around her’, ‘Diana’s upbringing as a child’, ‘Diana’s current whereabouts and lifestyle’.</p>
<p>Even her weakness, which I needed the most.</p>
<p>“…How do you know how many pieces of tableware she has at home?”</p>
<p>“Well. It’s a trade secret.”</p>
<p>If it’s a trade secret, then it couldn’t be helped. She might be acquitting information through not-so-legal means, but that wasn’t my business.</p>
<p>“Is this all of the information you have on her?”</p>
<p>I went over the three sheets of paper once again. The document had details of what I requested at first, which included ‘information on Diana’ and the ‘scenario and fake identification to let her enter the duchy’.</p>
<p>“A few days ago, I sent an additional request regarding Diana to the bookstore. Along with the fee.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You sent both the request and the commission fee.”</p>
<p>As she answered, Blanca removed the lace glove on her right hand.</p>
<p>On the fourth finger of her right hand, as her bare skin was clearly revealed, there lay a ring with a large diamond on a thin silver band.</p>
<p>It was what I sent to the bookstore the other day—the commission fee.</p>
<p>‘If she came here to show she was wearing it, then it means she accepted the request, but…’</p>
<p>“Pfft.”</p>
<p>As I tried to gauge Blanca’s hidden intentions, the prolonged silence within the room was broken by the slight sound of air breathed out. To be exact, it was close to a restrained puff of air.</p>
<p>Narrowing my eyes, I looked towards the source of such a sound.</p>
<p>Beneath Blanca’s veil, which fluttered slightly—</p>
<p>“Pfft… Ahem…”</p>
<p>The more that same sound was repeated, the more the veil fluttered. As her right hand continued to show the ring on her finger, that same hand trembled a little as it fell palm-side up on the table.</p>
<p>Still trembling, her right hand slowly began to tap the table. It might hurt her to keep doing that with the ring on, but the sound of the tapping on the table seemed to grow louder and louder, still.</p>
<p>The same was true of the sound that was coming from the veil. The sound of those restrained puffs of air gradually became clearer and clearer.</p>
<p>Soon, a lively peal of laughter began to resonate throughout the room.</p>
<p>Along with the tapping on the table.</p>
<p>Tak. Tak. Tak.</p>
<p>The ring continued to hit the table. It was a grating sound.</p>
<p>Although the person who was causing this seemed to be going crazy with laughter without a care to the world.</p>
<p>‘Is this a habit?’</p>
<p>Her laughter and this tapping on the table overlapped with my memory of our meeting at the hotel the other day.</p>
<p>Blanca laughed like this, too.</p>
<p>It seemed to be a habit.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem to be a good habit.</p>
<p>I quietly overlooked her actions and simply drank the black tea in my teacup.</p>
<p>Fortunately, her laughter quickly subsided. Perhaps she realized that she was inside a duke’s estate.</p>
<p>The thin veil fluttered in the air.</p>
<p>“Huu, I apologize. I tend to laugh a lot. It was rude of me to have laughed so hard in front of someone else.”</p>
<p>“Enough. Just tell me the reason. There must be one since you laughed so hard this time.”</p>
<p>As she hadn’t calmed down completely, her voice trembled slightly, and it contrasted greatly to my own dull tone of voice.</p>
<p>She nodded up and down.</p>
<p>So there really seemed to be a reason.</p>
<p>“How come every time, you always bring me such extraordinary requests… After I received it, it felt like I’ve been giggling for three days and three nights.”</p>
<p>Like a complete lunatic.</p>
<p>This last part was added only inwardly. This person handled many secrets.</p>
<p>And it looked like she was having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>Staring at Blanca, I carefully recalled my recent request.</p>
<p>“Was there anything to laugh about for three days and three nights?”</p>
<p>No. There shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>It was simply the plan I had concocted so that I could pull over ‘Diana’ to my side. However, I thought it would be difficult to do alone, so I asked for help through a request.</p>
<p>‘Isn’t it a rather normal request compared to what I’ve asked her to do in the past?’</p>
<p>I was left bewildered by her laughter at first, but eventually, I just nodded.</p>
<p>Right. Wasn’t it enough that those who liked to take pleasure in life should be left to enjoy it?</p>
<p>“Then, are the results of that request here?”</p>
<p>At my question, Blanca shrugged.</p>
<p>“Not exactly. I’m prepared to take you up on your request, but I just haven’t reached those results yet because I need a little help from you, Princess.”</p>
<p>“My help?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Without your help, the request would not be taken.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve left behind the details of it in between this book. After I leave, you may read it.”</p>
<p>As she said this, she tapped the book. It was one of the few that she brought in a while ago.</p>
<p>I wanted to ask why I should check after she’d leave, but I saved my question. There must be a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Currently and in many ways, I was ‘Party B’ to her in this contract between us. But wasn’t there a request of mine that hadn’t been answered yet?</p>
<p>That is, it was my request of ‘making Cassion the next duke’.</p>
<p>Now that talking about my additional request had been wrapped up, all that’s left was to talk about that. Blanca must be feeling the same way, and soon, the playful air around her gradually disappeared.</p>
<p>The atmosphere turned strange.</p>
<p>Heavy and light at the same time.</p>
<p>The tension in the air felt as though it was a battle of wits between us.</p>
<p>It was me who spoke first.</p>
<p>“Well, have you come to a conclusion regarding the proposal last time? As I can recall, the request I sent to the bookstore was a ‘pair’.”</p>
<p>My mouth was dry.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see her face from beyond the veil, so I had no idea what Blanca was thinking. From her reaction earlier, it’s reasonable to think that she had accepted the request, but making Cassion the next duke was not an easy task, and it was a sensitive one as well.</p>
<p>I was still not sure what her answer would be.</p>
<p>Again, this time, she did not respond right away. She stared at me directly for a moment, then she suddenly picked up the lace glove that she had taken off.</p>
<p>“I shall postpone my answer for a little longer. I’m not normally a person who likes to be in the center of conflict… Lady Rosetta, not only are you a source of delight for me, but you are also a source of strife. This is really… I’ve never felt this way before.”</p>
<p>As she wore her lace glove, her hand movements were as graceful as her voice.</p>
<p>It would have been better if she could utter a more positive response with that elegant tone of hers.</p>
<p>But, well. It’s not a rejection.</p>
<p>“Instead.”</p>
<p>I nodded to convey that I understood her point of view, but Blanca spoke once more and this singular word cut through the air.</p>
<p>I looked up at her face. No, to be exact, at her veil.</p>
<p>As she was now wearing her gloves properly, she faced me straightforwardly.</p>
<p>“Instead?”</p>
<p>“Instead, I’ll give you some information that would very much tempt you. It’s a story about your person, Your Ladyship.”</p>
<p>My person…</p>
<p>It was strange, hearing this for the first time. For her to say this, it was evident that she was talking about a secret relationship, correct?</p>
<p>…And that guess seemed to be right.</p>
<p>I stayed silent as I waited for her to continue what she was going to say. She was sitting upright until just now, but she slowly began to lean forward towards me over the table. Then, she whispered with a hushed voice.</p>
<p>“A funeral is being prepared.”</p>
<p>“A funeral?”</p>
<p>I asked back unconsciously. But I already knew what she meant. At this time, there was only one person around who could have a funeral.</p>
<p>“Yes. Unfortunately, the eldest son of House Carter passed away at such a young age. They’ve planned to hold a funeral before the summer ends. You’re going to attend the funeral, right?”</p>
<p>After whispering this, she quietly leaned back on her seat again.</p>
<p>‘Cassion’s funeral.’</p>
<p>I was dazed as the words popped into my head.</p>
<p>It would be special. In many ways.</p>
<p>In the novel, it was the day Leo started to pay attention to Alicia.</p>
<p>Exactly on the day of the funeral.</p>
<p>It was indeed a psychotic notion that he started a pursuit of romance at the very funeral of the half-brother he handled(?).</p>
<p>Of course, this time, he wouldn’t even reach the ‘ro’ in ‘romance.</p>
<p>I will make sure of that.</p>
<p>Even if there was a slight risk to anything, I will be sure to prevent that ‘fatal first meeting’.</p>
<p>The corners of my lips twisted crookedly. As I reached for my teacup, I tilted my head to the side.</p>
<p>“Of course, I must go. I am mourning him deeply, so I shall be there and give him one last flower.”</p>
<p>Annoyance, anger, unfamiliarity. All these emotions mixed together with anticipation, and my heart pounded momentarily—until they’d been cut off the next moment.</p>
<p>I raised the teacup to my lips.</p>
<p>The tea that had already cooled moistened my throat and flowed down.</p>
<p>Precisely, just like my emotions. Lukewarm.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 42</p>
<p>“Why are we here? Isn’t it time for you to tell me?”</p>
<p>As I heard the question uttered from behind me, I stopped walking.</p>
<p>Looking back, I saw Cassion staring at me with a grumpy expression. He’d just been steadily following me until now.</p>
<p>Well, to be exact, all I could see were his lips in a straight line because he was wearing a black mask.</p>
<p>Now that it’s been about a week since Cassion’s accident, the search for him wouldn’t be as extensive as it was before. However, there wasn’t anything bad about being cautious.</p>
<p>The fact that a week had already passed was just that—only a week had passed.</p>
<p>I looked at the black mask, about where his eyes were. Then, I opened my lips to speak.</p>
<p>“You asked me later than I thought you would, hm?”</p>
<p>Right now, we were walking along a squalid alley, and by anyone’s judgment, it was a place that exuded poverty.</p>
<p>Several dilapidated structures and tents that were too shabby to call houses. Trash rolling on the street so dirty that they’d turned black. Strange odors that permeated everywhere.</p>
<p>Usually, a dark place like this was very far from bright places, and the brightest place in the duchy’s domain was the Valentine estate.</p>
<p>Our travel time from the estate to this place had been quite long, however, in the meantime, Cassion did not complain or even ask a question.</p>
<p>When we left the ducal estate in a carriage, when I asked him to wear the mask I gave him during the ride, he asked not one question.</p>
<p>Even until we stopped by the Larrington Bookstore, escaped through the back door and walked for a long time until we reached this squalid alley.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would have asked already around the time the mask was put on.</p>
<p>At my question, Cassion did not answer.</p>
<p>All I could see were his lips in a straight line, so I couldn’t read his expression.</p>
<p>He continued to stare at me, then just took a few steps forward in order to catch up. Standing tall right next to me, he leaned down a little before he opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“You asked me to come with you, so we’re probably going somewhere we need to go. And I know you’ll tell me about it later, so I thought that it just wasn’t the ‘proper’ time yet.”</p>
<p>I blinked.</p>
<p>The stiff tone of voice he spoke with sounded like whining to me.</p>
<p>He trusted me and kept waiting, but it looked like he got sulky because I showed no signs of telling him anything.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see anything beneath what the mask was covering, but for some reason, I could tell what expression he was making right then.</p>
<p>Obviously, it was a warped expression that would match his grumbling tone.</p>
<p>I smiled slightly and pushed the man’s shoulder with one finger.</p>
<p>He had leaned down to match my height, but he now returned to standing upright.</p>
<p>“There’s someone I’m looking for here. Someone who will help.”</p>
<p>As I gradually walked forward again while answering him, Cassion matched my stride at a relaxed speed.</p>
<p>“Someone who will help… Then is it the person you talked about last time? Did you say her name’s ‘Diana’?”</p>
<p>“Well, the final objective is to get to her, but she’s not the one we’re looking for today.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>The answer to Cassion’s question lay in the note in my pocket.</p>
<p>Two days ago, when Blanca pretended to be a bookstore employee and paid the mansion a visit, didn’t she say that she needed my help for the additional request I sent before? The one related to Diana.</p>
<p>Then she gave me a book with this note in between its pages, telling me to check it later to know what kind of help she needed from me.</p>
<p>After Blanca left, I immediately opened the book. Inside, there was a veil much like the one she always wore, and beneath that was the note.</p>
<p>This was what’s written on that small piece of paper:</p>
<p>‘Two days later, wear this and go to the place marked on this map.’</p>
<p>And that map was written at the back of the note, depicting the alleys near the ducal territory’s city.</p>
<p>Amidst the depiction of winding alleys, a red line was drawn along only one alley, and the road where that red line ended was marked with stars.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the destination.</p>
<p>After checking the marked place again, I read the note once more.</p>
<p>‘Along the alley that has been marked here, buy a doll and take it with you. When you arrive at the destination, there will be someone waiting to help you regarding your request.</p>
<p>P.S. Bring your escort knight.’</p>
<p>It was impossible to know what’s going on, but I had no choice but to do as I was told.</p>
<p>The Blanca I knew was already doing her best to do the request I made. No matter how strange the instructions were, I’m sure this was going to be of assistance to me somehow.</p>
<p>That’s why I came all the way here with Cassion, and I was wearing the veil over my face just as I was instructed.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we’ve yet to find the dolls that were supposedly being sold along this alley. However.</p>
<p>“It should be here. Someone who can help me find that woman.”</p>
<p>I answered half-heartedly, looking around. Maybe the doll seller was around here.</p>
<p>‘If I go even further, I don’t think I’d even see a single ant, let alone a human being.’</p>
<p>Even though we’ve already walked quite a bit, I still couldn’t find the supposed doll seller. All we’ve come across were some people either begging on the street or selling crude flowers. Except for them, who all glanced furtively at us because we definitely looked suspicious to anyone else given that we were wearing masks and hoods.</p>
<p>‘If I knew this would happen, I should have just brought some other doll with me.’</p>
<p>Though even as I thought like this, I soon shook my head. The specific instruction was to ‘buy a doll there’, and so I should abide by those words.</p>
<p>I might have to go round and round just to fulfill this condition. Perhaps, I could unearth a hint with the doll seller.</p>
<p>“Rather than that, Maxwell, do you happen to…”</p>
<p>I trailed off.</p>
<p>Because someone suddenly appeared and stood in front of me. Fortunately, there was still some distance between us, so we didn’t bump into each other.</p>
<p>Even so, the person who suddenly popped out was such an unexpected person, seeing as they were below my eye level.</p>
<p>To make eye contact with the other person, I lowered my gaze. Quite a lot.</p>
<p>It was a small child whose height couldn’t even reach my waist. And, at first glance, it was evident just how thin and malnourished the child was.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>When I asked quietly, I could see the child’s shoulders shaking. It was uncomfortable to see because it felt like the child was scared for no reason, even if it was the child who suddenly blocked my way here.</p>
<p>“If you have nothing to say, can you stop blocking my path? There’s somewhere I need to be.”</p>
<p>As I spoke calmly, I felt Cassion’s gaze stuck on me. At that, I turned my head slightly to glance at him.</p>
<p>Then, I lifted the veil slightly with the fan in my hand, barely showing my lips.</p>
<p>’What.’</p>
<p>After mouthing the question at him, I faced forward again without waiting for the answer.</p>
<p>The child was still in the way.</p>
<p>I was thinking of just avoiding and walking ahead, but the child’s small hand began to reach down slowly.</p>
<p>And the place where those thin fingers headed towards was their own bag.</p>
<p>It was an old cloth back that looked as though it was about to break. And after rummaging through the bag, the child took out a few small dolls.</p>
<p>They were clumsily made with crude materials, and they could really barely be called dolls.</p>
<p>The child held out some dolls to me and hesitated for a moment, but eventually showed them to me fully.</p>
<p>“H… Hello. P… Please buy a d… doll.”</p>
<p>The young doll merchant let out a timid, sloppy sales pitch.</p>
<p>If it were someone else, they wouldn’t have looked twice at what’s being sold.</p>
<p>However, these words were what I’ve been meaning to hear for a while now.</p>
<p>“Okay. How much?”</p>
<p>As I asked back without hesitation, the child’s eyes shone brightly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cassion thought that it was fortunate he was wearing a mask now.</p>
<p>Otherwise, he would have been caught with a look of disbelief just about now.</p>
<p>His black eyes beneath the mask glanced towards one person silently—the woman walking next to him, Rosetta Valentine.</p>
<p>Her face was also covered with a veil, so he couldn’t see her expression. But at just a glance and even when only her lips were visible, it was clear that she was smiling.</p>
<p>Seeing her fiddling with the crude doll, she looked very satisfied.</p>
<p>“That’s unexpected.”</p>
<p>As he peered at Rosetta, he calmly opened his lips to speak.</p>
<p>The woman turned to look at him.</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>Though they couldn’t make eye contact because of the cover over both their eyes, he lowered his gaze because he felt as though that was the case nevertheless.</p>
<p>But as his gaze lingered on Rosetta’s neckline, he became momentarily flustered, so he looked back up and anchored his gaze on her lips.</p>
<p>“I thought that even if you were urged to buy it, you’d ignore the child and pass right by. Whether it’s buying something from them or giving alms, I didn’t think that you’d show compassion in such a situation.”</p>
<p>Earlier when the child blocked the road and held out the dolls, Cassion absolutely thought that Rosetta wouldn’t buy any dolls.</p>
<p>Because she didn’t seem to be interested in things that had no use to her.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he thought of her badly.</p>
<p>People had different personalities, and in his perspective, Rosetta might be cold, but she wasn’t a bad person.</p>
<p>It’s not required for a person to buy a doll that a child was selling to them, so if she had ignored the child and just passed by, he would have thought, ‘That’s just like Rosetta’.</p>
<p>But instead, Rosetta bought one.</p>
<p>And even when the child offered everything to her, she picked up only one.</p>
<p>The flustered child told her to take all the other dolls, but Rosetta patted the child on the head and said no.</p>
<p>“It’s not that I don’t want to take them. I’ll just leave them in your care for a while. So, keep them for now until I come back to get them.”</p>
<p>She spoke in such a sweet voice that Cassion could only stare at Rosetta blankly.</p>
<p>Everything she did was always unexpected.</p>
<p>That she willingly bought a doll, that she spoke so sweetly to the child, that she gave more money in such a way that the child wouldn’t feel ashamed of it.</p>
<p>To be honest, there was no reason for them to come back to this alley.</p>
<p>Of course, she wouldn’t have to meet that child again.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, as she gave more than she should have paid, it was perhaps her way of urging and comforting the child to receive the money by saying that she’d come back for the other dolls later.</p>
<p>It was odd.</p>
<p>He wondered if he hastily judged her as a cold-hearted person just because of her outward appearance.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rosetta only blinked as she heard Cassion’s question.</p>
<p>Beneath the veil, her expression became colored with surprise.</p>
<p>With the rough cloth doll in her hands, Rosetta thought,</p>
<p>‘Compassion?’</p>
<p>When did she ever.</p>
<p>Rosetta herself did not know the meaning of that word.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 43</p>
<p>For a moment, I could only blink at Cassion’s words.</p>
<p>I do understand what he meant with the first part, but what he said about ‘taking care of the child so that he wouldn’t feel embarrassed’ or something like that. What was that about.</p>
<p>What do you mean, ‘compassion’? When did I ever?</p>
<p>But I soon realized which part he misunderstood.</p>
<p>‘When I said I’ll leave the dolls to the kid, you must have thought I said that out of consideration, right?’</p>
<p>He seemed to think that I bought a useless doll and added more money for the child’s sake.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s true that I added more money.</p>
<p>When the doll seller finally appeared even after I strained my eyes for the kid this long, it was an act of gratitude rather than kindness.</p>
<p>The child who took the money offered four dolls in return.</p>
<p>However, I only needed one doll, and it’s not good to carry three more useless dolls with me.</p>
<p>The problem was that the kid insisted on giving me all four dolls.</p>
<p>He seemed to want to hand over the goods that were equivalent to as much as I had paid.</p>
<p>If you live so honestly, you’d soon find out how tiring life is.</p>
<p>I wondered for a moment if I should just get my money back, but I brushed off that idea right away.</p>
<p>It would be laughable to try and get a refund from that snot-filled hand.</p>
<p>So, I roughly handled the situation, saying that I’ll pick up the rest of the dolls later.</p>
<p>I felt a bit sorry for Cassion, who thought that he saw another side of me, but it was not an act of compassion but rather an act of annoyance.</p>
<p>But this good man’s misunderstanding, it just revealed how warmhearted he was.</p>
<p>With a subtle smile on my lips, I shrugged and patted Cassion with the fan in my hand.</p>
<p>“I’m pretty kind by nature. I have a nice face, too, and my personality’s agreeable, so don’t run away from me anymore, alright?”</p>
<p>At the peal of laughter that spilled through my lips, Cassion turned away.</p>
<p>Ha.</p>
<p>I could barely hear a suppressed exhale of breath.</p>
<p>Feeling a sense of satisfaction in many ways, I continued to walk forward.</p>
<p>After that, we went deeper and deeper into the alley.</p>
<p>The more I entered the maze-like road, the gloomier the atmosphere became.</p>
<p>Now, there could be nothing here called ‘home’.</p>
<p>Not a single sound of a simple bug or a beast could be heard, let alone a human’s voice.</p>
<p>‘I don’t think there’s any living creature here…’</p>
<p>It’s the perfect place to kill one person and sweep the matter under the rug.</p>
<p>Cassion didn’t seem to think differently. In the middle of the alley, he tapped my arm and double-checked if this was the right place.</p>
<p>Every time he did that, I’d check Blanca’s fairly detailed map and saw the characteristics of the alleyway that she had indicated, so I confirmed that we were going the right way.</p>
<p>We passed by a suspicious looking red stain and a small tree with blue leaves.</p>
<p>On the map, there was a strange drawing of a house site that seemed to have collapsed and turned to ashes.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until we had fully immersed in this dreary atmosphere that we finally reached the meeting place.</p>
<p>However, this was where the real problem arose.</p>
<p>I think we arrived at the right place, but no one was waiting there.</p>
<p>The only things to be seen were old, dilapidated walls that seemed to be on the verge of toppling over, and tall, grotesquely twisted trees.</p>
<p>I couldn’t feel any movements around us.</p>
<p>In the still silence, the sound of grass shaking in the wind sounded bleak.</p>
<p>‘Seriously. Is this really the right place.’</p>
<p>The question that Cassion had been asking me came to mind. However, this really was it. Didn’t I confirm and tell Cassion many times before?</p>
<p>‘Maybe it’s not the right time?’</p>
<p>Was the other person going to be a little late, or did we come too late?</p>
<p>The former was better. I could wait here. However, if it was the latter case, then I’d need to grab that person by the back of their neck.</p>
<p>I came all the way here, but you left without even meeting me?</p>
<p>Cassion and I stood in the middle of the vacant lot and looked around. However, when we thought that there was no sign of any movement—</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>“Rosetta!”</p>
<p>As soon as I felt that something was odd, Cassion called out to me.</p>
<p>I turned my head reflexively, and a small dagger flew by my face.</p>
<p>Fortunately, I avoided getting hurt in the nick of time, but it’s clear that the situation had turned for the worst.</p>
<p>I strained my senses to find any signs of movement.</p>
<p>But I still couldn’t feel anything. Perhaps the other person was quite talented in hiding.</p>
<p>‘This is obviously an ambush.’</p>
<p>For either me or Cassion. Or an attack aimed at us both.</p>
<p>I reached back and took Cassion’s hand.</p>
<p>When I pulled his hand, I felt his large body come closer, touching my back.</p>
<p>“Don’t move away from me. Take this chance to hide in the safest place possible.”</p>
<p>“And you?”</p>
<p>At the concern that was palpable in his voice, I chuckled lightly.</p>
<p>To be honest, the biggest hindrance for me right now was Cassion.</p>
<p>Had it not been for this man, I would have already jumped up that tree.</p>
<p>“Are you worried about me?”</p>
<p>Cassion did not answer.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, several arrows rushed in.</p>
<p>I took a slow step back, watching where those arrows came from.</p>
<p>In my periphery of that large tree, I saw a huge pile of the dilapidated wall’s debris on the side.</p>
<p>Whoosh.</p>
<p>An arrow flew in from the same direction again. I countered the arrow with the fan that was in my hand.</p>
<p>Just in case, I’m glad I hid an iron sheet on one side of this fan.</p>
<p>In my second transmigration, my weapon of choice was an iron fan, so I’m more used to fighting with this rather than a larger weapon that would elicit suspicion.</p>
<p>‘Looks like there’s only one enemy.’</p>
<p>Arrows kept rushing in from only one direction. Besides that, there’s a little pause in between each arrow that would get shot.</p>
<p>That enemy’s location was above us, at the tree right in front.</p>
<p>First, since I’ve identified how many of the enemy there were and their location, the other thing I need to know is ‘how the enemy is attacking us in this place’.</p>
<p>Did they sneak up on us from behind?</p>
<p>No, that shouldn’t be true.</p>
<p>I’m sure of it.</p>
<p>No matter how good the opponent was in hiding, it was almost impossible to completely hide their presence while following someone else.</p>
<p>And we walked for quite a long time along a winding maze of empty alleyways.</p>
<p>If someone was following us, I would have felt their presence at least once.</p>
<p>For this enemy to attack so stealthily, I had no choice but to think that this was a planned ambush.</p>
<p>‘But how did you know that we’re coming here that you were already lying in the wait?’</p>
<p>I didn’t even tell Cassion where we’re going today.</p>
<p>And the coachman of the carriage we rode earlier only picked us up from home and dropped us off in front of the Larrington Bookstore.</p>
<p>He must be thinking that we’re still inside the bookstore, as I made a point to show that we entered through the main door of the bookstore, but exited through the back door.</p>
<p>And, there was something else to ask.</p>
<p>Right now, Cassion was wearing a mask while I was wearing a veil.</p>
<p>In other words, it meant that the opponent shouldn’t know who exactly we were.</p>
<p>At any rate, if they were planning to ambush a targeted person who’d come by this place, then shouldn’t they know who they were attacking?</p>
<p>Since we’re hiding our identities with a veil and a mask, the enemy should have held their breath and waited for the moment either of us revealed our faces.</p>
<p>However, they already launched an attack without any intention of confirming our identities.</p>
<p>Ah, maybe—</p>
<p>‘Maybe… That’s the specified target.’</p>
<p>With my face hidden with a pre-arranged veil as I walk into a pre-arranged place, coming here with a pre-arranged ‘man’ with the pre-arranged ‘goods’…</p>
<p>“Ha.”</p>
<p>Laughter leaked out of my lips. This situation right now was just so funny.</p>
<p>Given the above assumptions, well, assuming that this was a trap in the first place,</p>
<p>There’s only one person who could have led us here.</p>
<p>‘…Blanca.’</p>
<p>Tak, tak, tak.</p>
<p>A sharp staccato beating seemed to echo in my ears.</p>
<p>It was the sound of gold hitting against a hard table. Then, the familiar laughter of that woman filled my head.</p>
<p>I could vividly imagine Blanca knocking against that table while laughing riotously in front of me.</p>
<p>‘And I was wondering what made you laugh for three days and three nights.’</p>
<p>That’s why.</p>
<p>Now I understand the meaning of that laughter.</p>
<p>I fell for it.</p>
<p>Blanca tricked me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This very amusing realization made me tighten my grip over the fan I was holding.</p>
<p>The doll I bought from the kid was no longer useful, so I roughly shoved it into the pocket of my dress.</p>
<p>Now that my other hand was empty, I reached back again to grab Cassion’s arm.</p>
<p>After pulling him to dodge a few times, I pulled his wrist fully.</p>
<p>“Maxwell.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>With my other hand, I kept blocking the arrows and retreated. Gradually, the distance between us and the tree where the enemy was hiding widened.</p>
<p>The farther the distance between us, the more difficult it would be to aim accurately, and the interval between each arrow would also increase.</p>
<p>Maybe that person would get down from the tree soon.</p>
<p>“Once I give the signal, crouch down.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Crouch down, and then…”</p>
<p>I pointed towards that spot near the tree that I saw in advance, the spot with the debris. Then I gave a nod.</p>
<p>It was a blind spot to anyone up that tree.</p>
<p>“Hide over there. If you think you’re in danger, just run away by the wall.”</p>
<p>“You want me to…”</p>
<p>“Enough worrying.”</p>
<p>I cut him off. I already knew what he’s going to say next.</p>
<p>‘You want me to run away alone?’</p>
<p>Something like that. However, such concern was enough from earlier. This is the real deal now.</p>
<p>I’m a bit ticked that someone’s playing a trick on me.</p>
<p>At that moment, I felt his wrist in my hand flinch, but I didn’t care.</p>
<p>I spoke in a calmer tone.</p>
<p>“To be honest, I’m more concerned about you now. There’s no guarantee that you’ll be safe anywhere you try to hide. That’s why just think about how we can get through this crisis now. Worry about me when there’s time to worry later.”</p>
<p>There was no room for emotions right here. At a time like this, a cool head would be more helpful.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t it be better to act coldly yet survive to see another day rather than act warmly towards each other and die?</p>
<p>Cassion should be thinking on the same lines.</p>
<p>I didn’t wait for his answer. Instead, I pulled his wrist closer. I need to get the timing right.</p>
<p>At last, another arrow flew past near our feet.</p>
<p>‘Now that an arrow has come, there’s some interval until the next attack.’</p>
<p>This opportunity shouldn’t be missed. Soon, the enemy would come down from that tree.</p>
<p>If Cassion would still be behind me then, there would be no chance in winning at close combat.</p>
<p>“One… two…”</p>
<p>As I began the count with a low voice, I relaxed my grip over Cassion’s wrist.</p>
<p>On the count of three, I was going to tell Cassion to go.</p>
<p>And at that moment.</p>
<p>“Three… G…”</p>
<p>However, the final signal couldn’t be said.</p>
<p>Cassion drew up—so close—leaned down towards me and whispered something into my ears.</p>
<p>As he leaned down, I could feel the man’s muscles as they touched my back.</p>
<p>His tension-filled breath soaked my ears.</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like something soft had touched my ears.</p>
<p>By the end of Cassion’s words, I heard a rustling sound from the tree where the arrows were coming from.</p>
<p>Just before the enemy came down from the tree, Cassion crouched and rushed away at just the right time, hiding in that spot.</p>
<p>Everything happened in an instant.</p>
<p>It started with the split-second when the word ‘Go’ couldn’t even be completed.</p>
<p>But even as everything happened so fast, it was all so clear.</p>
<p>Muscles, breath, soft touch.</p>
<p>And.</p>
<p>“Don’t get hurt.”</p>
<p>Even the short whisper uttered.</p>
<p>Right. It was all so clear.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 44</p>
<p>‘Don’t get hurt.’</p>
<p>Glancing at the man who left just now, the whispered words echoed and tickled my ears.</p>
<p>Yeah. I shouldn’t get hurt.</p>
<p>If I get hurt, it would only put me in a difficult spot.</p>
<p>The opponent who came down from the tree was clothed entirely in black, even his face. The only part that wasn’t covered was his eyes.</p>
<p>With that appearance, and while even doing a forward roll after jumping to the ground, he just gave the impression of ‘Yeah, I came here to kill someone today.’</p>
<p>“State your business. Why are you after us?”</p>
<p>I knew that he wouldn’t answer, but I asked this cliché question anyway.</p>
<p>And, just as expected, the opponent did not answer.</p>
<p>Instead of that, he threw away his bow and quiver to the ground, then pulled a sword from his side.</p>
<p>‘That doesn’t look like a sword that knights use…’</p>
<p>It looked about half as short as a normal sword, as if it’s just for sparring.</p>
<p>Even so, it didn’t look like something to use for training, but more for practical use. But rather than for protection, it looked like it was meant for hurting someone else.</p>
<p>In the next moment, a silent confrontation ensued.</p>
<p>I knew that they wouldn’t answer anyway, so I didn’t try to strike an unnecessary conversation.</p>
<p>Shwaaa.</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew by and rustled my hair. I turned slightly so that my hair wouldn’t block my vision.</p>
<p>I felt a bit envious of the opponent. It would be so much more comfortable to fight in tight-fitting clothes.</p>
<p>My hair was loose and blowing around me like a fan right now. There was a veil on my face, and the clothes on me was a dress.</p>
<p>‘Still, even if it’s a dress, I’m glad it’s a one-piece dress.’</p>
<p>With today’s agenda in mind, I deliberately chose a dress that I’d be able to move in more comfortably.</p>
<p>A light, accommodating dress.</p>
<p>As I thought about my choice of clothing for a moment, the enemy made his move first.</p>
<p>Kicking off the ground, his movements looked nimble.</p>
<p>I didn’t notice at first because he was crouching, but as he started to run, the opponent looked a bit short.</p>
<p>I remained still and observed the fast-approaching enemy.</p>
<p>The distance between us narrowed in an instant.</p>
<p>And, without any hesitation, the knife in the opponent’s hand rushed to my shoulder right then.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>‘Easy peasy.’</p>
<p>Was what Harron thought as he swung his sword straight to Rosetta’s shoulder.</p>
<p>The woman was just standing still right there as if her feet were rooted to the ground. She must be terrified. All she was holding in her hands was that strange looking fan.</p>
<p>Of course, he had been surprised when she managed to block his arrows with that fan.</p>
<p>But that was all.</p>
<p>She might be able to ward off arrows with that fan, but it couldn’t possibly be turned into a weapon when the fight turned into close combat.</p>
<p>What could she do with a fan that didn’t even have any sharp edges?</p>
<p>It was also so light that it couldn’t even be used to hit someone else with it as a blunt weapon.</p>
<p>Victory would not be achieved without initiative of attack, and a fan couldn’t be used as a weapon of attack at all.</p>
<p>At this point, it’s obvious who the victor was here.</p>
<p>He was a little worried about the man who looked like an escort before.</p>
<p>Two-on-one fights were troublesome.</p>
<p>But then, that escort rolled away and hid in the bushes.</p>
<p>Poor woman.</p>
<p>Why did you choose a coward for your escort.</p>
<p>Well, it was good for Harron anyway since only the woman was his target in the first place.</p>
<p>‘Let’s get this done and over with, then go get the commission fee.’</p>
<p>That’s all Harron was thinking right until then.</p>
<p>Yes—right until Rosetta, who had just been standing still, gently twisted her shoulder away to avoid his attack.</p>
<p>Instead of her flesh, the sword swung through the air.</p>
<p>‘Huh?’</p>
<p>What’s this.</p>
<p>Not even thinking of this possibility, Harron blinked for a moment.</p>
<p>However, since he was a professional, he quickly came to his senses.</p>
<p>It was a startling scene, so he was dazed for only a bit.</p>
<p>‘Yeah, I’ve been too careless.’</p>
<p>The person in front of him had dodged all his arrows.</p>
<p>‘You seem complacent just because you warded my arrows with a mere fan, but I’ll end that overconfidence with the next attack.’</p>
<p>Harron took a couple of steps back with the sword in his hand.</p>
<p>Again, Rosetta only watched as she stayed stationed in that same spot.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>The veiled woman tilted her head to the side for a moment.</p>
<p>Doubts and realizations mixed together.</p>
<p>Seeing this as an opening, Harron swung his sword once more.</p>
<p>This time, the attack was aimed at the woman’s right thigh.</p>
<p>He took advantage of the fact that her lower body was more constrained than her upper ody.</p>
<p>Besides that, because it was her leg, it would be impossible to completely avoid the blade just by twisting her body slightly like she did before.</p>
<p>She would need to move her legs quickly, but she would more likely lose her balance from doing so.</p>
<p>And a person who had lost their balance was bound to be careless.</p>
<p>Harron reached behind him using his left hand, then picked out a small dagger hanging from the belt around his waist.</p>
<p>‘Once the right thigh gets sliced, I’ll stab the left shoulder right away.’</p>
<p>The very moment that her center of gravity would shift even the slightest, that would be his opportunity.</p>
<p>However, yet again, the situation did not go as he had expected.</p>
<p>Before the edge of his sword could reach Rosetta’s leg, something solid blocked his attack.</p>
<p>‘The fan?’</p>
<p>Shiiing.</p>
<p>As soon as he checked what had blocked his sword, the sound of metal clashing against each other rang immediately. It was a sound that was out of place.</p>
<p>At the same time, under the mask, Harron’s expression became distorted.</p>
<p>“Uuurk.”</p>
<p>A low groan slipped through his clenched teeth.</p>
<p>He couldn’t overcome this force.</p>
<p>It felt as if the object that his sword had struck was a huge, solid lump of iron.</p>
<p>‘What the hell…’</p>
<p>Harron’s wide open eyes were shut because of the pain, and he checked once again just what exactly had blocked his sword.</p>
<p>Still, it was that fan.</p>
<p>‘How can a fan stop a sword?’</p>
<p>Mid swing, too? And what the hell was this pain?</p>
<p>While he was at a loss for words, Rosetta soon began to push the fan beneath his sword.</p>
<p>Taken aback by her strength, Harron clenched his teeth and tried to endure it. But it was useless. The sword, which was aiming for the woman’s thigh, quivered and was gradually pushed up diagonally.</p>
<p>Shiiing.</p>
<p>The thinly ringing sound, like the howl of an animal, tore through the air.</p>
<p>Chang!</p>
<p>Before long, as Harron’s sword was pushed back by the fan, it flew away in an instant, and the accompanying sound was loud.</p>
<p>It was an incredible sight, but all he could feel was the tingling sensation on his hand.</p>
<p>“Keugh.”</p>
<p>He clenched his sore right hand—but swung his left hand immediately.</p>
<p>There was no time to feel any pain.</p>
<p>At the unbelievable sight of his sword flying away in an arc, fear started to begin creeping in.</p>
<p>The longer he’d face this woman, the more he’d be at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>Since her body was turned to the right from blocking and sending the sword flying, he naturally aimed his left hand towards her right shoulder.</p>
<p>And to avoid that attack, Rosetta leaned back.</p>
<p>The cold blade swung over her nose.</p>
<p>Harron’s attack was packed with force, and so he stumbled because it had cut through only the air.</p>
<p>Not missing this opportunity, Rosetta straightened her posture and held Harron down at the same split second.</p>
<p>Then, she tripped him. As he lost his balance, he immediately collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>At the sight of the approaching woman, Harron closed his eyes.</p>
<p>However, he felt no pain.</p>
<p>He opened his eyes again, and at the same time as the back of his head was grabbed, his field of vision quickly turned upward.</p>
<p>What he saw was the sky.</p>
<p>And the veiled woman.</p>
<p>In that swift moment, Harron was brought to his knees while his head was tilted back.</p>
<p>Crunch.</p>
<p>Harron gritted his teeth, humiliated.</p>
<p>“Are you going to kill me?”</p>
<p>Without answering the question that he spat out, Rosetta reached towards him with her left hand.</p>
<p>And that left hand went straight to his neck.</p>
<p>His neck was covered with his thin clothes, but he could vividly feel the touch of her fingers through the cloth.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>His mouth was dry. It felt like those fingers were as sharp as sawblades.</p>
<p>Every place her fingers swept past made him shudder under unprovoked iciness and fear.</p>
<p>Ring, ring, ring.</p>
<p>The warning bells revealing the fear he felt were ringing loudly in his mind.</p>
<p>Something’s wrong with this commission.</p>
<p>It was a request that he shouldn’t have accepted.</p>
<p>He should have known it the moment he was offered such a huge amount for one request.</p>
<p>Even so, hindsight was always useless. He was already here at this point.</p>
<p>His back was numb and his fingertips were cold. He closed his eyes.</p>
<p>Then,</p>
<p>Clatter.</p>
<p>A hard object slipped through his fingers. His fingers twitched for a few times until he recalled what exactly it was.</p>
<p>It’s the dagger he was wielding earlier.</p>
<p>Harron wriggled his fingers and struggled to grab it again.</p>
<p>In spite of himself, he took it.</p>
<p>Grabbed it like a lifeline.</p>
<p>He didn’t mean to attack the woman with it.</p>
<p>Just the fact that he had a weapon in his hands gave him the flimsiest hope that he could escape.</p>
<p>It was a strange expectation to have in a situation like this—to hope, like this.</p>
<p>Unfortunately however.</p>
<p>Rosetta was greatly capable at breaking people’s false hopes.</p>
<p>“What’cha doing?”</p>
<p>A short question could be heard from beneath her veil.</p>
<p>Harron broke out in sweat, blinking back at the lighthearted tone.</p>
<p>‘Did I… get caught?’</p>
<p>He felt his heart plummet to the ground.</p>
<p>After flinching suddenly, he soon lost control over his actions.</p>
<p>Moving slowly, his glistening eyes looked up.</p>
<p>Towards the woman who asked the question.</p>
<p>This single moment felt like an eternity.</p>
<p>At that moment, the hand on the back of his head gripped with a stronger force.</p>
<p>“Huuuk.”</p>
<p>In an instant, a gasp came up his throat, and Harron let out a rough groan.</p>
<p>Rosetta leaned down further, and the distance between them became even smaller.</p>
<p>“Why are you reaching for that? Do you want to attack me again?”</p>
<p>The sweet voice of the woman could be heard distinctly,</p>
<p>As if she was whispering directly into his ear.</p>
<p>Beneath the sheer veil, he caught a glimpse of the covered red lips.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t do that, if I were you.”</p>
<p>And those red lips were shaped like a fine curve.</p>
<p>Seeing the sweet smile on the woman’s lips, Harron loosened the grip of his left hand.</p>
<p>It felt like it was all futile.</p>
<p>What’s the point of holding on to something like this?</p>
<p>Just, it would only provoke the predator’s ire.</p>
<p>The captured prey had no choice but to hold its breath while bowing down with its head stuck to the ground.</p>
<p>Please, he could only hope that the beast in front of him was a merciful beast.</p>
<p>Tak.</p>
<p>With a dull sound, the dagger in his hand dropped to the ground.</p>
<p>The dagger clattering to the dust-covered ground felt like a reflection of his own future.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 45</p>
<p>“Good thinking.”</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled as she watched the dagger skidding across the floor.</p>
<p>There were times when people would look down on someone else who’d give up quickly, but Rosetta didn’t hate seeing it.</p>
<p>Even if it was pathetic, wouldn’t it be better to survive rather than to show a bit of courage that would still lead you to your death anyway?</p>
<p>Ah, of course, that’s to say if you wanted to survive.</p>
<p>With one hand still over the back of Harron’s head, Rosetta slowly raised her other hand from their neck and away, as if she was caressing them with a lingering touch.</p>
<p>Their eyes widened as the distance between Harron and that hand gradually grew narrower.</p>
<p>However it felt as if that hand was not that of a woman’s, but like it was the fanged mouth of a monster.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>They swallowed dryly. The way their throat quivered imparted just how urgent the situation was for them.</p>
<p>“…S…Spa…re me…”</p>
<p>The stuttered words eventually became a broken sentence, yet the hand did not stop and slowly approached its goal.</p>
<p>The hand went up near Harron’s nose bridge.</p>
<p>The fingertips that touched their face were cold.</p>
<p>Harron clenched their hands into fists because the cold sensation was much too sharp, which inevitably grounded them back to reality. It would have been better if this were a dream.</p>
<p>The hand over their nose soon seized the mask covering the lower half of their face.</p>
<p>Then, it was pulled down without one hint of hesitation nor mercy.</p>
<p>Tuk. With that small sound, the knot that was tied tightly behind their hair broke without resistance, and the long, faded gray-brown hair drooped beneath the hood.</p>
<p>As their face was suddenly exposed, the lukewarm, early summer air hit them.</p>
<p>To the point that Harron couldn’t breathe.</p>
<p>Rosetta stared at Harron’s face for a long while.</p>
<p>A tan complexion and dark brown eyes, which was the most common coloring in the empire, then dry, chapped lips.</p>
<p>Well, the dark brown eyes couldn’t be seen properly because of how much their eyes were shaking—being averted in fear that their eyes might meet the eyes beneath this veil. Even for a moment, even by chance.</p>
<p>As Rosetta faced them—no, as the veil faced them—Harron felt an intense sense of fear rising within.</p>
<p>The only thing they could imagine lying beneath that veil was the face of a monster with a torn mouth.</p>
<p>Common sense would say that this was impossible.</p>
<p>However, the fact that her face was covered heightened even greater fear.</p>
<p>Whenever ghost stories were told, it was much scarier to listen to the story while imagining it yourself. Nothing was more frightening than that.</p>
<p>As the suffocating silence continued for the longest time, Rosetta nodded and muttered.</p>
<p>“…As expected, what an interesting act.”</p>
<p>Contrary to what she said was ‘interesting’, there was a subtle hint of irritation in her voice.</p>
<p>Soon, Rosetta let go of her other hand’s grasp on Harron at the back of their head.</p>
<p>Because they flinched so hard, Harron almost fell face forward.</p>
<p>Fortunately, they avoided a disaster by instinctively covering their face with their arms. But because their body was so coiled with tension, fear and fatigue, they were frozen there on the ground, gasping out heavily.</p>
<p>“Huuk… Huuk…”</p>
<p>As Rosetta glanced down at Harron with a bored look, she reached into her pocket and took something out.</p>
<p>Then, as they were still lying face down, gasping for air, she then turned to them and put that object into their own pocket.</p>
<p>At the height of fear, the man was immobile.</p>
<p>Just as though they were a deer in front of headlights.</p>
<p>Currently, Harron was in that state.</p>
<p>Harron was so uncomfortable and so terribly afraid of what Rosetta had pushed into their pocket, but they couldn’t move even a single finger because of this fear that went beyond rationality.</p>
<p>They just tried desperately again to move their arms and push themselves up so that they could find a way to escape.</p>
<p>Hitting Harron hard across the chest was a strong desire to live.</p>
<p>After shoving that thing into the collapsed person’s pocket, the woman raised herself.</p>
<p>She reached slowly towards the dagger that Harron had earlier, then picked it up.</p>
<p>Watching the woman’s movements with their breath lodged in their throat, Harron blinked.</p>
<p>They felt a hot sensation pooling around their eyes.</p>
<p>At this very moment, they suddenly wanted to see their family.</p>
<p>Someone.</p>
<p>Someone Harron had to protect… Perhaps someone else who could protect them in turn.</p>
<p>“Sa… Save… me, please…”</p>
<p>Their lips felt so wooden that they had not been able to speak all this time, but another broken sentence was formed after many pauses.</p>
<p>With a dull step forward, the woman crouched down in front of the fallen person.</p>
<p>As Harron raised their head, what they saw instantly was the woman’s hand holding the dagger, right in front of their face.</p>
<p>“Mmph!”</p>
<p>Harron closed their eyes and groaned, but as they did not feel the flash of pain that they were expecting, Harron slowly opened their eyes once more.</p>
<p>And this time, the woman’s open palm was in front of Harron’s eyes.</p>
<p>Pale, small, soft-looking palms.</p>
<p>That palm, spread out as if to show its magnificence, folded in an instant. Only one finger was left up.</p>
<p>“Now, look closely.”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>Harron could only ask back in confusion at the woman’s brief command.</p>
<p>Soon, the lone index finger turned slowly to one side, as if telling Harron to focus there.</p>
<p>Harron stared at the finger just as they were told.</p>
<p>And, apparently, there was a small wound on her finger.</p>
<p>It looked to be a very thin slice, but still, small traces of blood could be seen.</p>
<p>After seeing that Harron saw exactly what she was asking them to look at, Rosetta raised herself to her feet.</p>
<p>“You’re the one who gave me this wound. This—you did this.”</p>
<p>“This… What…”</p>
<p>“From this point on, I’ll give you thirty seconds.”</p>
<p>Rosetta spoke with a firm voice. After which, she backed away.</p>
<p>One, two, three steps backward.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, Harron staggered to their feet, just as Rosetta was leisurely distancing herself.</p>
<p>Exhausted to the bone, Harron staggered from the ground and nearly lost their balance several times, but they eventually managed to keep their feet on the ground. Harron stared back at Rosetta.</p>
<p>Arms folded, Rosetta was standing still. Then, she shook her head once, gesturing to one other side.</p>
<p>Over there, at the other side of the dead end alley, towards the only path of escape.</p>
<p>“Run.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I’ll give you thirty seconds to run.”</p>
<p>At the woman’s out-of-the-blue remark, Harron grimaced and blinked back at her.</p>
<p>Was she testing Harron right now, or was she really…</p>
<p>However, there was no time to think.</p>
<p>“Thirty… Twenty-nine…”</p>
<p>Rosetta started the countdown. Absolutely nervous out of their mind, Harron looked left and right, then soon began to step back.</p>
<p>The woman stayed rooted on her spot and did not move.</p>
<p>“Twenty-four, twenty-three…”</p>
<p>And she continued counting like a machine.</p>
<p>Harron’s backward steps gradually accelerated. Then, when there was a more significant distance between them,</p>
<p>Harron turned around and booked it.</p>
<p>The end to this encounter was something they couldn’t have expected—but the important thing here was that they got to live in the end.</p>
<p>With their back against those numbers that they could no longer hear, Harron ran and ran and ran. They did not make the mistake of looking back.</p>
<p>Right before Harron turned the corner,</p>
<p>“Bye. See you later.”</p>
<p>It felt like a small farewell could be heard.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Rosetta stood still in the same spot and tapped one finger against her forearm.</p>
<p>The gaze of her golden eyes was still on Harron’s urgently running back.</p>
<p>She followed the retreating figure until she couldn’t see it anymore. Then, she spoke up.</p>
<p>“You can come out now, Maxwell.”</p>
<p>After hearing this faint voice, rustling could be heard as one person emerged from the bushes.</p>
<p>A tall man stood up and took a step away from his cover, the rustling sound following his every movement.</p>
<p>It was Cassion, who had been hiding silently while Rosetta had confronted Harron.</p>
<p>As he walked towards Rosetta, he brushed away the rubble and leaves from his clothes.</p>
<p>Then, he looked at her wordlessly.</p>
<p>Just as she caught sight of him, she soon turned to face him.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>The question was simple, but the answer was complicated.</p>
<p>His lips, which were tightly closed for a long time, slowly spat out one unexpected word.</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>She was so dumbfounded that she laughed out loud like a fool.</p>
<p>Sorry, he said. About what though.</p>
<p>Then after a moment, Rosetta realized what he was apologizing for.</p>
<p>Her golden eyes gleamed.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem to be from amusement.</p>
<p>“What are you sorry about? Is it because you couldn’t help me just now?”</p>
<p>Her voice also expressed her bad mood.</p>
<p>Cold. With no consideration.</p>
<p>After hearing her say that, she even sounded cynical.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be strange to think that Cassion’s pride might be hurt like this. But instead of shaking in anger, he only nodded unhesitatingly.</p>
<p>“Yes. I’m sorry about that.”</p>
<p>The face beyond the mask also gave a plain answer.</p>
<p>At the time that Rosetta had been attacked, Cassion merely crouched down by himself over in those bushes.</p>
<p>Whenever the opponent wielded his blade, it felt like Cassion’s heart was about to plummet. And whenever Rosetta successfully avoided the opponent’s attack with her fluid movements, Cassion breathed out a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Even though he had to suppress that very breath in his throat so that he wouldn’t make a single sound.</p>
<p>Again and again, he wanted to run out.</p>
<p>He was the only one hiding in safety, and he felt so sorry that Rosetta had to deal with this situation all by herself.</p>
<p>Wasn’t it a little strange?</p>
<p>Wasn’t she sacrificing herself too much?</p>
<p>He and Rosetta were on the same path towards one goal, yet it was always him who hid and Rosetta who helped him.</p>
<p>However in the end, despite these thoughts, he couldn’t bring himself to run out.</p>
<p>His righteousness was unnecessary as he was too weak to help. All he could do was simmer in regret and misery.</p>
<p>The worst-case scenario here was for a powerless person to try and help, yet eventually become a hostage.</p>
<p>Rosetta would have told him the same obvious fact, that’s why she told him to hide.</p>
<p>So, without acting out in presumption, Cassion focused on the one thing he could do to help in this situation.</p>
<p>He silenced his movements and his breaths. It was a matter of life and death.</p>
<p>He might not be actively helping, but he at least should grit his teeth and stay put so that he wouldn’t become a burden.</p>
<p>It wasn’t easy for him to come out even when the enemy had shown his back and ran away.</p>
<p>Just in case, he didn’t know if the enemy would turn around again and try to take him hostage.</p>
<p>Then at last, when safety was guaranteed once more, his duty ended and he was able to come out from his hiding place.</p>
<p>Cassion awkwardly brushed off the dirt from his pants.</p>
<p>Those traces of his desperation to hide.</p>
<p>“It’s laughable to say this, but honestly, I’m not ashamed. I hid because I know I’m weak, and as a result, I didn’t get in the way. That in itself is enough already. However…”</p>
<p>Right. Even so.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that I had to make you go through that alone. I’m sorry I couldn’t help.”</p>
<p>As the overly honest confession flowed out, Rosetta’s uncomfortable expression gradually returned to its original neutrality.</p>
<p>In the first place, the reason she felt offended was because she was worried that Cassion was feeling ashamed.</p>
<p>It didn’t matter that he was ashamed of his current level. It was a good jumping off point for when he started improving his skills.</p>
<p>However, she knew that it was difficult to hide and he might feel ashamed about the fact that she was the only one who fought.</p>
<p>For him to hide because he was weak.</p>
<p>And to be protected by a stronger individual.</p>
<p>There was nothing to be ashamed of about this. No, it was only obvious that there shouldn’t be.</p>
<p>If you’re strong yet still ran away from someone weak, then go ahead and be ashamed. But someone who had to hide shouldn’t be feeling the same way.</p>
<p>Being fraught with such emotion would only bring out negativity.</p>
<p>A sense of inferiority, for one.</p>
<p>And oftentimes, an inferiority complex could destroy not only the individual, but also the people around them. That was the kind of person that Rosetta disliked the most.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Rosetta loved Cassion’s honesty and candor.</p>
<p>‘Fortunately, I was just overreacting.’</p>
<p>In a much better mood now, Rosetta smiled lightly.</p>
<p>Then, she slowly approached Cassion.</p>
<p>“Why are you sorry about that? I don’t want you to feel apologetic towards me.”</p>
<p>Speaking in a calm tone, Rosetta reached out towards him. Without any hesitation, she reached behind his head.</p>
<p>Fingers brushed across his earlobe and plucked out a dry leaf.</p>
<p>Because Cassion was leaning forward to brush off the dust in his pants, he looked up in an instant.</p>
<p>The eyes beneath that mask began to glow red.</p>
<p>Her fingertips felt so hot against his skin.</p>
<p>His shaky gaze then turned towards the dry leaf between the woman’s fingers.</p>
<p>“You know, each and every person has their own shortcomings. No one’s born perfect, that’s why we all keep striving to improve throughout our lives. To make up for those shortcomings.”</p>
<p>Her slender fingers twirled the leaf around.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 46</p>
<p>The slight turn of the leaf made it look as though it was dancing.</p>
<p>“Throughout this all, you’ll inevitably still need to ask for help from other people. It’s nothing for you to feel apologetic about, nor is it something that you should be ashamed of.”</p>
<p>And as though it was a matter of course, these words fell atop Cassion’s shoulders and calmly settled.</p>
<p>“Besides, I’m going to work you to the bone just so you can be strong. So, stop being sorry. There’s plenty of time to cry bitter tears later.”</p>
<p>At the playfully added words, Rosetta grinned.</p>
<p>The wind blew by just in time, and the veil fluttered along.</p>
<p>Beneath that veil and behind her cascading silver hair, he could see a part of her nose and one corner of her lips turned up to a curve.</p>
<p>Then, he saw her golden eyes.</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>
<p>With an unidentified feeling dawning upon him, Cassion blinked.</p>
<p>Strangely, he was glad to see her.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been able to see those golden eyes for the last day—no, not even half a day had since passed.</p>
<p>It’s weird. He was so glad to see her eyes again that his heart started beating oddly.</p>
<p>Really. What a peculiar thing.</p>
<p>He couldn’t believe that he started missing her when he just hadn’t been able to see her face for just about half a day. And he was so relieved now, too.</p>
<p>More than that, hadn’t she been beside him, talking to him all this time, too?</p>
<p>Really. Did it make sense that he was now feeling so glad to see her face?</p>
<p>He realized that this was really, truly something uncharacteristic of him.</p>
<p>All his life, he had always been alone, and so it was natural that he had gotten used to loneliness.</p>
<p>Instead of that, when the hell did it become natural for him to stay beside this woman?</p>
<p>“Okay. Go ahead and work me to the bone.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I will be strong. Even more than you want, I’ll get stronger. So go hard and work me to the bone. I won’t feel sorry.”</p>
<p>His voice was calm and solemn. Each syllable he uttered was so sincere that his intention could be conveyed with such clarity towards the other person.</p>
<p>“I won’t feel apologetic, not one bit.”</p>
<p>As he added this, Rosetta blinked.</p>
<p>Somehow, this made her feel weird. It’s like she heard a confession just now.</p>
<p>Even though it wasn’t about something like that at all.</p>
<p>“Uh… Sure. Fine. I’ll work you to the bone.”</p>
<p>Hearing Rosetta’s answer, Cassion nodded firmly.</p>
<p>Then, a moment of silence stretched between them.</p>
<p>Rosetta continued to absentmindedly twirl the leaf between her fingertips, then she soon turned it towards the direction where the attacker had fled.</p>
<p>And a sudden thought dawned upon her—it was amusing how they were just standing face to face at an alley like this.</p>
<p>If not that, perhaps it’s because this brief silence was strangely burdensome.</p>
<p>It’s been a long while since any silence ever became burdensome. Rather, it felt unfamiliar.</p>
<p>Sometimes, unfamiliar things felt ticklish, too.</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go.”</p>
<p>Saying this in a hurry, Rosetta walked out through the exit first. Cassion quickly caught up with her.</p>
<p>“Are we going back?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Ah, before that, there’s somewhere we need to stop by.”</p>
<p>“Where? No, wait, can we just let them go like that?”</p>
<p>“Mmh, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“What if they come back and try to attack you again? Don’t you think it’s better to capture that person now while there’s only one of them?”</p>
<p>At Cassion’s question, Rosetta shook her head.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. Even if we let them go now, we’ll meet that person again.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“No matter where we go, we’ll bump into them sooner or later. So let’s hurry up and leave. We have to be there first and wait for the other person.”</p>
<p>Rosetta shrugged while saying something cryptic.</p>
<p>She was much too relaxed for someone who had just been attacked a few moments ago.</p>
<p>Actually, even when she spoke so ambiguously like this, the strange tickle was still there.</p>
<p>As Cassion glanced at her with a puzzled expression, he inevitably shrugged like Rosetta and didn’t question it further.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, people’s emotions were infectious. If you look at what just happened objectively, they were in a rather urgent situation, but…</p>
<p>Seeing Rosetta be so composed like this, Cassion also felt that he was starting to feel more calm.</p>
<p>“Good thing we left early today. Right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Cassion nodded in response to Rosetta’s cheery question.</p>
<p>Despite coming out from an ambush, both individuals felt lighter on their feet.</p>
<p>Truly, what a strange turn of events.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at around the same time.</p>
<p>Unlike the two who felt light on their feet, the retreating attacker’s steps were not at all light.</p>
<p>“Huuk… huk…”</p>
<p>It felt like their legs were about to burst from all this running. They were so out of breath that it felt like they were going to lose consciousness any moment now.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Harron could not stop.</p>
<p>That fear remained clamped over their heart.</p>
<p>‘She won’t chase after me until this far…’</p>
<p>Harron had been running nonstop for almost a quarter of an hour now, and after leaving the winding back alleys behind them, they finally got a chance to catch their breath.</p>
<p>Huuk, huk…</p>
<p>The heaving gasps that scratched at their throat were hot.</p>
<p>Sweat poured down from them like rain. There was no place on their body that didn’t hurt.</p>
<p>As Harron rubbed their wrists and ankles, they thought.</p>
<p>‘Ah, I couldn’t complete the commission in the end.’</p>
<p>It felt like the money they lost today was floating around over the cloudy sky.</p>
<p>Harron looked blankly into the air with a slightly bitter look. Then, they let out an even more bitter laugh.</p>
<p>It was laughable, this situation.</p>
<p>Harron wanted so desperately to survive, but as soon as they could finally breathe again, here they were, thinking about how regrettable it was to have let money slip right through their fingers.</p>
<p>Just as they thought about every coin wasted, now even the price of their life was a waste.</p>
<p>Even so, it was inevitable that Harron was feeling this way.</p>
<p>The reward for this commissioned request was absolutely staggering, and right now, they urgently needed that money.</p>
<p>‘…What should I do about Ria’s treatment now… Should I borrow money from the guild master?’</p>
<p>What broke the silence around Harron was a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>Harron had a younger sister named ‘Ria’. She’s a poor kid who was born with a rare disease.</p>
<p>To those of the lowest social class, sickness was nothing but a shackle.</p>
<p>If any ordinary person would get sick, the possibility of death would loom. But if a poverty-stricken person got sick, then every single day was an ongoing battle between life and death.</p>
<p>Since their parents left the world early, Ria was solely Harron’s charge, and they were just managing to get by to purchase the needed medicine.</p>
<p>Then Harron joined the current guild they were part of.</p>
<p>It’s the only place that supplied the medicine that actually improved Ria’s condition. And at the same time, Harron earned money at that guild.</p>
<p>It certainly sounded like the guild was their benefactor, but that wasn’t necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Harron had borrowed money from them before. When they first found out about the place, they were just trying to buy medicine, but they didn’t have any money.</p>
<p>With an agreeable expression, those people lent Harron money—yet passed down a ridiculous interest.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, Harron worked hard, yet earned very little.</p>
<p>Half of their paycheck went to their younger sister’s medicine, one quarter went towards paying off the debt, then the last quarter went towards the incurred interest.</p>
<p>In the end, the only money that had been able to pass through their hands was chump change that was barely enough to keep the two siblings from starving.</p>
<p>It was a life of just living day by day.</p>
<p>However, even with a bottom-of-the-barrel life like this, they could still reach the worst depths.</p>
<p>“Seems like the price of the medicine will go up sometime soon.”</p>
<p>This unilateral notice was given to Harron only a few months ago.</p>
<p>The already expensive medicine was going to be even more expensive.</p>
<p>It wasn’t due to a lack of effort. Harron became a more valuable worker over time, and the commission fees they earned for their requests rose, too. But at the same time, the price of the medicine was raised as well, leaving Harron no room to breathe.</p>
<p>“You can’t do that!”</p>
<p>Even as Harron tried to stand in defiance, it was of no use.</p>
<p>The only thing that came back after that was a harsh retaliation.</p>
<p>Gradually, the quality of the requests that came to Harron also deteriorated.</p>
<p>In the beginning, the kind of jobs they got were along the lines of secretly delivering parcels or escorting someone until a certain destination.</p>
<p>Most of the time, they were covert missions…</p>
<p>But as the days went by, they were given more commissioned requests like stealing, robbing, fighting, getting into a brawl among others.</p>
<p>Every time Harron accepted terrible requests like that, a sense of guilt always lingered in them.</p>
<p>This guilt weighing down on Harron made them want to defy and rebel against it all, but as long as they had to pay for Ria’s medicine and as long as there was a debt to be settled, then Harron’s body was not their own.</p>
<p>A choice. That was a privilege for those who were not poor.</p>
<p>That’s right. Privilege.</p>
<p>If only one day passed when Harron’s younger sibling was not given her medicine, then she would go back and forth between life and death. When Harron was the older sibling of a child like that, they couldn’t dare enjoy that privilege.</p>
<p>That’s why, as Harron tediously repeated the same tasks every day, even the guilt they once thought was unbearably heavy became nothing but a dull feeling.</p>
<p>In the middle of it all, that’s when this request came in.</p>
<p>“This woman here, ambush her.”</p>
<p>The client was a tall man.</p>
<p>He held out a piece of paper with details of the woman’s features and many other things about her.</p>
<p>Silver hair. Has a man accompanying her.</p>
<p>She’s going to be wearing a veil on her face, and she would be at a certain location at a certain time.</p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it, it really was suspicious…’</p>
<p>As Harron recalled this memory, their heavy eyelids blinked.</p>
<p>No, actually, they found it to be sketchy even back then.</p>
<p>However, they just tried to suppress this nagging feeling because they had been offered a ridiculous amount of money for this request alone.</p>
<p>Besides, they figured that their life wouldn’t be in danger for this mission.</p>
<p>One man and one woman.</p>
<p>Due to the experience they’d accumulated over time, Harron arrogantly thought that two targets wouldn’t be a problem at all.</p>
<p>It was of no exaggeration to say that Harron’s overconfidence was entirely laughable.</p>
<p>“Twenty-four, twenty-three…”</p>
<p>It was a tempting, saccharine voice, and yet it was a voice that was so frightening that Harron had been utterly overcome with the urge to cover their ears.</p>
<p>As the numbers went down, their chest got heavier and heavier, making it difficult for them to breathe.</p>
<p>Even though it was just a voice that they had already left behind, it arrested them in such fear as though they were being licked by the tongue of an enormous beast.</p>
<p>The whole time they were running away from her, Harron could almost hear the ‘ttak, ttak, ttak,’ of a beast’s fangs biting down, chasing after them.</p>
<p>Just thinking about that now made their heart pound so much.</p>
<p>Shutting their eyes very tightly, Harron breathed in, breathed out, and repeated the process. Then, they slowly rose from the ground.</p>
<p>Harron must return to the guild and confess that the mission was a failure.</p>
<p>‘I’m going to get hit a few times… I hope it won’t be painful enough that it’ll interfere with work tomorrow.’</p>
<p>Trudge, trudge. Taking a few powerless steps forward, Harron suddenly stopped in place. They felt the weight in their pocket.</p>
<p>They recalled only now that the woman had shoved something into their pocket earlier.</p>
<p>Harron forgot about it because they’d been preoccupied with running away.</p>
<p>Soon, they reached into their pocket and pulled out what’s inside.</p>
<p>But their hand paused all of a sudden the moment they touched it. Even their labored breaths stopped altogether.</p>
<p>This person who momentarily forgot to breathe slowly re-opened their eyes.</p>
<p>In that hushed stillness, there was but one movement.</p>
<p>“…Ha.”</p>
<p>In the end, because they needed to breathe, Harron opened their mouth and practically vomited an exhale.</p>
<p>They had stopped in place just until now, but they soon turned around.</p>
<p>They started heading towards not the guild, but towards the alleys once more.</p>
<p>As they turned around, Harron began to march forward without thinking.</p>
<p>Ta-dak, ta-dak, tak, tak, tak.</p>
<p>Those first few slow steps gradually accelerated, and eventually, they soon broke into a run.</p>
<p>Their body was as heavy as lead, but this time, they did not stop moving.</p>
<p>Rather, it was so hard not to cry out at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 47</p>
<p>After rushing through the alleys, Harron stopped in front of an old house, which had a warped red door that was slanted.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, they knocked on the door.</p>
<p>Bang, bang.</p>
<p>“Ria! Ria!”</p>
<p>Amidst the tense shouts, Harron felt as though their insides had been set on fire.</p>
<p>Their hands continued to shake as they rummaged through their pockets for the front door’s key, but the door squeaked open.</p>
<p>Through the tears in their eyes, Harron saw their little sister’s face as the door was opened.</p>
<p>“Uh…”</p>
<p>“Ria!”</p>
<p>Harron swung the door all of a sudden and stepped quickly into the house.</p>
<p>They collapsed to the floor while holding their scrawny younger sister in their embrace, letting out a huge sigh of relief.</p>
<p>This was a sunless house where the sun’s rays did not reach even when it was high up in the sky.</p>
<p>“W-Why are you… Did something happen?”</p>
<p>Confused by the sudden situation, Ria patted Harron on the shoulder and asked her older sibling.</p>
<p>After Harron confirmed that their sister was unscathed, they felt all the tension in their body being released.</p>
<p>Then, behind that relief was worry and anger.</p>
<p>“You! What’s this! You made this, right?!”</p>
<p>Harron stopped hugging Ria and lowered her, then they opened their hand.</p>
<p>The entire time they ran back here, there was something in their closed fist.</p>
<p>A crude, shoddy doll with white hair.</p>
<p>“Urk.”</p>
<p>The moment she saw the doll, Ria trembled like a child who had been caught doing something wrong.</p>
<p>With her wide, round eyes shaking, she tried to gauge Harron’s temper.</p>
<p>This alone was enough of an answer.</p>
<p>Tears welled up.</p>
<p>Harron felt their throat clench up with a burning sensation. At this, they gulped dryly and suppressed their emotions.</p>
<p>“I, I told you not to do that anymore! And what if you get sick… Besides that, you know that this is a dangerous alley, right? What if you get into trouble while you’re out alone!”</p>
<p>As Harron tried to hold back their tears, their voice grew even louder in volume. As Harron’s scolding continued, tears also began to well up in the child’s wide eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m… I’m sorry… Still, still, Big Sister’s friend was the one who bought it!”</p>
<p>The child murmured this like an excuse.</p>
<p>Harron’s head grew colder and colder.</p>
<p>“Friend?”</p>
<p>Harron blinked at the unfamiliar word.</p>
<p>She had no friends. Friends were a luxury, so she never had any or ever tried to befriend any in the first place.</p>
<p>But still, what friend?</p>
<p>“Ah, right! Big Sister’s friend even brought some food and came over to visit! Over there!”</p>
<p>Ria expressed the unfairness she felt through her cries of indignation, then she suddenly raised one hand and pointed towards somewhere.</p>
<p>However, Harron couldn’t turn her head to see where her younger sister was looking.</p>
<p>Her head was frozen in place.</p>
<p>It felt like even the sweat running down her spine was going to become drops of ice.</p>
<p>Her eyelashes began to tremble. Her closed jaw was also quivering.</p>
<p>Slowly, Harron’s head turned. Towards the direction Ria was pointing at.</p>
<p>Her movements were so stiff that it seemed like her neck was that of a broken doll’s.</p>
<p>With a shaky gaze, the figures in the dark began to come into view.</p>
<p>There were two.</p>
<p>One sitting, the other standing.</p>
<p>The former was a woman, and the latter was a man.</p>
<p>Her heart started beating like crazy. To the point that she felt so suffocated by the pounding of her chest.</p>
<p>“…Y…You…”</p>
<p>Prompted by the question so tinged with fear, the woman raised her hand.</p>
<p>And what’s in her hand was a fan that was gently waved in the air.</p>
<p>“Hello, Harron.”</p>
<p>Harron’s back straightened as she heard the relaxed greeting.</p>
<p>Once again, that sensation.</p>
<p>That terrifying sensation that felt as if an enormous beast was licking Harron’s back while she was right in front of its wide-open mouth.</p>
<p>“I-It can’t be.”</p>
<p>While Harron was unable to say anything and could only gulp dryly, the woman’s voice cut through the air again.</p>
<p>“But instead of Harron, should I call you Diana?”</p>
<p>An eerie gentleness stained with venom.</p>
<p>Diana came to a realization.</p>
<p>She had touched something that she shouldn’t have touched.</p>
<p>A black swamp, a black mire.</p>
<p>Even if you realize later and try to get out, the more you struggle, the deeper you’d fall.</p>
<p>The hand holding onto Ria tightened.</p>
<p>“Ria, can you go out for a minute? Big Sis just has to talk to her friend for a little bit.”</p>
<p>Diana tried to suppress the tremor in her voice as she said this.</p>
<p>She didn’t want Ria to worry about anything.</p>
<p>However, contrary to Diana’s wishes, the anxiety she was feeling could hardly be hidden.</p>
<p>Emotions that could not be easily hidden were easily read by the one next to you.</p>
<p>The child’s eyes soon got wet.</p>
<p>“Big Sister…”</p>
<p>“It’s alright. I’m not angry. Don’t go anywhere dangerous and just stay by the door. Count to 100 five times over, okay?”</p>
<p>Facing Ria, who was calling her anxiously, Diana had a broad smile on her face.</p>
<p>To the extent that the corner of her lips were so stiff.</p>
<p>“What do you say? You can wait, right?”</p>
<p>Hearing the lively tone in Diana’s voice as she asked again, Ria nodded.</p>
<p>The child was unsteady on her feet as she walked towards the door.</p>
<p>Diana turned her head to watch Ria’s back until the end.</p>
<p>Her sister might turn around any time, so Diana had to keep the curve on her lips intact.</p>
<p>Ka-chak.</p>
<p>It was only after the door closed behind the child that the lips drawn up into an arch finally fell down.</p>
<p>Outside the door, the child’s voice could be heard faintly as she counted, ‘One… Two…’</p>
<p>Certainly, this reminded Diana about the countdown she had heard just a while ago.</p>
<p>Before the number even reached ten, Diana got on her knees.</p>
<p>And begged.</p>
<p>“Please spare me.”</p>
<p>The resolute voice and countenance that was once there could no longer be seen.</p>
<p>“You’re quick on the uptake, aren’t you.”</p>
<p>“I apologize profusely. Please spare me.”</p>
<p>Rosetta’s words of admiration were followed by the same pleas.</p>
<p>Diana repeatedly said those same two phrases, as though all she knew to say were ‘I apologize’ and ‘Please spare me’.</p>
<p>Watching this from beneath the veil was a cold gaze.</p>
<p>“Someone might misunderstand that I’m here to kill you, hm? I’m the one who almost died though.”</p>
<p>The same was true of the voice that flowed through those red lips.</p>
<p>Diana shuddered as she shook her head quickly.</p>
<p>“…I didn’t mean to kill you, ma’am. It’s just, I received a commissioned request to ambush and hurt you a little…”</p>
<p>“And didn’t you ambush and hurt me?”</p>
<p>Diana clenched her teeth together as she was cut off mid-sentence.</p>
<p>The woman wasn’t wrong, so Diana had no excuse. When the other person involved pointed out her crimes this way, it felt so heavy and terrifying.</p>
<p>Still, Diana couldn’t stop begging for her life.</p>
<p>“Forty-one… Forty-two…”</p>
<p>Even at this moment, the small voice leaked through the cracks of the door.</p>
<p>Previously on her knees, Diana bent down entirely flat on the floor.</p>
<p>Thud! A loud bang echoed from the floor.</p>
<p>Rosetta smiled faintly as she felt Cassion flinch.</p>
<p>It’s like she was watching a horror movie with a kid beside her.</p>
<p>“If you spare my life, you can cut off my arms and legs. If you’re not satisfied with that, you can come and kill me later. But right now… Please let me live. If I die, my younger sister will die, too.”</p>
<p>“…You have quite the cruel image of me inside your head. One arm, one leg. And then you’re asking me to take your life?”</p>
<p>“No… No, ma’am. That’s not what I meant…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’m not very partial to killing anyone. If I do that, then it would just fuel some horrible nightmares. I’m only here to offer you a proposition.”</p>
<p>The humming voice was indifferent.</p>
<p>Truly, as though she had no intention to kill Diana.</p>
<p>With her tearful eyes blinking back, Diana asked.</p>
<p>“Pro…position?”</p>
<p>“Mmh. In a way, you could call it a threat though.”</p>
<p>As Rosetta said this with a lilting tone, she slowly reached behind her head.</p>
<p>Then, with the slightest movement of her hand, the veil covering her face slid down.</p>
<p>Diana’s gaze chased down the veil that felt like a petal.</p>
<p>Slowly going down along the length of Rosetta’s body, Diana looked up at the exposed face at the same time the veil touched the ground.</p>
<p>“…Huk.”</p>
<p>She gasped out, yet this breath got stuck in her throat.</p>
<p>Within those eyelids that were curved into crescent moons, glimmering golden irises were revealed.</p>
<p>That color was known to everyone in the whole empire.</p>
<p>‘Valentine… Duchy…?’</p>
<p>Similarly, it was also a known fact that this household was a bloodline that not any criminal should dare cross.</p>
<p>‘What have I done… Who did I just attack.’</p>
<p>“Diana.”</p>
<p>Completely pale with shock, Diana’s mind was filled with only that noble household’s name until her own name was called,</p>
<p>“You, Diana, how about you become my maid?”</p>
<p>Followed by words that Diana would have never been able to expect.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Maid?”</p>
<p>“Yes, my maid.”</p>
<p>‘Just what is happening here.’</p>
<p>Even after one question and one answer had gotten exchanged, Diana couldn’t easily comprehend what kind of situation she was in exactly.</p>
<p>It’s only natural to think this way, considering how strangely this all was.</p>
<p>Diana had been commissioned to ambush the ducal princess.</p>
<p>But then, that ducal princess was now giving Diana a job offer as her maid.</p>
<p>Just what kind of turn of events was this?</p>
<p>In the ensuing silence, her suspicions remained unanswered, yet this just made her shrink even more.</p>
<p>However, she couldn’t stay silent forever.</p>
<p>“I… There are many things that I don’t know, I can’t even read well. I am not good enough to dare work as a maid for a lady of noble birth. I don’t understand why someone like me is getting an offer for a position such as this.”</p>
<p>‘A maid in a ducal household.’</p>
<p>It sounded as sweet as honey.</p>
<p>Even so, the world was not always so sweet in the end.</p>
<p>Just thinking about the guild master who pretended to be nice and gladly gave her money, it was difficult not to think cynically.</p>
<p>“To someone who loves secrets, it’s not such a disadvantage for you to be a little unpracticed when it comes to reading.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I need you. You’re nimble and quick on your feet, your hands are fast, too. You’ve got quick wits about you, and besides that, you’re fiercely loyal.”</p>
<p>“I have never in my life followed anyone’s will. That’s quite a leap of judgment, ma’am.”</p>
<p>Diana called Rosetta’s unwarranted conviction as ‘a leap’, but it really wasn’t.</p>
<p>In the original work, this was already a proven fact.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 48</p>
<p>In the original novel, Diana was an assassin of the highest class.</p>
<p>Light on her feet, fast with her hands, and had very sharp wits. She was that kind of assassin.</p>
<p>This was the result of failing to overcome the soaring prices of her younger sister’s medicine, and she eventually had to go down a darker path.</p>
<p>It didn’t seem like she had killed anyone yet at this time, but…</p>
<p>‘At this rate, she’s going to start killing people in the near future.’</p>
<p>In any case, as an assassin, she later became entirely loyal to Leo and served him as his hands and feet. The reason for that was simple.</p>
<p>It’s because Leo cured Ria of her illness.</p>
<p>Amongst House Carter’s items on which they had conducted magical research, it just so happened that there was one such item that could cure the rare disease Ria was suffering from.</p>
<p>Leo offered it to Diana, and the medicine had an exceptional effect on the child.</p>
<p>Truthfully, it was a stroke of luck.</p>
<p>As it was still being studied, the potion was incomplete and could still have had side effects.</p>
<p>When Leo gave that medicine to Diana, it was only intended to be a ‘clinical test’ in the first place.</p>
<p>Diana, in the end, did not know the truth behind this.</p>
<p>Blind to the truth, for her, Leo was entirely just the ‘savior of my little sister’.</p>
<p>And Diana was someone who would do anything for her benefactor.</p>
<p>“It’s not a leap. You will be deeply, exceptionally loyal. Because you love and care about your sister very much.”</p>
<p>As Rosetta was thinking about the original novel for a while, she smiled and replied like this.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Diana couldn’t smile at all.</p>
<p>In fact, she also knew about her own sharp senses.</p>
<p>When she had to survive from the bottom of the pack, she had no choice but to have these senses.</p>
<p>And, with that sharp wit, she realized that Rosetta’s words clearly had an underlying meaning.</p>
<p>That being said…</p>
<p>“Just now, what you’re saying… Are you saying that you’re taking my sister hostage?”</p>
<p>She asked the question, yet no answer returned right away as she stifled her breaths.</p>
<p>The silence was suffocating.</p>
<p>She was so nervous because the silence could be interpreted as both a yes and a no.</p>
<p>Diana’s fingers curled onto the floor.</p>
<p>And her fingernails scratched through the rough, arid surface.</p>
<p>“Before I came here, I found out a few things about you…”</p>
<p>“Pardon?”</p>
<p>“I heard that you’re working for one of those shady guilds? And that you borrowed money there for your sister’s medication.”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s hushed question, Diana blinked.</p>
<p>‘You found out something like that in such a short amount of time?’</p>
<p>Perhaps it was only natural for her influence over information to be that powerful because she was a ducal princess.</p>
<p>Whenever she confirmed once more the monster-like aspects of the princess, Diana’s heart just tightened up even more because of anxiety.</p>
<p>She was already going crazy from worry for Ria, who was still counting alone outside the door.</p>
<p>Soon, however, these emotions shattered and dispersed into the air.</p>
<p>“That medicine. It’s fake, you know.”</p>
<p>Despite how offhandedly she delivered this fact, Rosetta’s words were absolutely shocking to Diana.</p>
<p>“…What… are you…”</p>
<p>If words had a tangible form to them, Diana would have collapsed from them by now.</p>
<p>It felt as if she’d been hit on the back of her head with a massive blunt weapon.</p>
<p>“From what I gathered, it has effects like a painkiller, and your sister said she felt like she’s getting better, right? That’s only because she can’t feel the pain. Besides the temporary anesthetic effect, there is a side effect that would make your sister’s body gradually deteriorate. Perhaps even, she could lose her life any time soon.”</p>
<p>“Lies…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t the bottom of her eyes becoming yellowish brown little by little? Her hands are shaking, and her tongue is becoming a strange color, too, I believe… It’s been a while since she drank the medicine, yes?”</p>
<p>Every time Rosetta recited the symptoms one by one, Diana could see her little sister’s face flashing though her head.</p>
<p>The deepening shadows of the yellow-brown hue under her eyes, her hands that trembled frequently. Even her pronunciation sometimes turned unintelligible.</p>
<p>‘Now that I think about it, these symptoms didn’t appear until she was drinking the medicine…’</p>
<p>As Diana thought about this, she jumped up from the ground.</p>
<p>Blood was oozing from both of her knees when she had hit the floor with a loud thud earlier.</p>
<p>However, she felt no pain at all.</p>
<p>She wouldn’t feel any pain in her body. She was seething with blind rage.</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do?”</p>
<p>At Rosetta’s question, which she asked with the same calm demeanor, Diana replied in a voice that slightly betrayed her restlessness.</p>
<p>“I’ll have to pay them a visit. I have to know if it’s true. If it is, then I’ll kill them all.”</p>
<p>At the frank remark that held not a trace of falsehood, Rosetta nodded back. Then, she asked again.</p>
<p>“How?”</p>
<p>“That…”</p>
<p>Hesitating at that point, Diana trailed off.</p>
<p>She also knew that she wouldn’t be able to do it.</p>
<p>“You cherish your life though. Don’t you have to protect your sister? If you go to a place like that alone, then you know fully well which side will perish.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t refute any of it. Because she knew that what Rosetta said was correct.</p>
<p>At that moment, what swept through her entire being was a sense of helplessness, resentment, fury.</p>
<p>That anger boiled within her and became lodged at her throat.</p>
<p>That hot, acrid sensation prickled at her throat and around her eyes.</p>
<p>“If you join my side, then I’ll help you. Whether it’s revenge or looking the other way. Whatever it is that you wish.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“And, I’ll help you find the real medicine for that child.”</p>
<p>Hearing Rosetta’s offer, Diana shook her head in disbelief.</p>
<p>Even now, she still couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Why.</p>
<p>“Why… Why would Your Ladyship go that far for me? I am no one.”</p>
<p>In response to her genuine confusion, Rosetta raised her eyebrows.</p>
<p>The people that she was trying to help thus far were only the kind of woeful people who wouldn’t take goodwill as goodwill at its face value.</p>
<p>People who wouldn’t easily trust others and who wouldn’t easily trust this world that really could not be depended on—the kind of people who lived their lives only by surviving.</p>
<p>Well, it’s not bad to be suspicious of others.</p>
<p>After all, wasn’t it that Rosetta was trying to win over both Cassion and Diana for her own agenda?</p>
<p>Rosetta looked to the side slightly.</p>
<p>There in her periphery, she saw Cassion’s fingertips.</p>
<p>Then, looking back towards the front again, in that tense silence, Rosetta slowly rose from her seat.</p>
<p>The two people’s gazes met.</p>
<p>“I want you. I am someone who invests that much in the people I want.”</p>
<p>As Rosetta said this, she began to walk forward.</p>
<p>Ta-dak. Ta-dak. Ta-dak.</p>
<p>The sound of her footsteps echoed in the small shanty.</p>
<p>The sound of stifled sobs. The sound of footsteps.</p>
<p>In the midst of that unbecoming harmony, Rosetta’s aloof voice rang through.</p>
<p>“I will be the roof over your head. I will be the foundation to your shelter. The floor, the walls, the bed, the food. Whatever else it is, I will be that for you.”</p>
<p>Strangely, this indifferent tone was more comforting.</p>
<p>There were times when a tone like this would echo more greatly inside one’s heart.</p>
<p>“Either during the day and even during the night, I’ll let you live amidst brightness. Both you and your sister.”</p>
<p>Without a single exaggeration. Just, she would give what she had mentioned.</p>
<p>“At the world’s behest, if you’re supposed to roll over like a dog anyway, wouldn’t you rather roll over under the care of someone who can be your shelter?”</p>
<p>She was not a warm person, but this at least, she could give. She was someone who would keep her word.</p>
<p>“For being my hostage, your sister will receive support and protection from me. As long as you do not betray me, that is.”</p>
<p>Because it was a small house, no matter how slow she walked or how narrow her steps were, Diana and Rosetta soon faced each other in close proximity.</p>
<p>There, as close as they were when they had confronted each other in the alley.</p>
<p>“That is all I require of you—that you do not betray me.”</p>
<p>With Diana’s eyes brimming with tears, Rosetta patted her on the arm twice.</p>
<p>As if telling her, you’ve gone through so much, you’ve worked hard until now.</p>
<p>At the emotions she was feeling for the first time, her tears eventually fell down from Diana’s eyes.</p>
<p>Rosetta walked past the sobbing woman and towards the door.</p>
<p>Ta-dak.</p>
<p>Rosetta’s steps stopped as she faced the door.</p>
<p>“Ninety… Ninety-one… Ninety-two…”</p>
<p>With a small voice, the child could still be heard counting.</p>
<p>Perhaps five times had already passed.</p>
<p>Even so, the child did not come back into the house.</p>
<p>Just as the child’s small voice could be heard from the inside, she would have also definitely heard what was being said from the outside.</p>
<p>Even if she couldn’t hear the details of that conversation, even a child could tell that it was not a very pleasant situation.</p>
<p>“One hundred.”</p>
<p>Finally, the last of the countdown came from beyond the door. However, it was uncertain which round this was.</p>
<p>At the same time, Rosetta pushed the door. As it loudly squeaked open, Rosetta saw the child squatting on one side, sobbing as well.</p>
<p>Ria glanced up as she felt the door open, then looked at Rosetta who appeared before her.</p>
<p>“One hundred… I… counted it all…”</p>
<p>Hearing the child speak through her tears, Rosetta smiled warmly.</p>
<p>“Mm-hmm. You’re very good at counting, aren’t you.”</p>
<p>A gentle palm stroked Ria’s head.</p>
<p>A gesture that said there’s nothing to be afraid of.</p>
<p>Soon afterwards, Rosetta crouched down and held the little girl in her embrace.</p>
<p>The scrawny child was as light as cotton candy.</p>
<p>Rosetta patted the child on her emaciated back, then she turned to nod at Diana.</p>
<p>“I’m taking this little one as my hostage now. Because no matter how much I think it over, I really do want you. Now then, what will you do? Will you follow me?”</p>
<p>At the question that held not a hint of a jest, Diana dropped her head.</p>
<p>She had lost both her parents at such a young age, and ever since then, she had been protecting her younger sister all by herself.</p>
<p>Without her, she knew that Ria would not be safe. So, all this time, she had obsessively been protecting her.</p>
<p>But strangely enough…</p>
<p>Ria looked so safe in that woman’s arms, despite how slender Rosetta was.</p>
<p>Even Diana herself wanted to hold onto that slender hand and beg for her protection.</p>
<p>If she were to be honest with herself, this life she was living was so tiresome— daunting.</p>
<p>She, too, wanted to have someone who would protect her.</p>
<p>She was tired of this old house, tired of being hungry, tired of being looked down on, tired of being so poor.</p>
<p>Diana slowly bent down.</p>
<p>And bowed her head.</p>
<p>Towards the woman who would be her shelter—the woman who would take her younger sister hostage.</p>
<p>“I will gladly go with you, Princess. Please accept me.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 49</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After all the conversations ended.</p>
<p>The four of us hit the road right then.</p>
<p>Diana packed a small bag with belongings and followed behind us. Since she was trying to appease Ria, who was surprised by the sudden development, she was following from a small distance away as she carried the child.</p>
<p>Before we knew it, the sky had already turned yellow and red.</p>
<p>I’m glad that we went out early. If we didn’t, it would almost be too late.</p>
<p>‘Or is it too late already?’</p>
<p>If they were to go straight to the bookstore like this, then they would be able to go back home by nighttime already.</p>
<p>For someone who supposedly only stepped out to go to a bookstore, too much time had passed. As expected, she hated having suspicion cast on her.</p>
<p>However, it was a needless apprehension.</p>
<p>As we were about to emerge from the alleyway, two carriages appeared side by side in front of us.</p>
<p>They looked like ordinary wooden carriages, but the materials used to build them looked luxurious. Wasn’t it normally the case that the discreetly luxurious items were the ones that truly held value?</p>
<p>Those carriages were just like that.</p>
<p>Cassion and Diana paused, alert at the sudden appearance of the carriages. But as I gave a nod, I approached the carriage.</p>
<p>Because, roughly, I could think of one person behind this.</p>
<p>“OH?!”</p>
<p>But then a sudden exclamation of realization burst out from behind me.</p>
<p>Turning my head slightly, I saw that Diana was looking at the coachman with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Soon, her brown eyes blazed with blistering flames.</p>
<p>She gently set down Ria to the ground and jumped right in front of me.</p>
<p>It was a quick, unnecessary movement.</p>
<p>“Be careful, Princess. That’s the man who entrusted me with the commissioned request.”</p>
<p>Diana whispered to me in a seething tone.</p>
<p>Seeing her like this reminded me of a loyal dog who was being wary in front of a stranger. A small smile tugged up on my lips at this.</p>
<p>I patted Diana’s tense shoulder.</p>
<p>Then, she nervously glanced behind at me.</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>“What? But…”</p>
<p>I walked past the dazed Diana. Then, my eyes met with the man sitting on the horse-drawn carriage.</p>
<p>A man with dark green hair and grayish green eyes.</p>
<p>“We’ve met before, correct?”</p>
<p>In response to the question, the man took off his hat and bowed to me.</p>
<p>“The Madam is waiting inside the carriage.”</p>
<p>As soon as his polite tone rang out, the carriage door suddenly opened.</p>
<p>Unlike the ordinary exterior of the vehicle, the interior was simply luxurious.</p>
<p>The owner of such a carriage was sitting on one of the soft-looking seats inside.</p>
<p>The woman turned her head and looked this way, but I couldn’t see what kind of expression she had on because of the veil covering her face.</p>
<p>“Blanca.”</p>
<p>As I called her name, the woman waved her hand and responded.</p>
<p>“Hello there. I’m here to pick you up.”</p>
<p>In any case, this woman really had a knack for infuriating people.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There were two carriages in total, so we had to split up.</p>
<p>Blanca and I rode the carriage in the front because we had to talk, so Cassion, Diana and Ria rode the second carriage together.</p>
<p>‘I wonder if it’s awkward there.’</p>
<p>Cassion was quite reserved with strangers, while Diana was also definitely wary around people she didn’t know.</p>
<p>‘Well, I’m sure they’ll be fine on their own.’</p>
<p>It’s sometimes better to raise people through grit.</p>
<p>More importantly, I had to focus on this woman sitting opposite me.</p>
<p>The carriage slowly started moving forward.</p>
<p>As I leaned against the soft seat behind me, I opened my lips to speak.</p>
<p>“So, to what do I owe the pleasure of meeting you here? Are you here to confirm whether I’m dead or alive?”</p>
<p>“Gosh, what are you talking about? I just came to pick you up because I thought you might have gotten tired.”</p>
<p>The ridiculous lie made me laugh. Her shamelessness was the best in this world.</p>
<p>What, you came here to pick me up just because you thought I was tired? Who exactly was the one responsible for tiring me out today?</p>
<p>“My, what lovely consideration. From the very person who launched an ambush at me.”</p>
<p>“Are you angry?”</p>
<p>“I’m not angry, I just find it absurd. Who in their right mind would be pleased to have been suddenly attacked.”</p>
<p>Faced with this indifferent response, Blanca let out a muffled grunt.</p>
<p>She held a hand to her chest and shook her head in excitement.</p>
<p>It’s as if she was rubbing it in that I was faced with an unfair and difficult situation, the way she was laughing again right now.</p>
<p>As her veil swayed gently from her movements, it looked like a beast’s spiteful tail.</p>
<p>If there’s someone out there who had low blood pressure, I’d offer this seat to them this instant.</p>
<p>Their blood pressure would surely rise at once.</p>
<p>“Gosh, really. Even so, don’t be too angry, Princess. In the first place…”</p>
<p>Suddenly halting in her movements, Blanca leaned forward slightly and spoke like this.</p>
<p>At first glance, it seemed like her mood had dampened, but the voice behind the veil expressed an emotion far from it. In that quiet tone, a hint of mirth could still be heard.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it you who made this request?”</p>
<p>A hint of secrecy as well.</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>Then, silence ensued.</p>
<p>Heated pressure filled the carriage, but it soon cooled.</p>
<p>I can’t see her eyes, but I could feel our gazes meeting in the air.</p>
<p>I stared at her wordlessly, but I averted my eyes first and looked out the window.</p>
<p>“Yes. I did.”</p>
<p>Through the window, I saw the scenery pass by. However, it wasn’t very impressive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Blanca was right.</p>
<p>Just as she said, as I was the one who commissioned a request with her, I was also the cause of that attack. From the very moment I started planning to take away power from Leo by making Cassion the duke, I also coveted Diana.</p>
<p>In the original novel, Diana was a great subject towards Leo, and it could be said that she was the equivalent of a thousand troops.</p>
<p>If one were to have her, then they’d have her talent at their disposal. But on the contrary, if one were to lose her, then they’d gained a formidable enemy.</p>
<p>Inevitably, I had no choice but to bring Diana to my side.</p>
<p>That’s right. By any means possible.</p>
<p>For me, ‘that’ was what the request was.</p>
<p>‘Leave a request at Diana’s guild and make her commit a crime against me.’</p>
<p>I needed an indisputable insurance against her—insurance that I could use to blackmail Diana into bringing her to my side just in case my proposition towards her wouldn’t work.</p>
<p>I’ve yet to receive this information about Diana from Blanca, but I already knew that she had a sick younger sister and that she was working in a shady guild so she could earn some money to buy her sister’s medicine.</p>
<p>The more significant the character was with regard to the narrative, the more of their past was included in the novel.</p>
<p>Diana was Leo’s most useful tool.</p>
<p>It was only inevitable that her past was also detailed.</p>
<p>So, that’s how I knew where Diana was working and that I could commission a request from her, and I asked Blanca to play the role of the ‘person who made the request’.</p>
<p>I didn’t know exactly where the guild was, but Blanca should have found it during the background check she conducted.</p>
<p>She was able to strike two birds with one stone in this way.</p>
<p>Even so…</p>
<p>I didn’t expect to get hit on the back of the head like this.</p>
<p>I reached forward and pulled the curtains. As darkness fell around us in an instant, the mana lamps all over the carriage’s interior lit up automatically.</p>
<p>Blue flames danced from all directions.</p>
<p>Blanca’s purple hair stood out amidst the flickering blue flames.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s right to say that I was the one who requested it. But I asked you to make her commit a crime against me, not for her to aim for my life.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that she should aim for your life either. I just asked her to do a tiny little ambush. And to hurt you a little.”</p>
<p>Ambush.</p>
<p>This word was extremely, ridiculously unpleasant to hear.</p>
<p>If a person has entrusted you with a request, shouldn’t you at least tell them when, where and how the request would be fulfilled?</p>
<p>When sending someone out to a meeting place without telling them anything about an attack like this, then it’s true that it’s nothing but an ‘ambush’.</p>
<p>What would have happened if Cassion got hurt?</p>
<p>What if I didn’t recognize that it was Diana and ended up killing her in the skirmish?</p>
<p>“You should have told me when and where the ambush was going to happen.”</p>
<p>“If I told you that, you might not have acted accordingly. When you’re left in the dark, that’s when a realistic reaction comes out.”</p>
<p>Hearing her brazenly spew out these words with that three-pronged tongue of hers, I furrowed my brows.</p>
<p>I bet that if Blanca were to fall in the deep waters, her red lips would still somehow float to the surface.</p>
<p>“Amazing, so that’s your sincere excuse. Seems like it truly is your principle not to lie.”</p>
<p>“I do keep my principles. It’s just that I didn’t elaborate. I never lied to you.”</p>
<p>Her confident tone reminded me of our last meeting.</p>
<p>When I asked her about the arrangements for this commissioned request, Blanca replied like so.</p>
<p>‘Not exactly. I’m prepared to take you up on your request, but I just haven’t reached those results yet because I need a little help from you, Princess.’</p>
<p>‘Without your help, the request cannot be fulfilled.’</p>
<p>And, the note that she left between the pages of that book went like this.</p>
<p>‘Two days later, wear this and go to the place marked on this map.</p>
<p>Along the alley that has been marked here, buy a doll and take it with you. When you arrive at the destination, there will be someone waiting to help you regarding your request.</p>
<p>P.S. Bring your escort knight.’</p>
<p>“Ha. That’s right, you didn’t lie.”</p>
<p>I nodded as I acknowledged the way she worded it.</p>
<p>Indeed, as Blanca mentioned, she did not lie.</p>
<p>She just didn’t elaborate.</p>
<p>“I’m glad you’re running an information guild instead of something else. If you had turned out to be a crook, then all the noble houses of this empire would have already gotten sucked dry.”</p>
<p>“Oh my, thank you for the compliment.”</p>
<p>“Did you plan for me to buy Ria’s dolls?”</p>
<p>“Children are usually vulnerable to the people who hand out favors to them. Besides that, you’d need some bait when you’d go to that girl’s house later.”</p>
<p>“And what if I bought another kid’s doll?”</p>
<p>When asked, Blanca burst out into another peal of laughter as if she heard an absurd question.</p>
<p>“Didn’t I already take care of that in advance?”</p>
<p>The answering tone was truly flabbergasting.</p>
<p>Seriously, who could be as ridiculous as her.</p>
<p>‘Still though, this is within what I’ve expected.’</p>
<p>Truthfully, I didn’t realize that the child who sold me the doll was Diana’s sister.</p>
<p>During the skirmish when I found out that the attacker was Diana, that’s also the moment I realized Blanca’s little prank and subsequently realized who ‘Ria’ was as well.</p>
<p>However, Blanca already seemed to have foreseen that I would lure Diana in with that doll.</p>
<p>Without realizing it, I’d been moving under the script that Blanca had written.</p>
<p>‘It’s not a pleasant feeling.’</p>
<p>“Haha. Really, please don’t be too angry, Princess. It all worked out in the end, so it should be alright. This will never happen again from now on. I’ll offer my hotel as a guarantee.”</p>
<p>It was when I stopped responding to her that Blanca finally apologized.</p>
<p>No matter how much I think about it, it seemed like she was just doing all this to get a rise out of me because my reactions amused her.</p>
<p>My head was throbbing from the onslaught of fatigue.</p>
<p>Now that the predicament with Diana had been solved, I just want to go home, wipe my feet on a mat, and head straight to bed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 50</p>
<p>“As much discourtesy as I’ve shown today, I also bring you good news.”</p>
<p>With my eyes closed, I had one hand over a throbbing temple. Blanca was the one who opened her lips first after being silent all that time.</p>
<p>It was the same playful voice that I hadn’t heard in a while.</p>
<p>“Good news?”</p>
<p>Brooding over Blanca’s words, I opened my heavy eyelids.</p>
<p>Beyond the shadow of gleaming lashes, I saw Blanca sitting upright.</p>
<p>As she was under the light of the blue flames, the woman gave off an even more peculiar atmosphere than ever.</p>
<p>It matched her perfectly as someone from a secret information guild.</p>
<p>“I’ll be giving you the answer that I had put off from the other day.”</p>
<p>At the elegant, whispering voice, my heart started to pound.</p>
<p>If it’s the answer she had put off from the other day, then it could only mean it’s ‘that’.</p>
<p>Laughably enough, it was at this moment that all my fatigue melted away.</p>
<p>The discomfort I’d been feeling—as if I was a marionette being pulled at the strings in a well-organized puppet show throughout this absurd day—vanished all together.</p>
<p>Instead of explaining, Blanca moved her hand instead, and this only made my anticipation and the tension in the air rise.</p>
<p>Her hand brushed underneath the veil. Then, with the veil cascaded over the back of her hand, she slowly lifted it up.</p>
<p>This time, my heart pounded in a different sense.</p>
<p>It felt like I was about to see a unicorn.</p>
<p>While I did see her face the other day at the hotel, that was only when she was posing as an employee. She likely changed her hair and eye color with a magic tool.</p>
<p>So, this was going to be the first time I’d ever see her face.</p>
<p>And, in the original novel, there was not one description of her face.</p>
<p>Below the piece of fabric, what was exposed to my eyes first was a pair of red, luscious lips.</p>
<p>When she smiled, she showed a set of white teeth, which looked unusually sharper than that of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Then, a high-bridged small nose appeared. Then, slightly freckled cheeks…</p>
<p>Lastly, I saw her eyes.</p>
<p>The shadow of the hand on the veil was cast down on those eyes.</p>
<p>And under that gray shade, silver eyes that were more clandestine than the shadows glistened.</p>
<p>‘Silver eyes…’</p>
<p>It was an unusual eye color that was not easily found anywhere in the empire.</p>
<p>No. Rather than a color that couldn’t be easily found, it was a color that wouldn’t be found at all.</p>
<p>Because having silver eyes could mean only one thing.</p>
<p>‘Witch.’</p>
<p>That’s what ostracized mages from other countries were called.</p>
<p>Silver was the unique eye color that witches had.</p>
<p>‘Come to think of it, people from other countries also say that they have jagged teeth, too…’</p>
<p>As I blinked dazedly at the unexpected identity behind that veil, Blanca curled her eyes.</p>
<p>Like two silver crescent moons in the night sky.</p>
<p>Glancing lightly at me with her gleaming eyes, she opened her lips to speak.</p>
<p>“The proposal you gave me last time, I accept. Cooperation—let’s do that.”</p>
<p>It was at this moment that I gained the most reliable partner for both the ‘Mob-Alicia Project’ and the ‘Cassion as the next Duke Project’.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Rosetta and Cassion went back home first.</p>
<p>Because it was already late, a proper conversation between Blanca and Rosetta had to be postponed until later.</p>
<p>Anyway, Rosetta had with her a crystal ball she could use to contact her, so they’d be able to talk any time after this.</p>
<p>It was decided that Diana and Ria would stay at the Larrington Hotel before they officially entered the ducal estate.</p>
<p>As Blanca introduced the room to the two siblings, she also introduced herself.</p>
<p>Though there was still vigilance from the fact that Blanca was the one who made it so that Rosetta had been ambushed, it was also taken into consideration that Blanca was now on Rosetta’s side.</p>
<p>And since Diana had already given her favor to Rosetta, it was sufficient in the end.</p>
<p>Blanca also told Diana that Rosetta was the one behind the request, which Diana understood.</p>
<p>No, well, she was moved because she misunderstood.</p>
<p>‘Just to bring me back, you had to do all that, go through so many things!’</p>
<p>Meanwhile,</p>
<p>Blanca laughed riotously after seeing just how touched Diana was.</p>
<p>Anyway, only interesting people were around interesting people, was what she said.</p>
<p>However, unlike Blanca who felt only excitement, the others were worried about the situation.</p>
<p>“Is it really alright?”</p>
<p>The carriage driver asked. He was the one who had steered the carriage Blanca and Rosetta were, and was the person who visited Diana and commissioned her to ‘attack Rosetta’.</p>
<p>Logan.</p>
<p>He was Blanca’s loyal retainer, her reliable right-hand man.</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>At Logan’s worrisome question, Blanca asked back with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>Logan replied with an uncomfortable look.</p>
<p>“For you to accept a request like that from the Prin… no, I mean the customer. You usually never agree to such a request.”</p>
<p>Indeed, it was just as Logan said.</p>
<p>Blanca had never agreed to such a request in all her life.</p>
<p>It was a first for her to have a hand at something so large-scale, and it was also a first for her to maintain a partnership with someone else.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>There was nothing she particularly found regrettable or concerning.</p>
<p>“The agreement is limited to two years, and I can still continue receiving requests from other people. Of course, the frequency will have to be decreased a little.”</p>
<p>Well, it didn’t matter whether the requests she could take were reduced.</p>
<p>She started this line of business for the sake of entertainment in the first place, and right now, it was Rosetta and her groups that was giving her the greatest entertainment.</p>
<p>It’s clear that fulfilling Rosetta’s request was bound to be more thrilling than ten trifling requests.</p>
<p>And besides…</p>
<p>‘Rather than that, there’s another reason as well.’</p>
<p>Blanca leaned back against her seat and closed her eyes. Darkness then shrouded her view.</p>
<p>That darkness was like a canvas to her.</p>
<p>Across that empty darkness, Blanca began painting a man’s face.</p>
<p>The finished portrait was more of a shadow than a face.</p>
<p>As time passed, the face that she could see only in her mind gradually lost the details and remained now as just a blurred afterimage.</p>
<p>Searching through the afterimage of that man, Blanca opened her lips.</p>
<p>“Logan. Aren’t you curious?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>It was a sudden question, but Logan wasn’t in the least bit surprised.</p>
<p>He had already adapted to Blanca’s unpredictability.</p>
<p>It was that period of time when the face of that ‘man’ had paled inside her mind.</p>
<p>Precisely then, Logan stood by Blanca’s side during that time, so it was only natural.</p>
<p>Lifting her eyelids gently as they were tightly closed before, Blanca replied.</p>
<p>“When the Second Young Master of House Carter comes to realize that he wouldn’t be able to take the seat as the next Duke, I wonder how his expression would change?”</p>
<p>It was a riddle-like statement, but Logan nodded calmly.</p>
<p>“…Yes, well. It’s up to you, Madam, so I’m sure you’ve thought of all the possibilities.”</p>
<p>The answer would sound soulless to anyone who’d hear it, and at this, Blanca guffawed.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, she became fixated on another line of questioning.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, it’s strange.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Madam?”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about my partner. How did she become such a fun person? Apparently, she wasn’t like that until recently…”</p>
<p>Logan agreed with Blanca.</p>
<p>A lot of information circulated in the basement of the Larrington Hotel, and this included some information on high-ranking nobles.</p>
<p>For any information guild, the aristocrats were both a large clientele and a large source of demand.</p>
<p>House Valentine was of the highest class amongst nobility, so of course they also had much information on Rosetta.</p>
<p>This record started from the very moment she entered the Valentine Duchy.</p>
<p>And, according to that record, Rosetta wouldn’t have been able to hold Blanca’s attention up until just a month ago.</p>
<p>After some deliberation, Logan opened his lips.</p>
<p>“Everyone has a period of growth in their lives where their personalities change. One’s personality can change even after being shocked by nothing. And with the recent incident in the Duke’s estate… Could it be that her change was influenced by that?”</p>
<p>Hmm.</p>
<p>Blanca let out a faint hum.</p>
<p>What Logan said made sense, but she wasn’t convinced.</p>
<p>Hwick, hwick. The blue gloved hand spun the rather long pen handle around.</p>
<p>The pen handle, which swung around between her fingers like a fish, slipped on the soft glove’s cloth and flew into the air in a swift instant.</p>
<p>Yes. Flew.</p>
<p>Instead of falling right back, the pen handle continued to fly along a path.</p>
<p>Then, it slowly returned to Blanca’s grasp.</p>
<p>If it was from her native country, this was called ‘witchcraft’, while if it was from the empire, it was called ‘magic’.</p>
<p>As the pen handle returned to her hand, it continued to spin around as she thought vacantly.</p>
<p>‘It’s not just that her personality changed… It feels like something more fundamental had changed.’</p>
<p>And the fact that she wanted to make Cassion the next duke so suddenly was also strange.</p>
<p>‘Perhaps an heirloom was invoked?’</p>
<p>Valentine. Carter. Freesia.</p>
<p>Each of the three ducal households had a family heirloom that was handed down to them.</p>
<p>These family heirlooms dated back to the founding of the empire.</p>
<p>The period before the Kham Empire had been established was an era of war and strife.</p>
<p>In the midst of the endless wars, God gave a revelation to the purest and wisest man—‘Choose three lions to end the wars.’</p>
<p>The person who received this revelation was the first Kham, and the three people he chose were the first Valentine, Freesia and Carter.</p>
<p>And respectively, each of the chosen three were in their own league when it came to swordsmanship, divine power and magic.</p>
<p>They used their strength to end the wars just as the revelation of God had mandated.</p>
<p>The endless cries ceased to a halt, all the blood that flowed like a river had disappeared.</p>
<p>After a long period of chaos, peace finally came.</p>
<p>The God who loved humans was then touched after seeing the new world where innocents were not anymore sacrificed, and so He bestowed upon the three families these gifts.</p>
<p>For House Valentine, a book of aspirations that could make one’s wish come true. For House Carter, a stone of a dragon that’s said to make it possible for one to meet a dragon and learn its wisdom.</p>
<p>And, for House Freesia, a mirror of revelation that could give one a glimpse into the future.</p>
<p>These gifts could only be used by one person from each generation…</p>
<p>‘Maybe, what if the Princess used that relic? If that’s the case, then the sudden change of personality…’</p>
<p>As Blanca thought this, she eventually shook her head.</p>
<p>Her assumptions were wrong from the beginning.</p>
<p>Each heirloom responded only to the blood of a descendant who had reached their coming of age, and the princess’ birthday wasn’t until late autumn. No—winter.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was impossible for Rosetta to use the heirloom as she had yet to become an adult.</p>
<p>Blanca contemplated for a while, but she soon decided to put an end to her curiosity.</p>
<p>“Right, well, it’s not something to worry about. Whatever it is, as long as it’s fun.”</p>
<p>Longer trains of thought would only set off her mind to a complicated spiral.</p>
<p>What’s important here was that Rosetta’s change was making her very happy.</p>
<p>As she had boarded this ship, would it sink, or would it reach its destination and bring her wealth in the end?</p>
<p>What would be the end of this story, she wondered.</p>
<p>Right, well. That’s enough questions.</p>
<p>Blanca hummed and bobbed one foot up and down.</p>
<p>The pen handle, which had stopped moving for a moment, swam once more, between her fingers.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That moonlit night,</p>
<p>In a small clearing surrounded by a dense thicket of trees.</p>
<p>t/n: i chose the word ‘witch’ for Blanca since it makes more sense for the novel’s western worldbuilding, but the more accurate translation for it is ‘shaman’.</p>
