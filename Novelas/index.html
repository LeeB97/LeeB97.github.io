<p>I encountered several leaders who praised themselves as kings. Even if they didn’t use the title ‘king,’ the way they governed was essentially the same. The same went for Deborah. However, all of this was only possible because this was a lawless area, not Earth. Of course, Peter knew the truth. He could be considered one of the most knowledgeable of all Awakened if someone only thought of people’s status in the outside world. Deborah recalled what Peter said before entering the field.</p>
<p>“The order established in the world is all derived from the Great Odin, and that is why I said it depends on his decision.”</p>
<p>They had gone back to square one.</p>
<p>“Tell me everything that you’ve been hiding,” Deborah insisted.</p>
<p>The anger that had raged inside Peter when Deborah had initiated this conversation instantly died down.</p>
<p>He responded, “I was a journalist.”</p>
<p>People only cared about each other’s status in the outside world at the beginning of the Stage of Advent. Therefore, Deborah had only found out that Peter was a Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist after hearing it from Odin. However, she had a rough idea because he was good at inciting others. He had even instigated her, who used to close her mind.</p>
<p>“You have won the Pulitzer Prize, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>He shrugged. “Then, they contacted me. They needed people like me.”</p>
<p>Her eyes narrowed. “Who are they?”</p>
<p>He smiled sardonically. “What about you? When you think about yourself, what was your place in the outside world?”</p>
<p>Deborah replied casually, “I was in a relatively high social hierarchy until the Day of Advent.”</p>
<p>The businesses and assets she had at the time were incomparable to her current power as an Awakened. As Odin mentioned earlier, if the association guaranteed freedom and safety, then she had opportunities to rebuild her social position. However, no one could buy an Awakened’s ability with money.</p>
<p>Peter then said, “Then you might have heard of them, the Bilderberg Club.”</p>
<p>Deborah nodded. That name was like a cloud of smoke as if it was an old memory.</p>
<p>“Most people would have thought of them as a mere conspiracy theory, but the group actually existed. Their meetings determined the state of the world.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you were one of them?” she asked curiously.</p>
<p>Peter’s lips quirked. “Financeman, industrialists, politicians. Everyone knew them by their faces as they appeared in official events, but there were a few who influenced the world with writings like me. I worked for them. The privilege I received from them was incomparable to the benefit I enjoyed here. It was much better. Very much.”</p>
<p>Peter smiled with his teeth showing, then it turned into an insidious smile. His voice quieted down with a silent laugh. “However, I’m sure you have never heard of Jeonil Club. I am a hundred percent sure because that was my job.”</p>
<p>Deborah frowned slightly. “Jeonil Club?”</p>
<p>“The Bilderberg Club was destroyed by one person. The Jeonil Club is one that was built by putting the Bilderberg Club as a base. It was created by one person. He swallowed the world by himself. You won’t be able to believe me that the whole world is under one man’s rule, but it truly is” explained Peter.</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. “Odin.”</p>
<p>Peter nodded. “Yes, he is the owner of the Jeonil Club. Jonathan Hunter and Joshua von Karjan are his loyal dogs. Others like the president and prime minister are also under him.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “That is a surprise. That story would change everything.”</p>
<p>Only by hearing that could Deborah understand that Odin was in a higher position than Jonathan Hunter. She couldn’t believe it. Things had reversed at one point. The Stage of Advent felt real, and the outside world felt like a dream. That was why Deborah’s tone was calm.</p>
<p>She speculated, “If Odin becomes an emperor, then we will become kings. Do you think that is possible? Odin might have different intentions.”</p>
<p>“He has also gone through the Stage of Advent. He might not have felt the need before, but he might want it now.”</p>
<p>Peter recalled De Gaulle’s death. Odin had slaughtered him without blinking an eye like an absolute emperor of the Final Stage. He had burst the other man to death without leaving any flesh behind. Moreover, Joshua von Karjan and Jonathan Hunter had been born anew. They no longer looked like they did before the Stage of Advent, and they were now ruthless and armed supermen. They could bring the fragile human beings on the outside to their knees.</p>
<p>“What if he doesn’t want that?” Deborah asked again.</p>
<p>Peter shook his head. “The outside world is not only dark, but they also need a de facto ruler. Gates open there too. There are so many reasons for him to do so. Yes. If he doesn’t want that, then we will have to change his mind.”</p>
<p>Odin’s lover, Mary, always had a grim smile that smelt of blood. Jonathan Hunter always seemed to be outraged. Joshua von Karjan, of course, was a bloodthirsty man. Peter was confident that he’d be able to make allies with all of Odin’s other aides besides Lee Tae-Han.</p>
<p>He coaxed her, “We can rule the world under him, Deborah. It’s less risky than the previous plan.”</p>
<p>Deborah’s lips twisted. “I guess that’s the best choice we have, right?”</p>
<p>Peter smiled. “Of course.”</p>
<p>She let out a loud sigh. “I can’t wait to go back.”</p>
<p>Their two eyes finally became one, and their tongues started to tangle with each other. Peter pulled on Deborah’s back with one hand, and their bodies got closer. His other hand was grabbing the part of her buttocks that were past the tip of her breastplate. If Peter had touched a civilian with the same amount of force, their pelvis would have been crushed. However, the throbbing pain was tolerable to Deborah.</p>
<p>Deborah grabbed Peter’s neck with a screaming moan. Nevertheless, their tongues didn’t stop. Their grip on their hips and necks tightened even more. When their actions became violent, Deborah loosened her grasp first because someone was approaching Peter. It was Ian Jones, the owner of one of the five seats. He seemed to want to hear more about Odin’s real identity.</p>

<p>Chapter 302</p>
<p>The gates hadn’t opened yet, so no Light Pillars had appeared at the four sides where the troops had advanced to. It stayed quiet without any new quest notifications popping up. Nothing happened until dawn. Everyone had left, and Orca was the only one standing by my side. Orca was also as quiet as a monk as if it was contemplating or rummaging through its memory warehouse.</p>
<p>It broke the silence by using my language. It wasn’t surprising because even the sparrow near a school sings the primer[1]. I had wondered when it would start speaking in Korean, and apparently, it was now.</p>
<p>It stated, “Not coming. Maruka.”</p>
<p>I raised an eyebrow. “Then?”</p>
<p>“Baclan,” Orca responded tersely.</p>
<p>It was predictable. The Maruka Clan had regressed in exchange for sealing me. Therefore, the Baclan Corps were now taking over the task of annihilating us because they were historically the second strongest after the Maruka. At least I no longer had to deal with the problem of having the entire battlefield being turned into a swamp.</p>
<p>However, it continued, “Barba. Graf. Declan. Kciphos.”</p>
<p>He mentioned all the names of the monster corps. This was why the sky had been quiet. A big question came to my mind.</p>
<p>‘Aside from the enormous firepower, is that possible in this small region?’</p>
<p>The Seven Demon Kings were from different civilizations. They didn’t have similarities other than the fact that they all worshiped the same supreme god, Doom Kaos. Therefore, they stayed in their regions when they invaded the Awakened in the past, and there had never been an occasion where more than one corps attacked in the same area.</p>
<p>It was weird. Orca was still talking, “Lunea.”</p>
<p>Lunea?</p>
<p>“What is that?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Lunea worship. Doom Dejire.”</p>
<p>“...!”</p>
<p>This was the summary of what Orca said.</p>
<p>No.1 Doom Kaos</p>
<p>No.2 Doom Arukuda - Baclan Corps</p>
<p>No.3 Doom Entegasto - Barba Corps</p>
<p>No.4 Doom Insectum - Maruka Clan, Graf Clan</p>
<p>No.5 Doom Moun - Kciphos Corps</p>
<p>No.6 Doom Dejire - ?</p>
<p>No.7 Doom Caso - Declan Corps</p>
<p>I had only known that Doom Dejire existed, but there had never been any quests directly related to him. The monster group that followed it had never been at the forefront either, and there had been no dungeon where they lived. In other words, those who obeyed Doom Dejire were as secretive as the presence of the Seven Demon Kings.</p>
<p>I just found out their name, Lunea. The System classified monsters into either clan or corps based on the following logic: clans if the same mother (like a queen) gave birth to them, corps if not. That was the standard by which the System distinguished monsters. I didn’t know if the Lunea were a clan or a corps, but that wasn’t the important thing. What mattered the most was figuring out their characteristics!</p>
<p>! Baclan Corps - Primitive toughness.</p>
<p>! Barba Corps - Governing class: Power that manages death, Subjugated class: Plague.</p>
<p>! Maruka Clan - Explosive reproductivity, learns through repeated resurrections.</p>
<p>! Graf Clan - Poison.</p>
<p>! Kciphos Corps - Explosive reproductivity, organizational power.</p>
<p>! Declan Corps - Indomitable will.</p>
<p>I was able to summarize the other Seven Demon Kings in that way, but like I had mentioned earlier, the Lunea was a secret species. I wanted to ask Orca more about it, but that was all it knew. Yeon-Hee was coming back just in time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“It’s a bit vague to say that it was a lie…” Yeon-Hee explained.</p>
<p>Since she had to move to her area where the gate had opened, she was holding her returning stone tightly. Orca avoided my gaze as soon as Yeon-Hee released it.</p>
<p>She continued, “Amon, the Grand Duke of the Maruka clan, will come to kill this child. Other than that, Orca also doesn’t know anything about the Lunea. Does it bother you a lot? The Lunea?”</p>
<p>Of course it did. I told Yeon-Hee why the Seven Demon Kings couldn’t be in one space. Then, Yeon-Hee came to the same conclusion as me. She said the reason why it became possible was because of the Lunea as they would play a role in suppressing conflicts between different civilizations of the Seven Demon Kings.</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t this species be specialized in mental powers then?” I asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee pursed her lips. “Hmm…”</p>
<p>It was already hard enough for the regular Awakened to deal with the dead infected with the plague and the poisoned corpses that were walking around. If the monsters specialized in mind control came in at once…</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Doom Kaos was clearly very determined to exterminate us. It was the System’s decision that worried me at the moment. During the Final Stage in the past, none of the Awakened in leadership, including our guilds, had access to the final quest as the System had ended the Stage hurriedly. It sent all of us to the Stage of Rest. We had no choice but to be wary of the tranquil space without knowing the truth about the Stage of Advent. A comfortable shelter, plenty of food, and a wide range of easily accessible boxes were placed there.</p>
<p>However, that was when the malicious part of the System still existed. Those who had taken over the boxes were in leadership positions who had mental healers under them. Now I knew why the Stage of Rest was created: mankind’s defeat had been confirmed.</p>
<p>The System couldn’t leave us to die there. It knew that the battlefield would be moved to our home, Earth, so it made us, the defeated soldiers, rest before we fought again. That was it. I was afraid the System would make a snap judgment again.</p>
<p>“Guide.”</p>
<p>I cried out hastily. It didn’t come out once.</p>
<p>“Guide. Guide!”</p>
<p>[Hello. We would have met sooner or later, anyway. Let me introduce myself. My name is Lumah-le. Hehe! (๑╹ڡ╹๑) ]</p>
<p>It wasn’t earnest at all, and it felt like it was ridiculing us. The fate of mankind might not mean anything to these guys. Even while I was suppressing the flaring anger inside me, my heart was pounding so hard and telling me to snap off its tiny throat right away. Like the way I did to the First Evil and the First Virtue.</p>
<p>[I’m the only one who got promoted to the Final Stage. If you have any intention to challenge me, put that thought aside. You should protect me, not kill me. Oops! I wasn’t supposed to say that, but oh well. It’s all good. It was only a matter of time before you found out.]</p>
<p>The meaning of the message hadn’t been fully delivered to Yeon-Hee. She used to look at the Spirit like it was a fairy in a fairy tale, but she was now looking at it the way she stared at Orca. I shook my head at her, then asked the Spirit, “Is it a quest?”</p>
<p>[Yes, if the invasion begins.]</p>
<p>“Why should we protect you?”</p>
<p>[Hmm… Should I tell you or not? I’m debating. This is something you can’t figure out even with the trait Explorer. I’d like to think of this as the first step to building trust in each other. What do you think?]</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>[What do you think are the roles of the Guide? Hehe. The System has given us a lot of power, and great power has been concentrated on me, Lumah-le! Wow! Wow! I, Lumah-le, won the fierce competition between 450,000 Guides.]</p>
<p>It flew around my head as if it was showing off. Then, it stopped exactly between my eyebrows.</p>
<p>[You should treat me well because I will send you back home. And that’s why you have to protect me. Do you understand why we need to build trust in each other?]</p>
<p>I snarled, “I will end this war with my own hands. The System and you should stop being bossy. If you keep that, we can be good friends. I won’t hurt you either.”</p>
<p>Motherfucker.</p>
<p>[I can hear you swearing at me. Also, I respect your confidence that you can hurt me, but you should get rid of that thought. That will get in the way of our relationship.]</p>
<p>I narrowed my eyes. “Just answer me. I will fulfill what the System wants with my own hands.”</p>
<p>[You are going to figure it out soon. I don’t understand why you are rushing me. I’ll just put up the quest right now.]</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>[Pardon me?]</p>
<p>“Do you know anything about the species Lunea?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the Spirit’s face hardened, a look I had never seen before.</p>
<p>[We were once called that way. Just as you are called ‘human beings.’]</p>
<p>“Were you all born from the same creature?” I asked.</p>
<p>[Where did you hear about all of this?]</p>
<p>It meant they had a mother. In other words, they were the Lunea Clan, not a corps. There was no doubt because the System kept them trotting. The Guides had left the clan earlier than the others.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I assumed that there were two ways that Doom Kaos and the other Dooms under him aimed to conquer one dimension. One was a destructive method that encroached on the life and soul of the dimension and the land. Another method was to train the army like the way the Seven Demon Kings trained their troops.</p>
<p>Currently, humans were on the verge of extinction as there were humans who had been changed because of the plague and poisons on the earth that the Seven Demon Kings had spread over the land. Furthermore, Doom Kaos and its subordinates didn’t even give us the opportunity to worship them. This basically meant that they had decided to destroy our dimension.</p>
<p>[٩(๑`^´๑)۶ I asked you. Where did you hear that?]</p>
<p>The Guide turned its head toward Orca as if it had found the answer itself. Its expression was similar to when it was filled with malice as a red light was glowing from its body.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee reacted immediately. She came between Orca and the Spirit to prevent the Spirit from acting spitefully towards it, but everyone could still see Orca’s face as it was too big.</p>
<p>“The Guide said your fellows are coming here to kill us.”</p>
<p>Orca’s head turned toward me only after I spoke to it.</p>
<p>I continued, “Heh. Our Great System is not even as good as Orca. Everything is coming. Barba, Baclan, Declan, Maruka, Graf, Kciphos, and the Lunea Clan.”</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>“However, I have prepared countermeasures. We will kill everything, including the Lunea Clan. Now it is their turn to play the same games we have been playing. Does that matter?”</p>
<p>[No, because I’m no longer a Lunean.]</p>
<p>“Then, make sure you tell the System to make the right quest. If I don’t like it, I might wreck the game board.”</p>
<p>[May I say one thing? I’m more concerned about Doom Dejire than the mother of the Lunea Clan.]</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>[Be careful if you encounter the incarnation of Doom Dejire. It may send you, the Challenger, to the past where you are bound to die. Everyone has a moment like that. Hehe.]</p>

<p>Chapter 303</p>
<p>I definitely saw it.</p>
<p>[If…]</p>
<p>It had disappeared in a flash, but it was clearly a notification message. I came down from the girl’s stomach, then her hand groped around my chest.</p>
<p>She murmured, “What’s going on?”</p>
<p>She was hallucinating.</p>
<p>I responded apathetically, “Shut up.”</p>
<p>However, the girl was still busy stimulating my sexually sensitive area. I kicked her off of me, and only then did she stop touching me. The girl began to search for a bowl full of monster blood instead of me.</p>
<p>This was the problem with cheap whores. Although consuming monster blood caused terribly negative hallucinations, there were many who were addicted to it as it occasionally showed them scenes of the outside world. It was okay up to that point, but the problem was that they turned into monsters during intercourse if they consumed more than the recommended dose. This girl wasn’t too addicted, but…</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>What was that message? I had seen bolded messages before, but this was the first time a message had winked in and out before I could read it properly. It was also the first time I was seeing a sentence that wasn’t properly organized. The System was never like that. I wondered if I had inadvertently swallowed some monster's blood while I was sucking on the girl’s nipple. That was a possibility, and if it was true, I really had some rotten luck.</p>
<p>I snarled, “Stop it. You are going to drink something stronger soon.”</p>
<p>I kicked the girl’s bowl away from her before coming out of the tent. I was the first one out. Those who had been forced to be in my party were still relieving their stress with the girls. The street was filled with screams that sounded worse than the Maruka Clan’s cries, which made goosebumps rise all over me.</p>
<p>At that moment, I smelled fresh blood. Those who had just finished the battle were returning and entering the street. The impatient ones raided the tents and pulled out naked men who were still having fun. These people were one of the main attack squads on the main stage. The fact that they had returned alive meant that we were safe from the Maruka clan, at least for today. Of course, that was only true if the System didn’t decide to give us an unexpected quest or if no hostile enemy camps attacked.</p>
<p>Anyway, it was time to move. Thanks to my Chaser trait, I had been receiving a lot of attention, almost too much, from the leadership, but this didn’t mean I was guaranteed to survive. Avoiding them was the best option I had for now.</p>
<p>I got up to move, but then I heard someone calling me from behind in a sing-song tone, “Where are you going, Money?”</p>
<p>This guy had been acting more like a jerk ever since he figured out I hated that name. Nothing would have benefited him no matter how much he provoked me, but he was an idiot.</p>
<p>Blood rushed toward my temples for a moment, but it was not because of him. It was because I felt like it was pathetic that I’d be stuck in the same group as these assholes until the Final Stage. I was afraid that I would end up dying alongside them.</p>
<p>Since the very start, the Stage of Advent had been dominated by outside rules. The gap between the rich and the poor was only getting bigger. After slipping into Act One, Stage Two, I became a defeated soldier again. The loser who had barely escaped from Wall Street was a loser here too.</p>
<p>I winked to remind him that the main soldiers had returned. Then, he stiffened and began to follow me. However, this idiot was still busy rummaging through the dead bodies left on the street. There was nothing left to find. All he wanted was a piece of jerky, but all that came out was moldy flesh. His hands soon became covered in trash and moldering remains.</p>
<p>He asked while rubbing the flesh of the unknown Awakened from his breastplate, “Let me ask you one thing. It’s definitely not God’s name. Why does everyone call you Money?”</p>
<p>Maybe he was targeting me too. However, I had already made my own calculations and decisions. This guy wasn’t the only one with the trait Chaser. I had that trait as well. Even if the System decided not to give us an Assassination quest next, I knew that this guy would be my next prey during the next mission. Well, it was quite likely that he would die before that. Therefore, there was no need to be impatient or show hostility towards him. I needed his cooperation to get to the next camp alive.</p>
<p>“Are you deaf?” he asked.</p>
<p>He was going to die anyway, so I ignored his sarcasm.</p>
<p>[If you encounter the incarnation of Doom Dejire…]</p>
<p>I didn’t even blink this time, but the notification message popped up for one second and then disappeared.</p>
<p>The incarnation of Doom Dejire?</p>
<p>Even negative hallucinations couldn’t create something that didn’t exist. After all, hallucinations were based on a person’s own memories. My father could appear as a ghoul and try to eat me, but a hypothetical younger brother couldn’t do the same as I was an only child and didn’t have any siblings.</p>
<p>I had never heard of the name ‘The Incarnation of Doom Dejire,’ before. The title was too compelling to forget. It was ‘incarnation!’</p>
<p>I snarled quietly, “I want to dig out your fucking eyes.”</p>
<p>The notification message appeared again even while he was talking.</p>
<p>[Be careful.]</p>
<p>Be careful if you encounter the incarnation of Doom Dejire…?</p>
<p>I got it now. This wasn’t a message from the System. I had a strong hunch that there was another presence sending this communication as it was written quite informally, which differed a lot from the System.</p>
<p>Fucking Guide… But that doesn’t make sense.</p>
<p>The Guide was an evil spirit that could only be seen in Camp One. It was clearly quite busy dealing with the elites, so why would it spend time trying to warn a loser like me? It was difficult to determine who or what this messenger was. I personally wished that it was a sign of a hidden quest.</p>
<p>At that moment, I heard a sharp shriek that was loud enough to slit my throat with its sound waves.</p>
<p>“Money! Jong-Soo! The commander wants to see you both.”</p>
<p>The time finally had come. Even if the girls were cheap, I knew what was coming for us as soon as we were given time with them. I had no choice but to grasp the amulet in my pocket.</p>
<p>Father. Please protect me again this time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was a rumor saying that some had already been upgraded to B-class. It wasn’t a false rumor because it was true from what I put together. Kang Woo-Seong, the commander of the corps, was a strong B-Class Awakened. He was certainly different from what I could barely feel at a distance. His charisma silently pressured the people around him, and that applied to even those who didn’t have the Chaser trait. However, he also currently had the same vibe as those who had been seriously injured.</p>
<p>He soon gave us permission to finish our greeting. When I looked up, I could see small tentacles wriggling everywhere on him. The healers behind him were busy removing them. It meant this battle had been so fierce that even he had gotten seriously wounded.</p>
<p>It was my turn, and I would soon be sent to the swamp of hell. I would be used as a Chaser, not a useless E-class Awakened.</p>
<p>Fuck. Fuck. Fucking hell!</p>
<p>There was no way out for me.</p>
<p>“Have you all said hi to each other?”</p>
<p>The voice was from one of the commander’s people. He was my immediate superior’s boss, and all the crappy tasks I had to undertake had come from this man’s hands. I felt a swift surge of anger, but I had to suppress it here.</p>
<p>“Yes,” four people chorused in unison at the same time, and the message popped again.</p>
<p>[It may send you, the Challenger…]</p>
<p>The message appeared vaguely, then vanished instantly. I carefully looked around just in case the Guide was floating around. However, I couldn’t spot a blue or red luminous body anywhere. ‘Challenger’ was a title I had never heard of before. An ominous feeling overwhelmed me. Whether it was a hallucination or a real message from the Guide, this could have been my place to die. These guys were actually pushing me to death instead of just being wary of me.</p>
<p>The others were busy drooling while having fun with girls, but I had grasped the true intentions of these people. We would be sent to Camp One. The last tracks of the attack squads and parties who had gone missing in other areas were all found there. It was definitely Camp One. Also, the reason why we, Camp Twelve, who lacked the manpower to invade Camp One, were constantly being sent there might be related to the privileges given to the center stage by the blue Guide. However, I didn’t know any of the details.</p>
<p>“Good. Be happy. You guys finally have a chance to repay the Buddha. If you successfully complete the mission, then the Buddha will call you in and incorporate you into the corps that is under his direct control. You will receive equipment and insignia that you couldn’t even dream of. If you want, your safety can even be guaranteed until the end of the Final Stage.”</p>
<p>He was trying to bait us with honeyed words. However, even an idiot wouldn’t believe that they could keep us truly safe.</p>
<p>“What is the mission?” one of the idiots asked.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t care about the commander’s reply as all my attention was drawn to the message that showed up again.</p>
<p>[To the past where you are bound to die.]</p>
<p>It may send you, the Challenger, to the past where you are bound to die…? What the fuck is this?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Traits could be divided into two groups: high ranks and lower ranks. Also, the fact that I could be sent back to the past where I was bound to die proved that the incarnation of Doom Dejire had the ability to handle time. I couldn’t believe that a monster with such a transcendent ability existed in this world. Oh well, technically, anything could be possible. Perhaps ‘Doom Dejire’ was another name for the System.</p>
<p>I unintentionally looked straight at the commander. I thought that someone who had lived in a different area than us, like the commander, would have been able to explain this mysterious phenomenon. I wanted someone to give me an explanation as to what the faint message was and what the name meant.</p>
<p>I had a hunch that it was a warning message. However, it wasn’t possible that I was the only one receiving it. If I assumed that it was not a hallucination, then it was something that should have been also sent to those who monopolized the secrets surrounding the Stage of Advent. For example: the king of our camp, the Japanese Sakyamuni Buddha and his subordinates, and those who ruled the world under the name of God such as Osiris, Odin, Hera, Kali, and Shiva.</p>
<p>Then, I made eye contact with the commander, and I hurriedly looked away. However, I could no longer avoid the scary gaze staring at me. When he stood up, I was frightened out of my wits. He was looking down at me, and I could see his exposed abdomen. The tentacles that also bloomed in his gut were spreading his wound open like a doctor’s scalpel.</p>
<p>He opened his mouth. Fortunately, he wasn’t pissed that I had looked directly at him without permission.</p>
<p>“The mission is… simple. Find out where the Guide is. The location should be accurate.”</p>
<p>I lowered my head, but my party members inadvertently raised their heads. However, it was natural for them to do so. Walking on the swamp of hell laid out by the Maruka clan, reaching Camp One by avoiding the butchers of other camps, and even entering the territory of Camp One all meant that this was a death sentence.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the leaders of our camp must have given this impossible mission because there was probably a privilege they could obtain from Camp One by doing this. Disobedience meant death. Therefore, the best-case scenario for us was to arrive at the next camp where Odin controlled things and die there.</p>
<p>Any camp was bound to kill a traitor, but there were things I had prepared for this day. I had to share my camp’s secrets little by little as time went by so that they couldn’t kill me until the end of the Final Stage.</p>
<p>That was why I had been snooping around the house of prostitution after selling everything I had other than the minimum number of items and insignia I needed. In addition, I had been collecting poisonous fluids from Adult Grafs. My immediate superior, his boss, and even the commander weren’t aware of how much I actually knew.</p>
<p>Fucking morons.</p>
<p>There were many things I couldn’t hide no matter how much I tried during the fierce battles. There were also witnesses, and they revealed secrets as they had sex with the girls or drank the monsters’ blood with them. Even if it was a bluff and worthless story for someone, they became an important piece to complete a puzzle when they were combined together. The problem was how to get through the hell swamp with these idiots slowing me down…</p>
<p>Everyone was quiet because we knew what would happen if we told them that the mission was basically a suicide mission or if we requested them to add more personnel. Even if it was clear that we would die, we had to carry it out as soon as we received the order,</p>
<p>[Everyone…]</p>
<p>The moment when the faint message appeared, we all came out of the command barrack. We were silent because we knew our looming fates.</p>
<p>One of the idiots ordered as his eyes flashed with murderous intention, “Gather up.”</p>
<p>He was speaking very quietly. He clearly wanted to run away after taking all the stuff from the injured who had returned from the battle because we had no choice but to die in the end. In fact, I was actually going to suggest doing that too. However, it was impossible to blindly break into the barracks of the injured as the healers were there. We would be going to our deaths even faster if we did that. After all, the healers treating the main attack squad had superior capabilities compared to us.</p>
<p>Instead, I took out a bottle containing poisonous fluid from Adult Grafs. Then, everyone started to smile silently as they winked at the streets where the house of prostitution was located. They even laughed quietly under their breath. No other explanation was necessary as everyone had grasped the idea.</p>
<p>The poisonous fluid wasn’t intended for the wounded or the healers. It was for the prostitutes. The girls were complacent, but from the leadership’s point of view, they were high-quality resources like the main attack force. Therefore, they wouldn’t just sit and watch them die.</p>
<p>Our opportunity would come when the main force’s healers were temporarily absent from the barracks. And then the real plan would start after we ran away from the residence. The terrifying sight beyond the wooden fence continued to grab my attention. There were an endless number of heads and limbs sticking out of the mud like weeds in the vast swamp of the Maruka Clan. I wondered if it would be possible to survive there with these members. I felt like we would end up becoming a few of those weeds soon.</p>
<p>[Has a moment like that. Hehe.]</p>
<p>Brrr-</p>
<p>I trembled suddenly, and many thoughts came rushing into my mind along with all kinds of messages popping up.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Be careful if you encounter the incarnation of Doom Dejire. It may send you, the Challenger, to the past where you are bound to die. Everyone has a moment like that. Hehe.]</p>
<p>That message was now arranged in a proper way, and it stayed up even when I opened and closed my eyes repeatedly. Then, more messages poured in at once.</p>

<p>There were bound to be a lot of messages because I had met the Guide Lumah-le, fought against the Declan Corps after the Seven Demon Kings tore the sky apart, and faced the incarnation of Doom Dejire. It had been hiding in the Declan Corps and had appeared in front of me out of the blue. The messages that were supposed to pop up at those moments were now pouring in at once.</p>
<p>However, the message saying that Doom Dejire would send me to the past where I would die was not talking about the time. It was similar because it had thrown me into one of the life-or-death crises I had experienced before. Yes, everything earlier was a part of a memory that had happened a long time ago. I was now in the mental world.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 304</p>
<p>I realized that I was inside the mental world right before Doom Dejire attacked me. The messages that had flooded in suddenly now stopped, and I noticed what I could do at the same time. Thanks to Yeon-Hee, I had quite an understanding of the rules in this world. If Doom Dejire had taken complete control of my mental world, then what I could see wouldn’t be a mere fragment of my memory in the past. Instead, it could be a gallows strangling me like the way Yeon-Hee hanged Priya.</p>
<p>However, it couldn’t do that. It was definitely hiding somewhere here, which meant it also had constraints. It was either disgusting itself as a corps commander or one of the many morons here. Or it might have been waiting to attack me in the swamp as a powerful purebred member of the Maruka Clan.</p>
<p>I was trying to hide that I was conscious of this fact. Therefore, I was going to release the poison in the house of prostitution just like I had planned earlier instead of making a fuss. I planned to find Doom Dejire by acting the same way as I did in the past.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, this world was slowly cracking apart. Doom Dejire must have concluded that it couldn’t kill me in this memory fragment. It would have been possible if I was still the E-class Money, but there was no way it could defeat Odin at Level 559. After all, I was someone who had concentrated all the unbelievably powerful resources into myself! Although I was in a created mental world, I was able to transform back into Odin at Level 559 as soon as I had grasped reality.</p>
<p>Whoosh!</p>
<p>A quick look at tinyurl.com/2p9emv8w will leave you more fulfilled.</p>
<p>Doom Dejire was flipping through my memory album quickly, and all of my memories flashed and disappeared within one second. There were scenes that I never wanted to see again. It was uncomfortable to see what I had done to survive and get stronger in the past. After my memories of the Final Stage in this era vanished, the scene of the entire world breaking down unfolded. Only one part of the memory appeared like a picture and then it quickly moved on to the next one. I became more certain about it.</p>
<p>However, Doom Dejire kept flipping the pages. The Revolucion uprising and the moment when I was almost killed by the First Virtue flashed by men. Following that, I was watching the scene that would flash at the moment of my death. Then, it was the last one, and it was clearly the end of the world in the past.</p>
<p>When I blinked, an old, frowning face appeared. It said while waving the pocket, “This is not enough. It is more expensive now.”</p>
<p>Whizzzz.</p>
<p>The sound of an electrical generator running filled the narrow cave. The electrical wires that were spread throughout the cave looked like they would break at any moment. I remembered that this was one of the hideouts used in the past.</p>
<p>While I stayed silent for a few seconds, he threw pictures on the table. My old mother was pictured in them, and she was relying on oxygen respirators in a dirty environment where things looked extremely unhygienic. There were several pieces of food that looked inedible and water in crushed water bottles next to the bed. He looked into the photo with me, then said with confidence. “Her condition is great, so show more sincerity and love toward your mom.”</p>
<p>He took his eyes off the picture and started to look around the cave. He was checking if there was anything else to rip from me, and soon he fixed on where the electricity generator was.</p>
<p>Up to that point, things were the same as they had occurred in my old memories. This guy was a survival broker who extorted items and mana stones like crazy, but he did his job. I was checking on my mother’s safety through this guy. Even then, I couldn’t take my eyes off the picture. I could guess why Doom Dejire had brought me back to this time out of all the other moments in my memories.</p>
<p>I tore up the picture in front of him because everything here was an illusion. It would have thought that this could confuse me.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that you can’t believe this proof until you check on her in person? Now? Feel free to check her out.”</p>
<p>At the time, my mother was in an area that was under the First Evil’s great influence. Since it was one of the few surviving regions in the world, the First Evil had appeared there many times. In fact, I had actually infiltrated the territory to get more information about the First Evil. That was when I had also checked on my mother’s safety.</p>
<p>Anyway, he intentionally raised his voice to call his party in from outside of the cave. They didn’t have a necromancer with them, but some could handle the power of death and some could spread a plague while walking crookedly due to their hump.</p>
<p>This world was interesting. There was no difference in their reactions, and it was as if I had actually returned to the past. They were certainly wary of me when they came in the same way they did in the past. They thought I might have hidden traps somewhere, and I knew their weaknesses. I stared at each one of them carefully. Of course, Doom Dejire wasn’t there. If it was hiding in the shape of these guys, I would have fatally wounded it as soon as I saw it.</p>
<p>Following that, things began to progress differently from what had actually happened, but they were still being done in a similar manner. In the past, I had told him to take the electrical generator, but here he stepped out and said that he would take it first. The scene of him not only tearing off the generator, but also collecting all the equipment and electrical wires attached to it made me laugh. I wanted to see if Doom Dejire was here.</p>
<p>What would kill me here?</p>
<p>All it could do was create a conflict between me and the imaginary Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. However, even if they had all reached the maximum level and gathered up, they couldn’t kill me. They had barely managed to handle Doom Caso’s incarnation together, so there was no way they would be able to kill me. In fact, there was nothing much Doom Dejire could do as I was now aware of the situation. All it could do was tie me up in these fragments of memory, but that wouldn’t affect the battlefield outside. Therefore, it was reasonable to stop thinking about what to do with me here and continue the real fight outside.</p>
<p>I came out of the cave.</p>
<p>[* Inventory]</p>
<p>[Skeletal Dragon that even the Living Worship has been taken out.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Nothing stopped me. The flying monsters that tried jumping into my plane were burnt to ashes, and so did any psychopaths that appeared while I was flying all the way to New York. New York and Washington were the only two remaining survival zones across the North American continent. The undead were swarming in the rest of the land, and the barrier that confronted them smelled like a sewage purifier.</p>
<p>I could feel the signs of the First Evil when I reached the Eight Evils’ home. The first one who had soared into the sky was the Third Evil, and he was riding the same mount as me. The dark energy running inside the empty skeleton of the Third Evil’s skeletal dragon felt real.</p>
<p>“...Money?”</p>
<p>The Third Evil recognized me, and it was his turn to look confused. However, his face was mangled as if it was being played through an old tv with static. Since I had no memory of his confused expression, it was being reflected in the mental world. This was also a phenomenon that had happened as Doom Dejire had failed to take complete control of my mental world. Anyway, I couldn’t feel any hints of Doom Dejire from the Third Evil. Therefore, I ignored the illusion and jumped down toward his home base.</p>
<p>I had never penetrated into the house of the Eight Evils in the past. Although I had infiltrated into one of their individual headquarters, the place where all of them were gathered was a prohibited area. Therefore, the scenes I saw while going down to the first floor from the rooftop were a combination of many memories. The building was built on the basis of the headquarters I had been to before, but my power broke even that. Right before I reached the first floor I activated a skill.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Thunderstorm.]</p>
<p>A thunderstorm came out of me and burned, blew away, and destroyed my surroundings into ash and powder! The feeling of crushing the Eight Evils’ home was awesome. I knew everything was a fantasy and fake, but I was thrilled at the scene that could have never happened before.</p>
<p>They finally appeared while the dust and small embers were flying around. The First, Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Eighth Evil. As the world was created based on my memories, they had all appeared. However, many of their faces were mangled like the Third Evil as I had actually never seen them. However, the First Evil was different. The way he looked at me with interest was the same as he did in the past. Then, I could find another being looking at me carefully in his eyes.</p>
<p>I said while scanning the destroyed buildings, “This is what I have been waiting for so long. Thank you. I’m serious.”</p>
<p>I smiled and continued, “Changing the place again won’t change this framework. You must think you have locked me up, but heh heh. You are simply locking yourself up. If you have any talent left, show me.”</p>
<p>The lightning bolts that would pierce not only him but also the other Evils like skewers flashed in unison inside the thunderstorm that was raging around.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Doom Dejire ran away.</p>
<p>[Warning: Adonis’ Sacred Helmet has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>The shattered fragments of my helmet were falling down past my eyes. The next scene was the sight I had seen just before I had fallen into the mental world. The torn and burned bodies of the Declans were lying all over the place. However, Doom Dejire’s incarnation was gone. This was why I had unfolded Odin’s Battlefield, so it was easy for me to find its incarnation.</p>
<p>“Are you going to run away again?” I asked tauntingly.</p>
<p>It was making a crack at the end of the warzone. It wasn’t as huge as Doom Caso’s incarnation. On the contrary, it was tiny like the spirits, so it looked like I could grasp with one hand. It definitely had modeled itself after the Lunea Clan similar to the way Doom Caso’s incarnation had appeared in the form of a Declan monster.</p>
<p>I threw myself at it and shouted, “Are you going to die like that? Stop hiding in a shell and reveal yourself!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 305</p>
<p>Seong-Il was still concerned when he returned from the most recent battle. Mary had joined them in the Final Stage. At first glance, she seemed to have become much more positive, but he soon realized that she was just hiding her cruel self behind a smile. Thus, he knew that she would never keep Lee Soo-Ah alive if she encountered the other woman, who would appear as the general commander of the Baclan Corps.</p>
<p>However, there was no way for him to intervene. He was assigned under Osiris. Also, there were swarms of monsters between each corps. Even if it was possible, he had given a secret order to secure [The Book of Death 1] that Necromancer Shaimar, the general commander of the Barba Corps, held. Therefore, he couldn’t leave Osiris’s side.</p>
<p>Odin might have given Osiris the same order, but he didn’t seem to fully trust him. That was why he had purposefully assigned Seong-Il to Osiris’s corps instead of Tae-Han’s or Mary’s group and ordered him to watch Osiris closely.</p>
<p>Seong-Il had met all kinds of people on the way to the Final Stage. However, Osiris had the most unpleasant vibe out of all of them. His real name was Joshua von Karjan. He was one of the five owners of the seats in the semicircle and was a foreigner who had been working under Odin since a long time ago, before the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Rumor had it that he was the founder of the old Revolucion and was a famous figure in the outside world. He had also made a speech during the press conference that predicted the Stage of Advent. But Seong-Il didn’t remember much about it.</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his nose out of habit, then looked at Osiris. Osiris was alone again after returning from battle. To be exact, the hooded man never gave anyone explicit permission to approach him. He was sitting by himself, looking at the ground, but it somehow gave off the impression that he was screaming in agony. There seemed to be a greater danger looming around him now than when he was actively battling.</p>
<p>Moreover, even Osiris’s immediate subordinates looked dangerous. Whenever he saw them exchanging looks and whispering to each other, it reminded him of a bunch of evil spirits having a meeting together. In fact, the other Awakened were frightened of Osiris and his people.</p>
<p>Will I even be able to stop him?</p>
<p>If Osiris violated Odin’s orders and took [The Book of Death 1] for himself... Seong-Il wasn’t confident that he would be able to stop him. He would definitely try, but Osiris was the third strongest in the rankings after Mary. A large number of strong Awakened had joined during the Final Stage, but Osiris was on a whole other level. Well, of course, excluding Odin and Mary.</p>
<p>Then, one of the camp executives approached Seong-Il.</p>
<p>“Mr. Caliber.”</p>
<p>This executive was under Osiris, and he was accompanied by a Korean interpreter. The two of them also seemed to be conscious about Osiris as the latter was watching them. Seong-Il immediately grasped the reason why they had come and stood up. They relocated to the spot where Osiris couldn’t see them.</p>
<p>“Are you done figuring it out?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>“He said yes,” the interpreter translated.</p>
<p>“What about the first floor’s boundary?”</p>
<p>The interpreter shook his head. “He said nothing has happened so far.”</p>
<p>“Then, go ahead.”</p>
<p>The interpreter suddenly said, “He is asking if you remember Act Two, Stage One.”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course.”</p>
<p>“He said it’s easy to understand if you think of it as having our situations being switched around.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking about stuff I already know,” Seong-Il replied while looking back. The lightning that Odin had created was connecting the sky and the earth, and the light was very bright. It was so bright that it was difficult to check his notification window.</p>
<p>[Until the first weakening: 6 days 14 hours 32 minutes 51 seconds]</p>
<p>“What I’m curious about is what I should destroy to weaken the monsters right away. There is one more thing to consider besides waiting until the time limit ends. We should weaken them as much as possible, then sweep them away. Don’t you think so?”</p>
<p>The interpreter said, “There are small altars set up, and he thinks they are the ones.”</p>
<p>“He thinks? Why is he not sure about it?” Seong-Il prodded.</p>
<p>“He said he is sure it’s the altar. He needs the leadership’s decision about it.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il grimaced. “There are so many rats out there. By the way, how are you going to deal with the plague? We will be screwed if we try attacking the altars under only an assumption, leading to increased casualties. You guys have been through the previous Stage. Do you now know what happens if they go nuts?”</p>
<p>The executive hesitated and didn’t answer. Seong-Il frowned as he had noticed that the executive was purposefully avoiding the question.</p>
<p>“Hey, hasn’t he been under Osiris from the beginning? That’s what I heard,” Seong-Il asked the interpreter.</p>
<p>The interpreter nodded. “Yes, that’s what I know, too. He said Osiris will listen if you talk to him…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il growled, “Ah, so I’m a pushover, but Osiris is scary, right? What an asshole. He definitely doesn’t know why I’m called the Caliber. Should I teach you now, you motherfucker? I’m not just a caliber. I’m the Human Caliber. Stop pushing your responsibility onto others.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il also felt uncomfortable at the thought of having a conversation with Osiris.</p>
<p>This world had been united into one stage, but four camps were carrying out independent missions since the Light Pillars were being used by the Seven Demon Kings on each side.</p>
<p>Osiris was the absolute ruler here. If he acted unexpectedly, then there was no way to stop him.</p>
<p>There is no reason why he would do that, but what if he suddenly decides to attack me?</p>
<p>“He is claiming that I misinterpreted his words to you, but I did it correctly.”</p>
<p>The interpreter was also at a loss now.</p>
<p>“You know me, right? There are so many out there who got killed after considering me easy. Are you going to understand me when I crush your head?” Seong-Il stared at the executive, then turned toward the interpreter.</p>
<p>“Tell him that I’ll let it slide because this was his first time annoying me. Also, make sure you tell him how scary I am.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.” The interpreter bent his waist immediately.</p>
<p>Seong-Il continued, “I understand that being the person in the middle of a conflict is hard. But there will be an uproar if you mistranslate things, okay? Be more responsible for what you do.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. Caliber.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il tapped the interpreter’s shoulder and got up.</p>
<p>Whoosh.</p>
<p>He raised his fist as if he would hit the executive. Well, that was what it looked like from the executive’s perspective. However, the fist rushed toward the executive’s nose but didn’t hit. It wasn’t until a strong wind pressure buffeted the executive’s face that he realized what had happened.</p>
<p>Seong-Il turned around and he said to the interpreter, who was standing blankly, “What are you doing? Let’s go see Osiris.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The interpreter was an intelligent guy who could speak both German and English fluently. However, he fumbled like a moron in front of Osiris. A brief reply came out of Osiris’s dark hood, and Seong-Il turned to the interpreter.</p>
<p>“He said… it’s worth a try…” the man stuttered.</p>
<p>Seong-Il snarled, “I don’t think that’s what he said. Ugh, I should learn German. This drives me crazy. Tell him that I will join too.”</p>
<p>The interpreter timidly added, “He is asking how much your Plague Resistance is.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il impatiently responded, “Tell him that my figure is pretty high and that I don’t need a healer. He doesn’t need to worry about it. Hey. Hey! Don’t pass on what I said directly. Sugarcoat the words a bit, okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, for sure. Don’t worry.”</p>
<p>After the interpreter finished, Seong-Il could tell that Osiris was smiling even though he wasn’t making any noise. His eyes were so frightening. It was as if he could see into Seong-Il’s soul and saw something funny. Also, the sour and disgusting smell that came off of Osiris was unpleasant. This was why Seong-Il was reluctant to get close to Osiris.</p>
<p>While Osiris was calling his immediate subordinates over by using his long fingernails that came out from the broad sleeves, Seong-Il thought it was fortunate that Osiris was under Odin’s control. After the Final Stage ended, even these people would go outside, where his only son Ki-Cheol was. Those who were more brutal and cruel than monsters would pour out there.</p>
<p>Everything will be messed up if Odin is not there. It might even be worse than here.</p>
<p>Seong-Il became still with those thoughts running through his head.</p>
<p>Soon, the whispers that were coming from Osiris and his people stopped. What Osiris said while looking at Seong-Il was delivered through the interpreter, “He said you can participate in this.”</p>
<p>After that, a detached force was organized. The center was those who were bracing up for the battle lines on the seventh floor of the boundary where the Light Pillar was standing, and Osiris and his attack team took the lead.</p>
<p>On the way down to the second-floor boundary, Seong-Il witnessed people setting up magic traps. Others were securing food and water.</p>
<p>Then, Seong-Il reached the first floor. The report ‘all serene’ only meant that they were protecting the boundary there, not that there had been no sacrifices. Corpses were strewn around everywhere, and the stuff dripping from the walls were blood and guts. A considerable number of the enemy had been killed by Seong-Il during the first battle, but the battles that had taken place during his absence resulted in more deaths.</p>
<p>Fortunately, neither the high-ranking plague sorcerers nor the necromancers were able to use their real power under the protection inside the boundary of the Light Pillar. If the power that controlled death which turned the victims into ghouls was used within the area, the war situation would proceed out of control and many would die.</p>
<p>Seong-Il gazed at the man approaching Osiris. He was William Spencer, but he was more widely known by his nickname, ‘Chiron.’</p>
<p>I heard he is a long-distance dealer and healer at the same time, right? He must be handy.</p>
<p>William Spencer had joined as the leader of Revolucion (3) during the preparation period of the Final Stage. He was also one of the owners of the five seats in the semicircle.</p>
<p>Seong-Il didn’t regard all of them in a good light. Chiron looked kind even when he scolded his subordinates. Seong-Il thought he should have given off more of an air of danger like Osiris. If such a guy decided to betray them, then he would faint due to stress.</p>
<p>I should be careful. It's not because I'm afraid of them. It's because I don't want their dirt rubbing off on me.</p>
<p>If Seong-Il had been assigned to either Mary’s or Tae-Han’s camp, then there would be no reason for him to be this uneasy. He couldn’t help but feel that he was all alone in the enemy camp.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The place filled with the bodies of Awakened and monsters was bound to be the end of the boundary. To get outside of the boundary, he had to remove the bodies that had piled up. Those who had already died were basically useless trash. Hence, Awakened with high Strength like Seong-Il simply kicked the obstacles out of their way.</p>
<p>When the whole detached force broke through the boundary…</p>
<p>What’s going to happen in an A-class gate if a B-class gate is this difficult? What about an S-class gate?</p>
<p>The endless army of the Barba Corps unfolded in front of him. The whole land was colored in black, and the degree of contamination was so high that it was something that could only be seen in a C-class dungeon.</p>
<p>We should add more healers… Mmm… Never mind. How can we go through that? If the necromancers join them…</p>
<p>When Seong-Il confirmed the Barba corps’ manpower, he changed his mind. He wasn’t Odin. In fact, even the dangerous Osiris couldn’t be compared to Odin. If his team endured the time limit, then the monsters would gradually weaken anyway. That was the key to the victory that Odin had prepared.</p>
<p>Seong-Il asked while looking at the point where he heard Osiris’s voice, “What did he say?”</p>
<p>The interpreter replied hesitantly, “He said that their attacks will get worse if we take too long So, his conclusion is to fight them back until the first weakening by risking the damage…”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah? Then, there’s nothing I can do. Let’s get ready.”</p>
<p>“Mr… Mr. Caliber?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>The interpreter stuttered, “No… No, we shouldn’t. Everyone… Everyone is going to die. Are you going to… just watch that? You are the only one who can stop him. If we hold out until the time limit instead of fighting them… Even if we fail to do so, Odin will…”</p>
<p>The tendons on his temple swelled as if they were about to burst.</p>
<p>Gasp.</p>
<p>Seong-Il caught the moment, but it was too late to respond. More than that, he had no intention of saving the interpreter who had crossed the line. The black summoned objects popped out of Osiris’s shadow before rushing at the interpreter. Both his arms were cut off, and his remaining head was sliced off after Osiris gestured, falling to the floor. Seong-Il didn’t feel anything even when he saw the interpreter’s wide-open eyes.</p>
<p>Stupid.</p>
<p>“Is. There. A. Problem?”</p>
<p>He heard a strange voice and quickly realized that Osiris was speaking to him. However, what surprised him was that Osiris was actually speaking Korean.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head. “No. Did you know how to speak Korean all along? Ah, I shouldn’t have brought the interpreter then. If you had told me earlier, I wouldn’t have made such a fuss.</p>
<p>Seong-Il felt Osiris’s murderous intention focusing on him.</p>
<p>He quickly added, “I’m really sorry that I didn’t manage this moron properly.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il then looked at Osiris’s shadow as ghosts could come out from there again and fly toward him. However, the other man’s shadow returned to its original place. Seong-Il scratched his nose awkwardly and kicked the interpreter’s body to one side. A lot of blood sprayed out. Although it wasn’t monster blood, the smell of fresh blood came into his nostrils as he raised Sense. It was a nice smell to provoke his fighting spirit.</p>
<p>All members of the detached force had finished preparing for the attack. The echo started from the ground, then a roar vibrated the whole world. It was on another level of creepiness compared to the cry of a monster. Seong-Il knew this feeling. It was similar to when he encountered Doom Arukada’s gaze on the mainland of the Baclan Corps.</p>
<p>[Warning: Doom Dejire has entered.]</p>
<p>The messages continued to appear.</p>
<p>[Warning: Doom Dejire has entered.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Doom Dejire has entered.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Doom Dejire has entered.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>The messages repeatedly flashed and disappeared, and everyone turned towards the direction where they heard the sound. It was where the Savior Odin was dealing with the Declan Corps alone without the power of the Light Pillar boundary. One of the Seven Demon Kings had appeared there.</p>
<p>Seong-Il didn’t understand where Odin had gotten such courage. While Odin was fighting the Declan Corps and Doom Deijre by himself, he was over here feeling embarrassed about being scared of rats and reptiles. Seong-Il got revved up and shouted toward Osiris’s back.</p>
<p>“WHOAAAAA! Osiris! Let’s do our job, too! Odin is right there, so we… We should do our job!”</p>
<p>However, Osiris responded quietly. His sleeves moved as slowly while he called his immediate subordinates. An index finger appeared, pointing at the front where the army of the rat Barba Corps was swarming on the plague-spread ground.</p>
<p>Seong-Il ran out immediately.</p>
<p>He screamed wildly, “I’m not going to die more than once! Get out of the way! Here comes the Caliber! Argh!”</p>
<p>The detached force followed him from behind, and they shouted the same thing despite the fact that they were all different races and genders.</p>
<p>“Caliber! Caliber!”</p>
<p>“Caliber! Caliber!”</p>
<p>The screams were at a fast tempo, and Seong-Il also heard the sound of drums signaling the beginning of the battle. Even then, people could hear the horrific cry of Doom Dejire. Seong-Il picked up the pace, hoping it was truly Doom Dejire screaming. Seven Demon Kings? There were rumors that they were gods, but that didn’t matter to him. He decided to leave the real identity of Doom Dejire to those who spread rumors. He didn’t want to learn anything complicated. Odin had simply become stronger.</p>
<p>Odin has torn so many things apart, so the Seven Demon Kinds should also die in the same manner!</p>
<p>Seong-Il pondered while looking at the Barba Corps, which was rapidly narrowing the distance between them.</p>
<p>Wait a little longer, Ki-Cheol. Dad is almost there!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 306</p>
<p>[Barba Plague 2 has been eliminated.]</p>
<p>(Plague Resistance)]</p>
<p>[Barba Plague level: 55]</p>
<p>Seong-Il flailed his arms as soon as he came to his senses. It had become an act of instinct to check if something was after him, but his hands caught nothing. Instead, his whole body was just very itchy. Seong-Il’s hands swung in the air, but they soon came back to his body. He knew he wasn’t supposed to scratch, but he couldn’t stand it. Every time he scratched with his sharp nails, pieces of his flesh came out. He dug harder, but nothing relieved the symptoms. It was getting worse.</p>
<p>“Mr… Mr… Caliber…”</p>
<p>He heard the voice from a distance, and the voice was so soft that he could barely understand it.</p>
<p>He asked, “Are you Ja-Seong?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il tried to get up, but he soon realized that he was a total wreck. His hands were pushing on the ground, but he couldn’t even stand up. The itchiness was driving him crazy, so he didn’t even feel any pain.</p>
<p>Seong-Il checked his surroundings. Since Ja-Seong couldn’t talk through telepathy, Seong-Il lowered his voice as much as he could, “What… happened?”</p>
<p>He was in a small cave where he couldn’t fully stand and stretch out his limbs. The air was stale and sour as if he had been trapped there for hundreds of years.</p>
<p>“Do you… not remember?” Ja-Seong asked in return.</p>
<p>Memories flooded in randomly instead of in chronological order. His ears were ringing, and it felt like he could see the members of the detached force dying like a hallucination. He also saw how he had suffered by himself as he had been isolated during the battle. It was difficult for him to figure out what had happened first and last.</p>
<p>In any case, he now knew why he was still alive even though his defense and plague resistance had been exhausted. Seong-Il stared at the notification window while scratching his body again without even realizing it. He was actually tearing his skin off.</p>
<p>[The God of Wind’s Blessing has been applied to you.]</p>
<p>[Duration (The God of Wind’s Blessing): 2 hours 12 minutes 29 seconds]</p>
<p>Seong-Il did a double take as he realized a possible situation that Ja-Seong could be in and that fact made him forget about the itchiness for a moment. He crawled on the floor. As he had expected, Ja-Seong had been swallowed up by the plague. Seong-Il thought of him as his son in this world, and he was the only one who had reached this point together with him all the way from Act One, Stage One. Therefore, he had a special place in his heart for Ja-Seong. A person’s life and death were decided by fate, but the sight of the boy dying was a shock to him. Seong-Il buried his head in Ja-Seong’s chest as he collapsed.</p>
<p>“You silly kid. You have to live first. You… You should have…” he breathed out.</p>
<p>The God of Wind’s Blessing was one of Ja-Seong's main abilities. Its cooldown time was 14 days, which was very long, but it had been proven to be effective several times. However, Ja-Seong had used it on Seong-Il, not himself.</p>
<p>The teen gasped, “Seong… Seong-Il…”</p>
<p>“Why are you only calling me by my name now? I told you to do so a long time ago. Why now…?” Seong-Il asked bitterly.</p>
<p>Ja-Seong responded, “How much… Are you going to pay me? The… the price for… my… my life…”</p>
<p>“You are so stupid. What is the point of paying you if you die?”</p>
<p>Tears trickled down on Seong-Il’s face, and blood dripped from his wounds.</p>
<p>Ja-Seong continued, “Seong-Il… I trust you.”</p>
<p>“We are almost there. It’s so upsetting to die now. You have gone through so many things to reach this point. What’s wrong with you?”</p>
<p>The teen ignored him and continued, “Zero, five, one, zero…”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Zero, five, one, zero, two, three… three, four, eight, two, four, one, one… Kang Ja… Ja-Seong… My father is Il… Kang… Il-Koo… Mother is… Cho Soo-Yeon…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il couldn’t tell where they were right now, but since the ground was contaminated with plague, they were very likely to be in a corner of the battlefield. Therefore, Seong-Il had no choice but to hold in tears and whisper.</p>
<p>“Seong-Il… You know? I’m… valuable… Zero, five, one, zero, two, three… three, four, eight, two, four, one, one…”</p>
<p>Ja-Seong was struggling to list the number even while he was dying. Seong-Il didn’t want to accept what was going on, but he was neither a healer nor did he have any remaining insignias. All he could do was to clearly repeat what Ja-Seong said. One syllable at a time, so Ja-Seong could close his eyes in peace.</p>
<p>“051023―3482411. Your father is Kang Il-Koo, and your mother is Cho Soo-Yeon.”</p>
<p>Ja-Seong gasped, “Ten billion…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il snapped, “You think you are only worth that much? That’s nonsense.”</p>
<p>“I’m scared… Help me, Seong-Il… I don’t want to die…” the teen pleaded.</p>
<p>Seong-Il interrupted, “Do you think I’ll let you die in front of me? Who am I? I’m the Caliber, Kwon Seong-Il.”</p>
<p>Ja-Seong also knew that it was a pipe dream though.</p>
<p>[Duration (The God of Wind’s Blessing): 1 hour 30 minutes 1 second]</p>
<p>Seong-Il could only move after his body recovered and his plague level had decreased to a certain level. The way Ja-Seong looked in his last moments was horrific. Most of his skin and muscles had melted, revealing his bones. His crumpled head had shrunk to the size of a fist, and dark red mucus was flowing down from every hole in his face such as nostrils and eyes. His fingernails and teeth had already fallen off. Since his body had shrunk, the gap between his body and the armor had widened.</p>
<p>When Seong-Il laid Ja-Seong down on the ground while swallowing his tears, a ring on the youth’s remaining finger came off.</p>
<p>[The God of Wind’s Protective Ring (Item)</p>

<p>Effect: The target will significantly recover from any injury and negative effects. Resistance to certain negative effects increases significantly. The target’s regeneration speed increases significantly in proportion to their Health.</p>
<p>Duration: 4 hours]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ja-Seong’s body continued to dwindle even though he was dead, but Seong-Il had seen countless Awakened who died of the plague reappear as a ghoul. He had no choice but to trample Ja-Seong’s head because it would be troublesome to encounter a ghoul that had reached the master section. Seong-Il felt more miserable than he had ever felt before.</p>
<p>[Barba Plague level: 38]</p>
<p>When Seong-Il came out of the cave, his plague level had fallen below forty. Although his body was still itchy, he could endure it somehow by clenching his teeth and fists until his hands bled.</p>
<p>His first plan was to return to the Osiris Corps, but it wasn’t long before he realized that there was no way for him to break through the raging military force alone. Also, he noticed he wouldn’t be able to get through to them before the duration of the God of Wind’s Blessing ended. Therefore, Seong-Il shifted his attention to the north where Odin’s central stage was located.</p>
<p>[Guild: Odin, the guild leader, completed the quest ‘The Immortal Warriors.’]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Guild: Odin, the guild leader, destroyed the Chouborow (Declan Corps).]</p>
<p>Judging from those notification messages, the Declan Corps must have been somewhat sorted out by Odin! However, another message soon caught his attention.</p>
<p>[Warning: Doom Dejire has entered.]</p>
<p>It was also where Odin was dealing with one of the Seven Demon Kings. Seong-Il painfully sorted through his thoughts. At a time when the number of rats flocking toward him was increasing, he didn’t really have a choice. It would violate Odin’s order, but there was nothing he could do. That was the only way to survive.</p>
<p>I never know. I might be helpful to Odin.</p>
<p>Of course, it would be difficult to get out of the land that was being controlled by the Barba Corps. It was true that they were concentrated around the boundary on the first floor of the Light Pillar, but it was hard to avoid the monsters that would rush toward him from all directions after smelling his flesh. A moment’s judgment determined his life and death, and Seong-Il got an ominous feeling. It was natural for someone to have poor judgment when they were barely holding onto their lives. If he continued to face the crossroads, it was likely he’d take the wrong path and end up disgracing Ja-Seong’s sacrifice.</p>
<p>At any rate, he needed to avoid encountering Shaimar, the general commander, and the other necromancers. Unfortunately, he became more injured in the process of cutting off pursuers. His plague level had previously fallen to the twenties, but had now already risen to the fifties, It was a number that could exceed his current Plague Resistance level. The God of Wind’s Blessing had worn off already.</p>
<p>[Barba Plague: 51]</p>
<p>All he could do if he met a necromancer in this situation was destroy his own brain so that he didn’t become a ghoul! Many Awakened often became ghouls because they didn’t have the resolve to do this, but Seong-Il was ready at any moment to smash his fist between his eyes. He really didn’t want to do it, though…</p>
<p>“Fuck. Fuck. Fuck…”</p>
<p>Escaping from the infected land was not the end as his pursuers continued to chase him. It was only a matter of time before they caught him. What was clear was that he had made the wrong decision. When the sun was about to sink below the horizon, Seong-Il was scratching his entire body and walking at a noticeably slow speed.</p>
<p>[Barba Plague: 61]</p>
<p>He stopped his fingers right in front of his eyes. He would have dug out his eyes if he hadn’t been trying to stay aware of what he was doing. Seong-Il rubbed his eyes nervously. His view became dim and slowly returned to its original state.</p>
<p>Then, he saw something. He had barely escaped from the land of the plague, but there was a swamp in front of him. It was the home of the Maruka Clan. The things that were moving around limply were not reeds. Instead, they were the monsters’ tentacles, and the things that were stretching out of the popping bubbles were the Maruka’s clones.</p>
<p>The habitat of Maruka was in front of him, and the Barba army’s pursuers were behind him. In the middle, he was suffering from plague and wounds. Seong-Il smiled, realizing that he was now in the perfect scenario to meet his death. Although his protective barrier was slowly charging up, that wasn’t enough to save himself from the perfectly combined grip of death. Seong-Il stopped walking when he saw a human shape walking out of Maruka’s habitat. Maruka that walked on two legs were likely aristocrats.</p>
<p>He remarked, “Ah, I’m going to die soon.”</p>
<p>He was sincerely regretful that he had wasted Ja-Seong’s sacrifice and also felt ashamed that he had failed to live up to Odin. Above all, he had lots of regrets when thought of his ex-wife’s old boyfriend taking care of Ki-Cheol as his son. However, he was relieved that they wouldn’t be able to have a baby together as that old man’s dick wouldn’t stand up due to age. He was a bougie guy, so Seong-Il thought he would pay for Ki-Cheol’s tuition in the future.</p>
<p>“Well, if he dies of old age before that, all of his money will go to my ex, and Ki-Cheol will have a better life. Ah, my son is going to have a better life than mine. Haha.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il erased the smile on his face, and the light of life and death flashed in his eyes. However, it soon disappeared because the creature that was approaching him was a monster that he was well acquainted with. It wasn’t a Maruka. It was a human… no, the guy who was stuck with Odin. Orca.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>While the Barba pursuers were stranded in Orca’s habitat, Seong-Il was being carried somewhere while being tied to Orca’s tentacles. The tentacles that were growing out of its robe weren’t aggressive at all. Instead, they were clenching him loosely such that Seong-Il could escape from them if he wanted to.</p>
<p>However, there were quite a lot of Orca’s clones who rushed toward Seong-Il like the Barba rats. He knew Orca was protecting him as his plague level was no longer rising. Deformed tentacles sprang up from his wounds and wriggled hideously, but it was better than being insanely itchy. Therefore, Seong-Il didn’t resist his current state and instead took the time to catch his breath.</p>
<p>It seemed like Orca was heading toward a boundary. It wasn’t a boundary created by a Light Pillar. The inside and outside were blocked by a subtle golden light instead of being transparent. At that moment, two names crossed his mind.</p>
<p>Odin! Doom Dejire!</p>
<p>Doom Dejire was no longer crying, but the closer he got to them, the more the creepy energy began to overwhelm him. Seong-Il ground his teeth together. He was certain that Orca was having a difficult time carrying him. All of Orca’s clones that had been chasing Seong-Il were now gone. Orca put Seong-Il down in a crack that had formed in the boundary. The rays of light were filling the gap, but he could definitely see the inside of the boundary.</p>
<p>“...!”</p>
<p>He couldn’t feel it outside because of the boundary, but it was clear that a powerful vortex was sweeping everything in there. Sparks of lightning bounced off wildly, and a huge amount of blood was circling around. Delicate and soft things like flesh and small bones would have pulverized into mush in there. The large fragments of bones that were circling around were the Skeletal Dragon’s body. In fact, Seong-Il could see the dragon’s skull in there, which had been split in half. Other debris were also fiercely rotating like tops, and he thought they were items.</p>
<p>Then, Seong-Il widened his eyes. It was right after he exploded his Sense to the peak because he couldn’t miss this moment. One thing that appeared for one second and exploded was definitely Odin’s arm. Then, he saw Odin’s sliced body.</p>
<p>“Odiiiiin-!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I felt like I could hear Seong-Il’s voice in the end, but I had already been sucked into the darkness. All that existed there were me and the messages.</p>
<p>[You have exterminated Doom Dejire.]</p>

<p>[You have fulfilled the conditions required to complete the quest.]</p>
<p>[You have completed the quest ‘The Birth of Doom Man (3).’]</p>
<p>I heard a heart beating loudly, so I thought I was back in my mother’s womb. Even when I realized that the sounds were coming from Yeon-Hee’s heart, the notification message continued to appear.</p>
<p>[Congratulations! You have finally completed the linked quest ‘The Birth of Doom Man.’]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 307</p>
<p>The remaining linked quests were automatically completed as soon as I finished the first quest. Apparently, their requirements had been met. I had been forced to carry out ‘The Birth of Doom Man’t from the very beginning. It was both a shackle and the last resort for me.</p>
<p>At that moment, the notification message confirmed that the quest had been completed.</p>
<p>Crackle-!</p>
<p>A red light spread right in front of me, and it pierced through all kinds of emotions and thoughts. The fire could burn even my soul, and it was stretching out while a red circular shape was filling the front. It was huge, and I got scared. The whole world surrounding me was engulfed by the red light. Then, it became dark again. When the red light colored the space again, I saw the eye.</p>
<p>Doom Kaos!</p>
<p>Doom Kaos was gazing at me. It was different from when I had encountered it before I was sealed. I was in the Life Vessel, but I couldn’t resist the feeling of being locked up by it. I was under a pressure, and the feeling I felt at the moment was terrifying fear.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>I wanted to believe that my mind was being manipulated. A certain degree of fear was always necessary, but death was inevitable as soon as someone froze. If I could have escaped, then I would have done so without looking back. Well, I would have been kneeling down by him before that…</p>
<p>However, his gaze had a peculiar and dreadful vibe, and it was hard to describe in human terms. If I had to try, then I could only say that it could be explained as ‘apprehension/distrust’ or ‘a cluster of various consciousnesses.’ It was connected to the truth about the being that was called the Old One. The Old One hadn’t been in our dimension for that long as it had confronted Doom Kaos by shifting into multiple dimensions earlier. When Doom Kaos was after a certain dimension, the Old One appeared there too.</p>
<p>However, I wouldn’t make snap judgments on what was evil versus good. My opinion would be nothing but dust in a space war that was being fought by two transcendent beings.</p>
<p>Even if things were as black and white as Doom Kaos being evil and the Old One being good, nothing had changed for my perspective. The most important thing was my family and the safety of mankind. All of these hardships I had been going through were only for these two points. What the two did didn’t matter to me as long as I could achieve that.</p>
<p>I shouted, “Just guarantee one thing for me. The safety of humanity, so that you will stop attacking our dimension. Then, I’ll be your man and fight against the Old One. It means I’ll give you everything you want including the vitality, soul, and the earth. Just point where you want me to attack!”</p>
<p>The mainland of the Seven Demon Kings was at peace and their civilizations had remained intact. I was always ready to sacrifice my soul if our land could be guaranteed that way. It was a bummer that I was in the life vessel and could only communicate like this. If I had a physical body, I would have done what Joshua had done upon seeing me: go on one knee and calling Doom Kaos ‘Master.’</p>
<p>[You have inherited the position of Doom Dejire.]</p>
<p>A notification message popped up, and I took it as a contract with Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>[Doom Caso will be afraid of you from now on.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Doom Kaos disappeared along with the red light that had filled the world. It became dark again, but surprisingly, nothing had changed. This was because my revival hadn’t taken place yet. I wondered how long it would take before I could revive, how it would happen, and what would happen to the power of the Old One inside me. Then, a notification message appeared.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Revival): 29 days 23 hours 59 minutes 49 seconds]</p>
<p>The bolded messages seem to have been sent by Doom Kaos. Also, apparently I was still stuck with this system even though I was now included in his camp. Well, I wanted to avoid making eye contact with its eye whenever something happened.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Yeon-Hee’s heart rate was accelerating, and the moment when I focused on the sound was when my view opened up. The world had brightened up. Of course, I was looking through Yeon-Hee’s vision. After all, she was the only person with such skinny and small arms who could slaughter Baclan warriors in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>I could also hear the roar of Kciphos King Gundrak, Yeon-Hee’s pet, in the distance. A high-ranking Baclan warrior that had been controlled by Yeon-Hee had just been decapitated by its own kind. The monster that killed it was Yeon-Hee’s next target, then it ended up dying in a similar way.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee. Hey, Yeon-Hee! Can you hear me?</p>
<p>There was no response, so she must not have realized that I was inside her, my Life Vessel, after I died. Anyway, I had joined Doom Kaos’s side, but the Seven Demon Kings’ attack hadn’t stopped. I wondered if it was because I was in the middle of a war or if Doom Kaos didn’t value human Awakened or its soldiers. It was too early to jump to conclusions.</p>
<p>[Guild: Mary’s Corps has succeeded in defending the first-floor boundary.]</p>
<p>[Until the first weakening: 6 days 4 hours 1 minute 3 seconds]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee called in her pet over, and everywhere she walked past with the Kciphos in her arms was filled with Baclan’s bodies. The number of dead Awakened outweighed the Baclans.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee scanned the bodies meticulously, and she focused on high-quality equipment a little longer than basic ones. Every time she collected an item, I could see the information window that she was looking at. The bulky equipment had been put aside, and most were B-class accessories.</p>
<p>Then, I heard a whispering sound from the distance, and some people dared to call Yeon-Hee a witch.</p>
<p>Ssss-</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee moved immediately. After the scenery passed by quickly, I saw the backs of those who were running away. The question was how did they grasp that Yeon-Hee was chasing them and running away. They had no choice but to stop when she made a noise.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was impressed because I was certain that she would slaughter them. However, she was asking in a bright tone. She was calm even when she heard the party calling her a witch earlier.</p>
<p>“You guys should introduce yourself since it’s our first time seeing each other.”</p>
<p>Despite Yeon-Hee’s efforts, no one answered. She pointed at one guy, and he froze as if he was facing a ghost. I had acted the exact same way a few hours ago when I saw Doom Kaos’s gaze.</p>
<p>“Who are you?” she asked.</p>
<p>He stuttered, “I… I am Raphael… from Diego Attack Squad. I’m under Diego Rodriguez in the third unit.”</p>
<p>“Under the third unit of the Mary Corps,” she corrected him.</p>
<p>He nodded frantically. “Yes, yes. I am directly under Diego Rodriguez of the Mary Corps’s third unit.”</p>
<p>“Tell me, Raphael. What’s the matter?” she asked congenially.</p>
<p>There were four other people around him, and their bodies were turned towards the exit. They were ready to run away again at any time, but it was impossible since Yeon-Hee was in front of them. She was already aware of them, and the moment they ran, their necks would be sliced off or they would be killed by their colleagues. Even then, no one answered.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[The Clown's Dagger has been removed.]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee wrapped her fingers around the dagger’s handle, and she raised it as if she would stab his forehead. However, the direction of the blade’s tip changed to his chin. Even if she didn’t use much force, the dagger would vertically tear his face from his chin to his forehead.</p>
<p>She remarked casually, “Odin said that this dagger is pretty good. I still need to wait a long time to maximize its reinforcement, but I agree with him. Is there anyone with the Reinforcement insignia?”</p>
<p>“M… Ms…. Mary…” he began to plead.</p>
<p>She smiled slightly. “I was going to spare your life if you had it, but I guess you don’t.”</p>
<p>“Please…” he begged.</p>
<p>She continued lightly, “Witches don’t just take one’s mind away. We can also curse too.”</p>
<p>Her words sounded like a joke, but they had a strong, murderous undercurrent.</p>
<p>“Choose. Do you want me to control your mind or curse you?” Yeon-Hee asked cruelly.</p>
<p>He squeaked, “I… I don’t want… either… We were just…”</p>
<p>“Can you afford to explain things properly now?”</p>
<p>He confessed, “We were just discussing what popped up. Odin said that he had handled all the malicious parts of the System, so we wondered why this quest showed up… That’s really all. Please trust me. The System is telling us to kill you, Ms. Mary. You should be careful…”</p>
<p>This was the first time I was able to see how Yeon-Hee read the memories and thoughts of her targets. Although her overall ability was inferior to Doom Dejire’s, her speed of skimming through the target’s recent memory was fast. Then, she found the notification in question.</p>

<p>* A quest item (Location Seeker) will be awarded.</p>
<p>* Don’t worry. Mary has not received an assassination quest in return.</p>
<p>* The quest also provides a great number of XP.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I had wondered if the Old One had originally planned to treat me like the dog it would kill after hunting down one Doom. Anyway, the bloody Old One wouldn’t have given such a quest to only these guys. It was trying to lead everyone to kill Yeon-Hee and eventually cause me to truly die.</p>
<p>Anyone would have noticed that this quest would bring them huge benefits even without reading the flowery language on the names of the quest start items and privileges. From the sheer number of Challenger boxes being offered in the decision, I could tell how much the Old One wanted to kill me.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee took her eyes off the notification message in the guy’s memory and began to search her quest window. The assassination quest was usually two-way, but it was different this time. It was true. There was no assassination quest for Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>She finally murmured, “...It has been a while. It’s gotten worse.”</p>
<p>“Pardon me?” the guy asked.</p>
<p>She looked at him. “Nothing. Anyway, you guys must really want to kill me because I do too.”</p>
<p>He begged, “P… Please don’t kill us. We really were only discussing what had happened. Guys, say something.”</p>
<p>He looked at the tip of the blade touching his chin and turned to look at his colleagues. Even then, Yeon-Hee’s eyes were fixed on his face, so I couldn’t see her patting the Kciphos. However, I was sure that she was touching the monster because I heard the small noise that it always made when she stroked its fur.</p>
<p>Grrrrrrr-</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee soon pulled away her dagger. The Clown’s Dagger moved like a living creature in her grip, then disappeared into the storage box. Contrary to my expectations, she left the scared guys intact. Following that, she kept looking at her pet. I could see that she was doing her best in trying to calm down as she continued to stroke her pet.</p>
<p>After the battle, executives were returning one after another to the boundary on the seventh floor. They all looked at Yeon-Hee in the same way. They were thirsty for the quest rewards. It was obvious that they were trying to hide their intentions from her as they tried to calculate their success rates in achieving the goal. Their eyes gleamed with a mixture of that and the fear they had of her.</p>
<p>“Okay, guys. Eyes on me.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee drew more attention toward herself like a middle school teacher.</p>
<p>“Raise your hand if you got the quest,” Yeon-Hee said this in a calm and playful tone, but no one believed that she was in a delightful mood. Everyone raised their hand, and they exchanged looks. They seemed to be preparing for all possibilities. My view shook up and down as Yeon-Hee nodded.</p>
<p>[Your Empathy has been activated.]</p>
<p>“You guys are all annoying, but you two drive me crazy.”</p>
<p>Then, things happened.</p>
<p>[You have used Isis’s Gaze.]</p>
<p>[Target: The Worst Guy 1]</p>
<p>One of the executives suddenly rose, and he threw himself straight at another executive sitting next to him. Cold energy wrapped around his weapon, and the resulting ice tail feathered out as he hit the top of his opponent’s head.</p>
<p>Everyone was exhausted after the battle, so the victim couldn't react. Also, the executive Yeon-Hee chose was stronger than the others. The power of the hit was strong, and the freezing effect that quickly immobilized the opponent spread from the area of a shock downward. He kicked the victim over, then accurately struck the victim’s face after pulling the victim’s upper body between his feet.</p>
<p>Then, he alternately looked at me, no… Yeon-Hee with furious eyes. He seemed to be waiting for her order.</p>
<p>She continued mildly, “Let me say one thing. If you don’t want to die, just watch. I don’t want to ruin everything.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s view briefly shook up and down toward the executive who was being manipulated by her. Then, his violent attack resumed.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>Blood splattered and pieces of flesh bounced off in all directions. Even towards Yeon-Hee.</p>

<p>Chapter 308</p>
<p>“Does anyone know about the privileges?”</p>
<p>“...Have you seen Osiris and his squad?”</p>
<p>“I would rather die. I can’t live like that. The high-ranking people told me that Osiris looks the same way.”</p>
<p>“Stop talking about them behind their backs. If you have the guts to say that in front of them, I’ll call you my father forever.”</p>
<p>“Hehe. Go on. Why did you mention Osiris?”</p>
<p>“Those from Revolucion (12) and the World Awakened Association(1) during Act Two, Stage One experienced something that we haven’t. Oh damn. Does no one know about this? This is disappointing.”</p>
<p>“You are talking about something that happened ages ago. How do you know that it was something we haven’t been through? I’m not asking this because I don’t trust you. We should be careful. There are a couple who died because of false rumors.”</p>
<p>“I heard about them.”</p>
<p>“From one of them?</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“From one of the guys in Osiris’s squad?”</p>
<p>“No, the one from the other side.”</p>
<p>“The resident in the Savior’s city?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Wait, let’s get the facts straight. Are you a fanatic too…?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but there was nothing wrong with what they said. Now we all know that. But does that matter?”</p>
<p>“I’m asking if you are a fanatic or not.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“You’d better make sure. If you are a fanatic, then get out of here. If not, then just sit down. If you are going to leave, then make sure you know this one thing that you have already put your foot in here.”</p>
<p>“Do we really have to continue this conversation? If you don’t trust me, then I have no reason to trust you.”</p>
<p>“Sorry.”</p>
<p>“You guys seem to despise the residents from the Savior’s city…”</p>
<p>“We don’t hate them. We just think they are creepy.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, they were the ones who had been with Odin the most, and many secrets have been revealed by them. From the reason why the malicious parts of the System are gone, to the existence of the Seven Demon Kings.”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>“Listen to me until the end. You all must know that Act Two, Stage One was an important turning point, so I won’t comment on that. However, it’s a surprise that you don’t know anything about this. I can’t believe strong men like you are not aware of the horrors of those days.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“In Act Two, Stage One, the so-called ‘top stages’ were destroyed. According to the people who are good at estimating, about twenty percent of the entire stage was evaporated through a single quest.”</p>
<p>“Quest?”</p>
<p>“It was a quest where three people were pulled into one group and only one out of the tree could survive.”</p>
<p>“Not any other time, but in Act Two, Stage One? The fucking shitty moment when we suffered from neverending night raids and traps? Well, the monsters will experience that shit now. Hehe.”</p>
<p>“What happened next is obvious. Even if the survivors cooperated, they still wouldn’t be able to protect the cities. They couldn’t afford to break the Light Pillar, even a small trap. Thus, all the leading groups at the time were exterminated.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe. All those strong players on the ‘top stages’ died back then? That’s something.”</p>
<p>“Maybe we were able to come all the way here because they are gone. Anyway, do you think you can complete Act Two, Stage One with a two-thirds reduction in force? Basically, what I’m trying to say is that Revolucion (12) and the World Awakened Association (1) were the stages that should have disappeared at that time.”</p>
<p>“But they managed to survive.”</p>
<p>“Only nine thousand people out of seventy thousand survived in Revolucion (12), and only ninety came out alive in Osiris’s World Awakened Association (1).”</p>
<p>“Gosh. Those who sit in the semicircle are different species from us. Osiris, Mary, …”</p>
<p>“First of all, I’ll put the Savior aside. I don’t want to say anything about him. But how did he, Osiris, survive Act Two, Stage One? In a situation where he must have died…”</p>
<p>“Oh, that’s what you are talking about? The Privilege?”</p>
<p>“The power to resist fate. The ability to create miracles. That’s how I want to define privileges. Fifty challenger boxes? Quest start items? A great deal of XP… Should I only focus on privileges?”</p>
<p>“Privilege of ‘Fast Growth’...even the name is dope. Don’t you think I’ll be able to reach the challenger section right away if I get all those XP from the Privilege? By the way, his whereabouts are crucial…”</p>
<p>They continued to whisper.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>「You have seen it yourself, haven’t you?」</p>
<p>「I was only thinking about rewards back then. I was staring at Mary’s neck, but she only killed Rodriguez.」</p>
<p>「That’s good. Otherwise, no one would have been able to intervene, including me. But you shouldn’t be relieved too early. Mary is trying to rule by punishing Rodriguez as a warning to the others. And think about it. Mary’s Mind Control skill doesn’t seem to have a cooldown time. The quantity doesn’t matter to her. She will make us kill ourselves and fight for her like the way she made the Baclans turn on each other. In fact, it’s very dangerous for us to even have this discussion.」</p>
<p>「Then, how did May die[1]? Moreover, Mary’s Empathy ability is probably even better now than it was before. I wonder if she can get quality sleep at night. It is bound to be fatal to her. What if those with mental attributes go crazy?」</p>
<p>「Then, they cause slaughter.」</p>
<p>「The shit show that Mary will cause will be even more devastating, so I’ll find the opportunity then. If I succeed, I will distribute half of the fifty challenger boxes to you guys. All items. I’m not going to take them all by myself.」</p>
<p>「I trust you, and I have never violated your rules.」</p>
<p>「I’m also afraid of Mary. She is fucking scary. But I want the items from killing her more than anything.」</p>
<p>「I understand, but I want you to stop. At times like this, you should show loyalty to Mary so that everything comes up rosy for now. Everyone knows that Mary is the savior’s girl, sir. Also, do you think those who sit in the semicircle would overlook this?」</p>
<p>「That’s why this must end before they arrive. Before they take up the reward. It will be after the first weakening.」</p>
<p>「I don’t think so. You should never show any sign until it is confirmed that the fight between him and Doom Deijire ended in victory. Of course, there’s no way to hide one’s feelings, but that’s what has happened to Mary anyway… 」</p>
<p>「I have no intention of moving hastily until Mary starts slaughtering people.」</p>
<p>「No, sir. Even if that happens, you shouldn’t think about quests only for survival. People sitting in the semicircle have stronger ties than you think.」</p>
<p>「Some people have deluded themselves that they were better than others. But why would they have died at my hands if they were better than me? Why didn’t they get my spot?」</p>
<p>「I am so sorry. I was being presumptuous.」</p>
<p>「Do you believe that Doom Kaos is focusing all of his malicious intention on the savior?」</p>
<p>「Yes, sir.」</p>
<p>「So why do you think the System has given out an assassination quest at this point? Because the savior is up against Doom Dejire? According to the logic of the ‘residents of the savior’s city,’ he passed away.」</p>
<p>「If Doom Dejire defeated Odin, then why is it so quiet? Oh... I… I crossed the line again. I’m sorry. I’ll figure out more about the situation.」</p>
<p>「Is this quiet? You will find out sooner or later. If neither Odin nor Doom Dejire appear, it means Odin is dead.」</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s correct.」</p>
<p>「Then, who will succeed him in power? Mary? Osiris? The King of Hell? Lee Tae-Han? I’m certain that the guy who kills Mary and takes the reward will be the one. This is not limited to those who sit in the semicircle. This also applies to us, the thirty people who sit in the five rows in front of them. It’s possible since there are fifty challenger boxes. It still makes sense even if I share the half with you.」</p>
<p>「That’s right.」</p>
<p>「All the strong men of the corps will come to kill Mary. They will come before or after the first weakening by breaking through monsters.」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>「You probably wonder if Mary could ever live to the end and occupy what had been Odin’s power.」</p>
<p>「No, she’s become the public enemy, so I don’t see that happening.」</p>
<p>「So, we have five more days. Exactly 5 days 18 hours 22 minutes 40 seconds. The time left until the first weakening is our only chance to kill Mary.」</p>
<p>「Yes.」</p>
<p>「But we should also go through the scenario if Mary doesn’t kill anyone during that period. We should also not question whether Odin really lost or not.」</p>
<p>「Give me the order, please.」</p>
<p>「If nothing happens until the first weakening, then go through the central area faster than anyone else and check if Odin is actually dead.」</p>
<p>「If he is still fighting against Doom Dejire or if he is there for any other reason, I will return as soon as possible and report to you.」</p>
<p>「Yes, you can take all the necessary supplies like A-Class insignias. Mary wouldn’t be able to afford to think that far.」</p>
<p>「Let me say one last thing. Things will go quickly if Odin was killed or, if, for whatever reason, Doom Dejire meddles with us.」</p>
<p>「I will prepare contingencies for something like that. We should admit that our group is inferior to others now, but if we take advantage of the preparation time, we will have an opportunity.」</p>
<p>「Yes, sir.」</p>
<p>「Trust me. I will remove Mary and sit in the center of the semicircle.」</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee killed an executive to set an example, but people continued planning on how to backstab her.</p>
<p>Fucking bastards.</p>
<p>Those who only heard about the greatness of Sense in the challenger section didn’t know how far it could be increased. They were trying their best to whisper, and some even passed notes to converse with each other.</p>
<p>I could hear pencils squeaking everywhere, but there was a moment when all the sounds disappeared. It happened when Yeon-Hee suppressed her Sense, which was very dangerous.</p>
<p>[You have blocked Empathy.]</p>
<p>She even turned off her trait, but fortunately, she did it temporarily as she knew the consequences of dropping her Sense to the level of civilians. In the meantime, Yeon-Hee had been recovering her bright personality. I was concerned that she would become negative again.</p>
<p>“Ah, I can’t stand this. I have no choice but to check. What? I shouldn’t go to the central area?” she mumbled.</p>
<p>Of course, she wasn’t responding to Kciphos as it couldn’t talk to her. She was just pretending to have a conversation with her pet.</p>
<p>“Then, what should I do? I’m going to lose my mind if I stay here longer. Again and again… No. They don’t deserve to live, but I really don’t want to do that. No!”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee couldn’t sleep that night.</p>
<p>The next day, Location Seekers began to pile up in her room as her subordinates were collecting them as she had ordered. However, she knew that she couldn’t retrieve all of them in this world.</p>
<p>These items were naturally destroyed if the owners died or the duration of the quest ended. However, there were bound to be cases where people were reported as dead and were actually alive with the Location Seeker.</p>
<p>There were at least a hundred thousand people in Yeon-Hee’s corps, and if there were unrecovered seekers, then they were definitely aiming at her back. On the surface, it seemed like things were going smoothly and quietly. Even the desperation of the Baclans, who tried breaking the boundary[2] on the first floor and the Awakened trying to protect the boundary looked like nothing worse would happen.</p>
<p>However, there were thousands of eyes chasing her inside the boundary, and it was noisy with sounds coming from everyone. Yeon-Hee was drying up. She was barely holding herself by compromising her Sense and Empathy, but she was getting weakened as she lost her appetite.</p>
<p>The incident happened a day before the first weakening.</p>
<p>1. Not a typo, this person named May apparently existed.</p>
<p>2. The multiple layers of 'trap' in the red zone (light pillar) should actually be 'boundary' instead. We'll be changing all instances of 'trap' in this context from ch258. Apologies for the confusion!</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 309</p>
<p>It wasn’t just because of the sound. Yeon-Hee could feel all the murderous intentions toward her from a distance. She was locked up in a prison made of such things. Her corps was buzzing that day too.</p>
<p>“Let’s assume that Odin has eliminated the malice of the System. Then, where did the quest come from? Is it from the System itself? ‘She is not just a danger to everyone. Her presence is the worst of the worst.’ That is what the quest says.”</p>
<p>“There are rumors that Odin’s death revived the evil of the System. Then, this must be the Seven Demon King’s ploy to help the monsters. They are giving rise to an internal conflict. Do you remember?”</p>
<p>“But the reward is unbelievable…”</p>
<p>“It’s awesome, but we can’t covet them. What about the battle?”</p>
<p>“Authorities will judge that giving off one or two boundaries to us wouldn’t mean much. That’s why this has been such a mess. Let’s get in.”</p>
<p>“I agree. Where would be the best place?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean where? Of course, somewhere that guarantees a challenger box. I hope we are not too late.”</p>
<p>People talked about getting rewards rather than stories of dead soldiers in battles. Yeon-Hee had become more sensitive, and she hadn’t eaten and slept much for the past five days. She remained still while looking at the bodies of the Baclans that lay next to her feet after she had slaughtered them.</p>
<p>She listened to the sound of conversations coming from all directions, then began to shake her head vigorously. When she stopped, there was only darkness in her vision.</p>
<p>A frustrating message popped up.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Revival): 24 days 20 hours 58 minutes 48 seconds]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s heart rate suddenly began to go through the roof, and it didn’t settle down. If she was a civilian, then her blood pressure would have made her explode. When she opened her eyes, her vision was slightly blurred. It was a sign of an emergency.</p>
<p>From then on, Yeon-Hee scampered differently than usual. She stopped for a moment and saw the pieces of monster leather burning on the ground. It was the leftover traces from the people who had had a secret conversation. She noticed that the information written on the leather could be only handled by executives who had the authority to control troops and supplies. Yeon-Hee kicked the fire, and the pieces soared into the air in the embers.</p>
<p>「Item: ??? *8</p>
<p>Stored Location: ??? Golden Eagle Attack Squad, Sione ??? 」</p>
<p>「Item: Insignia (???) *1, ??? (Protection B) *6 , Insignia Barrier C *2</p>
<p>Stored Location: Squad 5 ??? ???? ???? 」</p>
<p>「Item: ??? (Holy Spring B) *1, Insignia (Speed-up B) *1 , Insignia ??? *6</p>
<p>Stored Location: ??? Amanda Attack Squad, Sda[1] Kentaro 」</p>
<p>However, it wasn’t those things that made her heart beat hard. It was because she saw the things on the bottom side of the paper that had not yet burned away in flames.</p>
<p>「Act One, Stage One: Not confirmed.</p>
<p>- I couldn’t find anyone who started the Stage of Advent with her. Also, no one was aware of her activities of the time. There is no data to infer Mary’s identity in the outside world.</p>
<p>Act One, Stage Two: She worked as the leader of the central area. It was confirmed that she attacked the last floor of the seven-floor spire by herself. She was known for being friendly and had a good reputation.</p>
<p>Act One, Final Stage: It was confirmed that she went mad during the stage unification process within the preparation period. Two women, who used to be Mary’s close personnels from Act One, Stage Two, died. Her whereabouts were unknown after ㅡadness, but she resumed her activities at the end of the Final Stage. However, she wasn’t involved in group work.</p>
<p>- The code name ‘Mary’ would arise at this time.</p>
<p>Act Two, Stage One: She was greatly involved at the end of the Light Pillar attack quest. It was assumed that she secured the insignia Light Pillar during this period. She stopped intervening in group affairs starting from then on.</p>
<p>Act Two, Stage Two: She resumed activities from the middle of Act Two. Since then, she hasn’t secluded herself from society like she did during Act Two, Stage One, and began to reign as the group’s top leader.</p>
<p>- Top leader: A big shot who controlled the guild leader and commanders without securing the guild leader's position.</p>
<p>Act Two, Stage Three: She prioritized completing collection quests instead of corps quests when the Graf Clan invaded the group. Therefore, a lot of damage and complaints occurred inside the guild, but there was no impact on her authority.</p>
<p>- It was confirmed that she has lived with minimal sleep and meals since then.</p>
<p>Act Two, Stage Four: Mary herself believes that she has achieved the most growth during this period. It was always Mary and her attack squad who completed the B-class dungeon quest , ‘Evaporation of Cities.’</p>
<p>- Mary’s attack squad is being operated as a last resort. The guild leader was changed from time to time due to many reasons. Most of them died during battles or in a dungeon.</p>
<p>- People from Revolucion( 30) who joined her corps in Act Two, Stage Five started calling her ‘Evil’ from this point.</p>
<p>- Two big incidents happened that led her to burst into anger. All were confirmed to have happened because they had violated Mary’s orders. No similar cases have occurred since then.</p>
<p>Act Two, Stage Five: Odin joined the group. It was also confirmed that the two defeated the necromancer during this period.</p>
<p>- Odin was presumed to have a superior ability that allowed him to jump over stages.</p>
<p>- Many circumstances were discovered and confirmed that Mary is Odin’s girl.</p>
<p>Basic considerations:</p>
<p>! The general commanders, whose main attributes are related to fire, should be armed with mental protection insignias or high-quality items that have similar characteristics.</p>
<p>! They should have the additional ability to confront Mary’s pet, the King of Kciphos Gundrak. I have included extra information about the pet.</p>
<p>! Mary’s skill ‘Mind Control’ is not effective from a distance, so all attacks must be carried out from afar.</p>
<p>! The best time to attack her is when she is out of her mind.</p>
<p>Attack Scenario 1 (Restraint):</p>
<p>There is no way to escape Mary from chasing us. Attack formation should always spread out like the spokes of a wheel. Under the assumption that Mary will target one attack squad, every team must have at least one A-class Restraint insignia. If the restraint is successful, then we should accept the sacrifice of the targeted squad and attack her while maximizing explosive damage.</p>
<p>Probability of success - very low.</p>
<p>Attack Scenario 2 (Mental):</p>
<p>This method takes advantage of the characteristics that attack power increases as psychotic attacks form a coalition. By organizing a separate team of the mental squad in the corps, Mary’s…」</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee ran while holding the leather in her hands.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The owner of the leather was one of the executives, and he was in charge of approximately ten thousand Awakened. In fact, he was prepared, but all his insignias did was buy him a little time. He could never escape from Yeon-Hee no matter how far he ran away inside the boundary.</p>
<p>When Yeon-Hee almost caught up with him, he was screaming that she had gone mad. However, the noise vanished once Yeon-Hee got on his back. Her dagger thrust made him powerless, and his shield quickly lost its defense power every time she stabbed him. He tried every means to shake her off, but the more he tried, the more the force from Yeon-Hee’s feet strangled him into submission.</p>
<p>In the end, he was left with bare skin without a protective barrier. There was no one around to help him. This was also because he had messed up the surroundings by overusing the same skills over and over.</p>
<p>“Please…” he begged.</p>
<p>He probably wanted to ask her to spare his life, but her answer was endless stabbing. She was furious and had lost her mind.</p>
<p>Sqwelp! Shunk! Plorkk!</p>
<p>She didn’t stop even when he stopped breathing. When it became impossible to hack him more… When his head fell off, Yeon-Hee looked around for an object to vent her anger. Even at that time, the roar of Kciphos was ringing in the distance. I had no intention of stopping Yeon-Hee. Well... I couldn’t anyway. Her ragged breathing sounded like crying to me.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee turned toward the boundary on the seventh floor where the Light Pillar was located. It was where executives had to gather after each battle. Yeon-Hee ran precariously as she almost touched the magic traps that were installed all over the boundary multiple times.</p>
<p>It was right before she was about to enter the boundary on the seventh floor. She detected a large-scale movement. The noise from the troops stationed in the first floor and the executives who entered the seventh floor buzzed in Yeon-Hee’s ears extremely loudly. The sounds that she had ignored roared in her ears as her Sense had increased.</p>
<p>The methods that people came up to kill her were all different, but the goals were all the same. Whatever choice she made, I was definitely on Yeon-Hee’s side. Even if it was an abnormal and brutal choice.</p>
<p>However, Yeon-Hee stopped running all of a sudden. The sound of her short breath gradually turned into a painful groan. My view became dark again as she had wrapped her hands around her face. It was then that her heartbeat slowed down. It still pounded faster than usual, but it was back to normal compared to the previous pace.</p>
<p>The Second Evil once rampaged wildly. When she went wild, it took a long time for her to calm down. The information written on the monster leather stated the optimal time for the attack was when she lost her mind, but that was wrong. The guy who wrote it was not well acknowledged with the mental system.</p>
<p>Anyway, Yeon-Hee calmed down in a few minutes. Then, she muttered while looking at her bloodstained hands.</p>
<p>“No, no, no. No… Not here…”</p>
<p>She bumped into many people as she went down the first floor, but there was no battle. The Awakened were on their way to the seventh floor to attend a convocation that the executives held, so there was no specific order to confront her.</p>
<p>There were some commanders who seemed to have worked on the attack scenarios on the leather. Those with rebellious eyes and those who were waiting for orders from higher-ups came up to tie Yeon-Hee up while pretending like they were reporting the situation. However, they often made way for her with their blackened eyes.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee soon arrived at the boundary of the first floor, where the Kciphos was massacring people. The Awakened there seemed to have no way out of Kciphos’s rampage as they had just finished the fierce battle against the Baclans.</p>
<p>There were people who participated in the battle as emergency power and didn’t actually fight the Kciphos. In other words, they had been recruited separately to kill Yeon-Hee, and they were the ones confronting her pet.</p>
<p>They found Yeon-Hee and shouted, “Are you going to just stand there and watch?”</p>
<p>The Kciphos returned to Yeon-Hee and had many wounds. She held her injured pet and headed in the same direction, toward the outside of the boundary. No one stopped her, and she stopped for a moment while looking at the distant scene after stepping out.</p>
<p>The cloud of dust was dense in the air which reminded me of the sand wind from afar. The Baclans who had left the battlefield were getting ready for the next war. There was not much time left for them.</p>
<p>[Until the first weakening: 23 hours 35 minutes 42 seconds]</p>
<p>When that time passed, their original attack power would begin to weaken. The Baclans also knew that their power wouldn’t be enough to confront Awakened, so it was expected that monsters would launch an all-out attack soon before the time limit ended.</p>
<p>In the midst of the dust, I saw a human shape that the Baclans couldn’t see. She was small compared to them, but tall for a human woman. I was able to see her clearly as Yeon-Hee had focused her attention on that person.</p>
<p>It was Lee Soo-Ah, and she looked the same as before. However, neither the equipment she was wearing nor the language she was wearing was the same. Yeon-Hee looked at her and the endless Baclan Corps then turned her head back.</p>
<p>There were many Awakened looking at Yeon-Hee even on the boundary of the first floor. If Yeon-Hee was absent, there was no guarantee that her corps would succeed in defending the boundary. It was true that Yeon-Hee’s vacancy meant a lot to her group.</p>
<p>She started to step toward the Baclan Corps as if she had finished debating. To be exact, she was moving as far away from the boundary as possible. However, she didn’t seem to have the intention to fight against the Baclans. She was able to erase her presence from the opponents’ eyes, but she didn’t do that. That was also why I had designated her as my Life Vessel.</p>

<p>Chapter 310</p>
<p>However, Yeon-Hee seemed to have no intention of breaking through Lee Soo-Ah and the elite Baclans. Of course, even she wouldn’t have been able to fight against all of them, but it was possible for her to avoid their attacks and pass through them. Nevertheless, the reason why she was detouring to avoid Lee Soo-Ah was because of the Life Vessel. She was playing it safe.</p>
<p>“As long as you don't do anything to me, Lee Soo-Ah, I’ll do the same to you,” Yeon-Hee muttered to herself as she looked at the other woman, who was getting farther away.</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Ah wouldn’t have actually heard her voice. The Baclan’s main force didn’t follow Yeon-Hee, and the formation along the boundary remained unchanged. Lee Soo-Ah let her go, so she passed smoothly through the outskirts.</p>
<p>When she put the Baclan Corps behind her back, a red light burst from the direction where Lee Soo-Ah was standing.</p>
<p>[Corps: Warning. Lee Soo-Ah, the general commander of the Baclans, has used a mysterious spell.]</p>
<p>Woooah! Woooooh!</p>
<p>The Baclans started roaring, and their all-out attack on the boundary began again. The warriors were rushing toward the boundary, and the flying soldiers descended rapidly like a meteor shower.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee uttered toward the Awakened inside the boundary, “You all should go to hell.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Guild: Mary’s Corps has failed to defend the first floor boundary (Baclan Corps).]</p>
<p>[Mary’s Corps: 85,320]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (First Weakening) has been reset.]</p>
<p>This was a vacant spot where the monster corps didn’t exist. In other words, Yeon-Hee couldn’t see the Baclans anymore, and she was about to reach the Barba’s plague zone in a few hours. An hour later, Yeon-Hee received a quest. The Old One was a motherfucker with no conscience.</p>
<p>[The quest ‘Baclan’s Real Weapon’ has started.]</p>
<p>[Baclan’s Real Weapon (Quest)</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Ah, the general commander of the Baclan Corps, is a powerful sorcerer and healer. However, her real power must come from her mental abilities. That is probably why Lee Soo-Ah, who used to be an Awakened, has been recognized by the Baclan’s high-ranking sorcerers and became their leader.</p>
<p>Mission: Stop Lee Soo-Ah. Exterminate or Stop Her.</p>
<p>Class: A</p>
<p>Reward for Extermination: Challenger box * 3, Start item of the quest ‘Queen Baclan’s Armory,’ Start item of the quest ‘High-ranking Baclan Sorcerers’ Vision.’</p>
<p>Reward for Stopping: Challenger box * 1]</p>
<p>[Corps: Warning, You cannot stop Lee Soo-Ah, the general commander of the Baclan Corps.]</p>
<p>[Guild: Mary’s Corps has failed to defend the second floor’s boundary (Baclan Corps).]</p>
<p>[Mary’s Corps: 79,590]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (First Weakening) has been reset.]</p>
<p>[Until the first weakening: 23 hours 35 minutes 42 seconds]</p>
<p>[Guild: Baclan Corps is trying to break the boundary on the third floor that Mary’s Corps is protecting.]</p>
<p>Around that time, news about other corps popped up.</p>
<p>[Guild: Osiris’s Corps has succeeded in defending the boundary on the first floor (Barba Corps).]</p>
<p>[Guild: Osiris’s Corps has destroyed the altar (Barba Corps).]</p>
<p>[Guild: Barba Corps has entered the first round of weakening. Barba Corps’s offensive power will be significantly reduced.]</p>
<p>“Why…”</p>
<p>Her hair suddenly moved roughly from side to side while her arms stretched toward her head busily. She was messing up her hair out of a nervous habit.</p>
<p>Within my vision, her pet appeared with its face zoomed in. Blood was still dripping down from its face that was covered in fur. Although Yeon-Hee used her treatment skills whenever the cooldown time ended, it hadn’t fully recovered yet.</p>
<p>Now, Yeon-Hee was focused only on her pet, especially on the area where the Kciphos’ eyes were covered with fur. She brushed aside the fur. Then, the eyes of a predator that was extremely agitated became revealed.</p>
<p>She mumbled, “I’m so sorry to ask you this… If you have a chance, please take charge of Osiris’s attack squad. I’m terribly sorry, baby.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee tried her best, but she fell asleep without even realizing it. It was because she had been on edge for the past few days and had gone wild. When the darkness suddenly disappeared, I could see that Yeon-Hee was holding her pet and turning her head.</p>
<p>There was a guy approaching her quickly from the direction of the central area. Yeon-Hee had barely managed to wake herself up, so her vision was still quite limited. I saw a blurry view of golden armor. Then, I saw a thunder spear and a red cape fluttering at a breakneck speed.</p>
<p>When Yeon-Hee blinked her eyes, Seong-Il’s face appeared zoomed in. He didn’t seem to be in a good shape as tentacles were sticking out of my breastplate, which he was wearing. I couldn’t see much from here, but he definitely had massive wounds hiding inside the armor.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee moved faster and more stealthily than Seong-Il, so he couldn’t react properly to how quickly she rushed towards him. Within moments, she made eye contact with him at a close distance. From then on, what happened to Seong-Il began to unfold.</p>
<p>Seong-Il had been wailing while holding my body, but he couldn’t stay in grief for too long. The monsters that had been severely damaged and fled deep into the ground while I was fighting Doom Dejire soon came out of the ground. They were Grand Duke Amon and its clique.</p>
<p>Thus, Seong-Il had a tough fight against them along with Orca. The situation began to turn upside down after Seong-Il retrieved my items. Everything else that had been in my storage box was destroyed, but fortunately Odin’s Golden Armor, Ra’s Sun Cape, and Zeus’s Thunder Spear still were intact.</p>
<p>At that point, the two of them split up. Orca chased the Grand Duke while Seong-Il immediately headed to Yeon-Hee by using the Location Seeker. Those were all the memories I could check.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked away from Seong-Il, and he stumbled for a moment before finally regaining his balance.</p>
<p>He gasped out, “Noona.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il looked at Yeon-Hee with bloodshot eyes for a while. Although it looked like he had a lot to say, nothing came out of his mouth. Only his eyes trembled as if he didn’t know what to do.</p>
<p>“No, Odin will never die,” Yeon-Hee said. She looked downward, and her hand was placed on her chest where her heart was.</p>
<p>“I… I saw it. Noona… I… saw it, and I… couldn’t save him.” He sounded like he would burst into tears at any moment.</p>
<p>She asked, “Is that all he had left? What about the Skeletal Dragon? What happened to that?”</p>
<p>“Does that matter right now?” he wailed.</p>
<p>She asked again, “What about the returning stone?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Did you not hear me, noona? Odin… Odin died… But don’t worry. I’ll protect you. This quest wouldn’t have popped up just for me, right?”</p>
<p>“You saw Odin die, Seong-Il? With your own eyes, right?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il teared up instead of answering.</p>
<p>“Then, you shouldn’t be here,” Yeon-Hee said calmly.</p>
<p>Seong-Il looked flabbergasted. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“Do you think you can kill me if you stick to Joshua? It’s not just Joshua. Everyone is coming after me, so you’ll have to hurry up. You might be able to slice off my neck if you are lucky.”</p>
<p>He suddenly snarled, “What the hell are you talking about? Are you out of your mind? I’m Kwon Seong-Il.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee responded indifferently, “I’m saying all of this because I feel sorry for you.”</p>
<p>“More than that, why are you so indifferent about Odin’s death? Did I trust the wrong person?” Seong-Il asked angrily.</p>
<p>“Are you serious? You are going to stay with me? Next to the worst of the worst?” Yeon-Hee crowed sarcastically.</p>
<p>“You should know better, noona. Whatever!” Seong-Il shook his hand strongly.</p>
<p>Then, he continued, “This is not the time to chit-chat. Come to the central area with me. Orca will help us. It has no reason to be mean to you.”</p>
<p>“Did you just say ‘central area’?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il nodded. “That place must be a bit safer. Orca’s mud field would have expanded by now.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee replied, “Okay, fine. I can take care of myself, but you can’t. If you stay with me, you will die.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that I’m a burden?” Seong-Il asked a bit mournfully.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee shook her head. “No, not that. I’m saying I can’t protect you. But going there will help me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what you are talking about. I will protect you.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee sardonically asked, “You are protecting me? In that condition?”</p>
<p>“Are you really sure, noona? No matter who you are, crappy stuff can happen. No one knows what will happen. If that’s the case, I can at least buy you some time. Oh, and this.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il took off the golden armor. Then, he handed Ra’s Sun Cape and Zeus’s Thunder Spear to Yeon-Hee, and she accepted them.</p>
<p>He continued, “They are all fully charged.”</p>
<p>As expected, terrible cuts could be seen on Seong-Il’s chest after he took off the breastplate. When Yeon-Hee looked through his body, he took off the ring and handed it to her.</p>
<p>[* Inventory]</p>
<p>[The God of WInd’s Protective Ring has been added.]</p>
<p>“His name is Kang Ja-Seong. 051023-3482411. His dad is Kang Il-Koo, and his mom is Cho Soo-Yeon. If I die, please tell them how great he was. I owed him my life twice. If you take care of that, then I have nothing else to ask for.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you say that you have a son named Ki-Cheol?” Yeon-Hee abruptly asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il grimaced. “I can’t ask you to take care of him, too. But… I would appreciate it if you do, hehe. Argh!”</p>
<p>When Seong-Il uttered a groan, the tentacles all over his body wriggled.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said colony, “From the Maruka epidemic to the Barba plague… You have been infected by so many things.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il grunted, “I’ll pay you back what I owe Odin, so use me as much as you want.”</p>
<p>“...You have become more stupid. I don’t know how you managed to survive up to here as you are so soft. You are such a freak too.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe-Euk!”</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s smiling face crumpled, and pain spread all over his face.</p>
<p>She ordered, “Protect me by all means.”</p>
<p>He promised, “Yes, noona.”</p>
<p>[You have used Mary’s Hand.]</p>
<p>[Mary’s Hand (Skill)</p>
<p>Skill Class: A</p>
<p>Effect: Heals the causes of the target’s inability to fight. Recovers the target’s injuries to the maximum extent. Eliminates all negative effects such as diseases and curses at once.</p>
<p>Proficiency: LV. 7 (100%)</p>
<p>Cooldown Time: 5 days]</p>
<p>Seong-Il looked at Yeon-Hee in disbelief as the tentacles and scabs on his body disappeared all at once.</p>
<p>She said, “Did you forget about what I can do? I’m also a healer.”</p>
<p>Right then both of them stopped talking and turned their heads at the same time. When they climbed up to the highlands, they could vividly see a military force coming from the southwest direction. There were Joshua and his immediate attack squad at the forefront. Towards the rear side, there was a corps that reminded me of a monster army following them. It seemed like everyone in Joshua’s corps, including those who were supposed to be guarding the boundary, was pouring out after destroying one altar of the Barba Corps.</p>
<p>Seong-Il spat out what I wanted to say, “Those assholes. That’s why people say ‘some bite the hand that feeds them,’ noona. Let’s go to the central area for now.”</p>
<p>[Guild: The Baclan Corps is attempting to destroy the fourth floor boundary that Mary’s Corps is protecting.]</p>
<p>[Guild: Osiris’s Corps has failed to defend the boundary on the first floor (Barba Corps).]</p>
<p>[Guild: The Barba Corps is trying to destroy the second floor boundary that Osiris’s Corps is protecting.]</p>
<p>“Things are worse on Osiris’s side. It seems like they have left the boundary unattended.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il cursed, “...Fucking bastards. They have gone insane. Rewards shouldn’t be their priority because, at this pace, they will be all dead sooner or later. Monsters come first, not the rewards, ugh. Anyway, we should hurry, noona!”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee pointed to the direction in which the central area was located. There were also troops rushing through the central area.</p>
<p>“I guess it’s going to be the same even in the central area. Let’s cut off Osiris first. This is the only opportunity we have. If we let him stay alive, then he will keep annoying us. Also, his troops in the back are quite far from his immediate troops in the front.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee took out the new equipment from the inventory and handed them to Seong-Il after arming herself with my main items.</p>
<p>Seong-Il asked, “But who will protect you if I’m dead? Others will rush in from the other side after the first weakening is over. If you are the only one left… Don’t trust Lee Tae-Han or the King of Hell. They must be like Joshua, the asshole. I have nothing much to tell you about the King of Hell since I don’t know him that well, but Lee Tae-Han is such a shrewd guy. He will be crazy about compensation.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee interrupted, “Stop worrying about me and think about Osiris for now. We should cut him off first.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll take him with me even if I die first. I’ll split his head and blow it. That will do, right? That really works, correct?</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Take this, Seong-Il.” Yeon-Hee handed out Zeus’s Thunder Spear.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “I’m Human Caliber. I rely on my fist as they are my weapons.”</p>
<p>“Then… Shall we start?”</p>
<p>I could see Yeon-Hee’s face being reflected in Seong-Il’s eyes. It was my first time seeing her face ever since I had become protected inside her, my Life Vessel, and there was a subtle bit of tension on her face.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 311</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il sped up. The two were planning to get rid of Joshua before his troops in the back joined him. Joshua had sworn allegiance to me, not to Yeon-Hee, so I wondered if Joshua’s current actions were considered a betrayal. It could be a reasonable choice for him to succeed me after my death.</p>
<p>However, going after Yeon-Hee was no different from aiming at my family. In the end he wouldn’t be able to avoid the anger of the revived emperor. If he didn’t die at the hands of Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il, then I would finish him off myself!</p>
<p>The strange thing was that Joshua and his attackers didn’t slow down even though he had figured out that Yeon-Hee was approaching him with a Location Seeker.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said while running as if she was in doubt, “Isn’t it weird?”</p>
<p>“Can you not sense anything?” Seong-Il asked in return.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “It’s too far. Let’s wait and see. It’s too early to judge anything.”</p>
<p>When the distance between the two groups narrowed, Yeon-Hee sensed someone using telepathy.</p>
<p>A sepulchral voice connected to her mind.</p>
<p>- Mary.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee replied brightly.</p>
<p>- Hey!</p>
<p>Joshua asked.</p>
<p>- Do you think it’s possible?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee then said.</p>
<p>- What? Oh… You must be suspicious of your ability since you saw me, right? But it’s impossible. You are far inferior to me.</p>
<p>Joshua huffed gloomily</p>
<p>- How rude. I’m asking if you could get through the ones coming from the central area.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee responded confidently.</p>
<p>- Of course. You guys are all pieces of cake to me.</p>
<p>Joshua suddenly asked.</p>
<p>- Is it Kwon Seong-Il next to you?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said sweetly.</p>
<p>- Yeah, he is getting ready to break your head.</p>
<p>Joshua responded.</p>
<p>- Looks like he is alive. I’ll buy you time. My corps is out of my control.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee growled.</p>
<p>- It seems to me that you are the one who dragged them here.</p>
<p>Joshua paused before finally saying.</p>
<p>- …Get away as far as you can, Mary. We won’t see each other again as long as Odin is dead. We should take care of our own business from now on. This will be my last time showing respect to his girl.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee narrowed her eyes.</p>
<p>- So? Are you saying that you will give up the rewards?</p>
<p>Joshua replied.</p>
<p>- I’m not going to take it even though the System offers them.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee chided him.</p>
<p>- Joshua, Joshua. You are completely mistaken, aren’t you? Don’t you know I hold everyone’s lives in my hands, not just yours? You of all people should know about how far I can go than anyone else. Well, fine. So what is your plan? What if I didn’t show up in front of you? Were you going to hide and protect me?</p>
<p>Joshua responded mildly.</p>
<p>- Since you are his girl, I will protect you until the last day. He seems to have loved you with all his heart.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee snorted.</p>
<p>- I didn’t know you could say something sweet like that.</p>
<p>Joshua interrupted.</p>
<p>- The important thing is after that, Mary. It’s time for you to choose.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee asked, somewhat confused.</p>
<p>- Choose what?</p>
<p>Joshua clarified.</p>
<p>- Someone has to retrieve his great legacy. Jonathan is not the one. He should die here.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee quipped.</p>
<p>- Ah, too bad, so sad. What you think is going to happen won’t happen because Odin will be resurrected. You won’t believe it, but just keep that in mind.</p>
<p>- Keuk, keuk.</p>
<p>His short laugh meant that he thought her claim was ridiculous.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee answered.</p>
<p>- I knew you would react like that.</p>
<p>Joshua stopped laughing and asked.</p>
<p>- So, what are you going to do?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee mused.</p>
<p>- Odin must have so many legacies.</p>
<p>Joshua scoffed.</p>
<p>- The rewards of the assassination quest are rubbish.</p>
<p>They had gotten to the point where they could see each other’s faces without increasing their Sense. Seong-Il was ready, and Yeon-Hee’s pet also looked like it would explode into its real shape at any moment and jump into Joshua’s squad.</p>
<p>At that time, Joshua’s feelings must have been delivered to Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>- Odin must be very proud, but I know that it only takes a second for someone to change their mind. You should show your loyalty to him with your actions.</p>
<p>- I haven’t heard an answer yet.</p>
<p>- The suggestion is not even worth thinking about it. I told you what you think won’t happen.</p>
<p>Joshua insisted.</p>
<p>- He is dead.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee shook her head.</p>
<p>- No, he is inside me. So, tell your corps the truth too. You don’t seem to be sociable at all, but you can’t shout at them, right?</p>
<p>- …</p>
<p>- Join the central area as soon as you roughly sort things out. Yes, this is a request from Odin’s girl.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Joshua and his immediate attack squad turned around, and he didn’t say anything to his corps. Without telling anyone that I would be resurrected in the future, he and his corps jumped into thousands of Awakened, accompanied by a large number of summoners that had appeared after Joshua used his main skill, ‘Osiris’s Domain.’</p>
<p>“We were lucky. The most tricky guy is on our side now,” Yeon-Hee said as she ran.</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his head. “This will only make me a bad guy. I thought Osiris would be the first one to betray. But is that true that he didn't?”</p>
<p>“Did you hear us earlier?” she asked.</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yeah, a little bit.”</p>
<p>“I guess you did level up a lot in the meantime.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il remarked, “I couldn’t hear you guys well, but I heard about Odin’s resurrection for sure.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You don’t believe it either, do you?” she asked.</p>
<p>He stuttered, “D…do you have proof?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee snorted, “If I had any, things would have been quite different. I wouldn’t have been chased around either.”</p>
<p>“Are you just believing in that? Or is there a skill or insignia that made it happen? Or privileges?” Seong-Il’s face became flushed as he started to have hope.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee stated, “Let’s say that it is a privilege. Odin has become immortal.”</p>
<p>“...Fuck. Are you teasing me? Because I’m stupid?” he snapped suddenly.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee barked out a laugh. “Yes, it’s fucking nonsense, but that’s true, Seong-Il. Odin will be back.”</p>
<p>“Ah! Ah…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shuddered, then pointed at the front with his chin again.</p>
<p>“I have good news, noona. Over on that side…”</p>
<p>The two of them could still see many people pouring in towards the central region. The number of Awakened running over was a little over a thousand.</p>
<p>Seong-Il continued, “They are the residents of the Savior’s city. I don’t know about others, but they are trustworthy. Look at them. They are hard-working even when they become badly injured.”</p>
<p>“Are they the ones? The fanatics?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, noona.” Seong-Il nodded and then said, “Osiris has a plague attack team, and Odin has residents of the Savior’s city. I’m a hundred percent sure that they are coming to help you, not kill you.”</p>
<p>Although they were sometimes divided into different attack squads, it was said that their unity was indeed stronger than others. These Awakened were the ones who had gone through Act Two, Stage One with me, and they had been excluded by various groups in the Final Stage.</p>
<p>They were labeled fanatics because their beliefs toward me had gone too far. They came all the way here through the Kciphos Corps that they were in charge of dealing with.</p>
<p>Seong-Il jumped ahead, and sure enough, no ensuing battle started. As soon as they saw Seong-Il, they immediately stopped what they were doing and lowered their heads.</p>
<p>He complimented them, “Good job coming all the way here. It must have been really tough.”</p>
<p>They reported that forty percent of their original number had died during the battle against the Kciphos.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the central area, Orca’s clones were all dead just as my admirers had reported. However, Orca seemed to have been expanding its territory with all its might. A fairly large area was now all swampland.</p>
<p>Orca had become more powerful after killing Amon, which had been the mother creature who had given birth to it. Therefore, the tentacles that it made were fluttering everywhere in the swamp. The power there was comparable to the power that the Grand Duke used to hold.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee gazed up at Orca, which looked like a gigantic tree, while patting it.</p>
<p>“It’s not bad. Right? Orca is quite useful,” Yeon-Hee asked and turned her head.</p>
<p>Seong-Il was looking at the creature, then Yeon-Hee’s gaze shifted back. At this point, Orca was so strong that even Seong-Il wouldn’t be able to beat it on a one to one fight. It was watching everyone with a look as if it was sitting on a throne.</p>
<p>“It’s gotten more dangerous, but I guess it isn’t a big deal to you, right?” Seong-Il finally asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee pursed her lips. “Well… But that kid also knows that Odin will be resurrected.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head. “I don’t see how you could see something like that as a kid. You are too generous. By the way, shouldn’t you be sleeping? Osiris won’t be able to hurt the whole group. Like he said, he will just buy a bit of time for us. You should take care of yourself when you have time…”</p>
<p>[Guild: Kciphos Corps has entered the first weakening phase. The Kciphos Corps’s attack power will be significantly reduced.]</p>
<p>[Guild: Graf Clan has entered the first weakening phase. The Graf Clan’s attack power will be significantly reduced.]</p>
<p>Seong-Il sighed. “I told you, noona. There is not much time left. Although I’m stupid, it’s so obvious. Even if Lee Tae-Han and the King of Hell don’t betray you, they won’t be able to control the ones below them. There are so many Awakened in this world, and it hasn’t been that long since they were assigned to be under those two.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m saying this. Don’t you realize how much we all depended on Odin?” Yeon-Hee suddenly said.</p>
<p>Seong-Il blinked. “Excuse me?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee clarified, “Until now, we have been able to be quiet and united under that one name.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il sighed. “Anyway, I hope he revives soon. If… that’s true.”</p>
<p>When dawn broke, Joshua joined them. I couldn’t see more than one of his three immediate attack squads. After putting together everything along with what Joshua just reported from under his hood, it seemed that it would take quite a while for the others to break through the plague-infested lands that Joshua and his people had spread in the area.</p>
<p>Joshua looked to be calculating what he could do within Orca’s realm, just as what Yeon-Hee did when she first entered here. Then, Yeon-Hee said, “It’s up to that kid’s ability, not us.”</p>
<p>Joshua turned his head toward Orca.</p>
<p>He then said, “But that’s a monster.”</p>
<p>She shrugged. “And it’s the master of this realm. What are you going to do? Are you still thinking the same way?”</p>
<p>Joshua paused before finally saying, “...You are quite twisted, too.”</p>
<p>“Let me be clear. I have no intention of dying here with you guys. If things don’t work out, then I’m going to get out of here. That will be incredibly easy for me. You know that, right? But if you fight with all your might, I will never forget it.”</p>
<p>“Gosh, noona.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il walked out from behind Yeon-Hee’s back.</p>
<p>“Osiris seems to have made up his mind, so stop bothering him. He is on our side now.”</p>
<p>Joshua quipped, “Ah, you must have improved your English skills instead of just leveling up.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il rolled his eyes. “There is a thing called ‘feeling.’ By the way, things are getting unusual outside.”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s about time for them to show up. Where are they coming from?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il replied, “From the King of Hell.”</p>
<p>“How many?”</p>
<p>“There are so many that I can’t even count. Approximately thirty thousand?”</p>
<p>“Is Jonathan there?”</p>
<p>“The King of Hell doesn’t seem to be coming. I overheard the conversation between them.”</p>
<p>“So, it’s not just based on your Sense.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head. “No, noona. The King of Hell is fighting against the monster corps. Anyway, so many are coming from that side. I’m certain that they are not coming to help. I can hear them saying the word ‘kill.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said to Joshua, “There will be more than one hundred thousand people, including those coming from your corps, right?”</p>
<p>“What about those from your corps?” Joshua asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled grimly. “They are busy getting beaten up by Lee Soo-Ah. There are only two scenarios for that. Either the Light Pillar will get destroyed or they will turn toward here to kill me. Well, the other possibility is to fight to the end there and go to hell.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee continued, “Anyway, Lee Tae-Han is different from those who carried out things recklessly. You and my guys went crazy for the rewards no matter how much they feared us before. If he makes up his mind, then he will gather up everyone and come here because he didn’t reign with fear. On the flip side, if Lee Tae-Han doesn’t betray us, then he will tie up his corps as much as possible.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee added, “But I don’t know if this stage will be ruined before then or not.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Multiple groups surrounding the four sides of the Orca’s territory entered in flocks. They were prepared as if they were targeting a high-class dungeon. Yeon-Hee and her party fought every day, and I was afraid that her impatience would break the Life Vessel that I was in.</p>
<p>Anyway…</p>
<p>[Guild: The Baclan Corps has destroyed the Mary Corps’s Light Pillar.]</p>
<p>[Guild: The negative effects of the Baclan Corps (First weakening) have disappeared.]</p>
<p>Jonathan was in charge of the Baclan Corps, which Mary’s Corps had left unattended. That was the result of combining all the messages. He didn’t disappoint me. Instead of running to Yeon-Hee, he was continuing to fight against the monster corps with only the troops that had stayed.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the ones who had escaped from the Lee Tae-Han’s Corps began to enter the latest as Yeon-Hee had expected. They came over a span of many days, and there were days when they delivered sad news.</p>
<p>Apparently, Lee Tae-Han had been attacked by his executives and went missing. When we got that news, I was at my last stage before resurrection. My perseverance had finally paid off, and I no longer had to sit inside Yeon-hee and do nothing.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Revival): 0 days 0 hours 0 minutes 1 second]</p>
<p>Tik tok.</p>
<p>[You have succeeded in reviving.]</p>
<p>[You received a command from your master, Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 312</p>
<p>[Secure Human Corps (Command)</p>
<p>There is a skilled army in front of you. Let them realize who their real master is. The Old One’s followers shouldn’t be left behind. Keep in mind that the fate of the human corps is in the hands of Doom Man.</p>
<p>If you succeed: The order to attack your mainland, which was under the jurisdiction of Doom Caso, will be suspended.</p>
<p>If you fail: As planned, your mainland and the human corps will be sacrificed to the almighty Doom Kaos and those under its command, Doom Arukuda and Doom Entegasto. Therefore, you will need to find and train new corps in different dimensions.]</p>
<p>This was the reason why I had modified the spontaneous System as much as possible. This was why I had repeatedly emphasized to everyone to not consider the System as a person. The System was just a system. It wasn’t supposed to be treated by names such as God or the Old One as it had brought destruction to us in the past.</p>
<p>It was hard to find the System’s followers now, so it was easy to carry out my command. The long-cherished work had been stipulated and guaranteed.</p>
<p>Yes!</p>
<p>A second command arrived shortly afterward.</p>
<p>[Remove the Guide Lumah-le (Command)</p>
<p>An attempt to regain your power that had been granted from the Old One has been detected. In order to completely block this, the Guide Lumah-le must be destroyed. Also, this will be the first step on your journey to secure the Doom Man’s innate power.</p>
<p>If you succeed: The Old One will give up on your mainland and flee. You will secure the common power ‘Gate Creation.’</p>
<p>If you fail: The human corps will be at stake depending on the Old One’s will.]</p>
<p>[Command in progress</p>
<p>1. Secure Human Corps.</p>
<p>2. Remove the Guide Lumah-le.]</p>
<p>Those were the only two commands I received.</p>
<p>[Please select the location of your revival.</p>
<p>1. Where you died</p>
<p>2. Near your Life Vessel</p>
<p>3. Recommended spot]</p>
<p>Near my Life Vessel!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A stench that I hadn’t smelled for a long time hit my nose. To normal people, it would be just the smell of sweat and blood, but it was a scent that made me realize that I was alive.</p>
<p>“Status window.”</p>
<p>[Name: Incarnation Na Seon-Hu</p>
<p>Level: 600 (Ender) * Second Round]</p>
<p>Incarnation?</p>
<p>For now, nothing had changed from the past other than the fact that the section name that used to be ‘Challenger’ was now ‘Ender,’ which meant the man who reached the end. There was also a message that told me to distribute my stats. My inventory was empty, but it was available for me to use.</p>
<p>Even the Old One was unable to recover the power that it already granted to me before and ignore the system that had been already established. There was an order that must be kept even for those who seemed to be able to do anything.</p>
<p>Anyway, right when my eyes were fixed on the term ‘incarnation,’ something happened.</p>
<p>Incarnation? Incarnation! Incarnation…</p>
<p>“...!”</p>
<p>It felt like an ice pick was piercing my skull, and the pain radiated all over my head. I didn’t miss this suffering at all. The pain spread quickly in a few seconds and throbbed, reminding me of the time of my death. It wasn’t because of the physical pain. Instead, it was because it felt similar to the shock I received during the battle against Doom Dejire.</p>
<p>When I felt an intolerable pressure on my mentality, I suddenly remembered the moment I was attacked by Doom Dejire’s ‘Mental Separation,’ which had activated my Man who Overcomes Adversity. Within seconds, the ache became a pain, and pain became fear. It was obvious that Doom Kaos’ eyes were watching me.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaah…”</p>
<p>[Would you like to use the common power ‘Main Body Descent?’]</p>
<p>I only had one thought at the moment.</p>
<p>“Ah… No. Nooooo!”</p>
<p>No, not the main body!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I struggled in the marsh without realizing it. When I came back to my senses, I swept a hand down my face and a handful of mud fell off. Mud came out from my nostrils when I blew my nose and more came out from my ears when I scratched.</p>
<p>I understood now why I had wailed in agony when Doom Dejire had pulled me out of my body. Just briefly experiencing Doom Kaos's power had left me feeling mentally disoriented, so the pain that followed as it consumed my entire body was unbearable and indescribable.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just painful. I simply didn’t exist anymore. Neither Na Seon-Hu, nor Odin, nor Ethan were present. All disappeared, except Doom Man, who was a faithful slave of Doom Kaos. I was certain that this would happen.</p>
<p>Right then, a crowd of people ran toward me after hearing my scream.</p>
<p>[The opponent has failed to see through you.]</p>
<p>[The opponent has failed to see through you.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[The opponent has failed to see through you.]</p>
<p>There were fifteen who tried to see through me out of nowhere. It was clear that the Maruka’s plague had spread among the group, as small tentacles were seen wriggling in their wounds.</p>
<p>Defeat was written on their faces. These soldiers tried to surround me, but soon formed a defense formation. Then, they became busy exchanging glances after they saw me in my naked state.</p>
<p>One of them stepped forward quickly.</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. I thought you were the enemy… We will escort you outside.”</p>
<p>He was calculating how many benefits he would get from me as I seemed to be on a higher level than him. They were desperate for my help. Their protective barriers had been exhausted a while ago, and they didn’t have any insignias inside their torn and destroyed breastplates.</p>
<p>The leader of them was quite impatient for my answer, so he went on straight ahead. He squeezed out a voice in an attempt to convince me that they were still strong and robust.</p>
<p>“There must be insignia warehouses in that direction. If we reach there, then there won’t be any problem joining the main camp,” he said while pointing at the back.</p>
<p>He was basically asking me to take them there.</p>
<p>“Haha,” I laughed.</p>
<p>He continued, “We are squad members of the Lord of Heaven. We shouldn’t delay more time. Do you need help?”</p>
<p>The Lord of Heaven… That was what people called Zhang Weilong, one of the owners of the five seats in the semicircle.</p>
<p>A few days had already passed since Yeon-Hee had killed him, but they clearly had no idea that had happened. In the meantime, they must have wandered around Orca’s territory.</p>
<p>Their group had started in the thousands, but there were only fifteen now. Seeing that their limbs were intact, it looked like they had abandoned the seriously injured fellows. I could hear the groans from the distance when I increased my Sense a bit.</p>
<p>I got up, and their eyes naturally turned to my chest. However, I also didn’t have any insignias as I had been born anew after I died.</p>
<p>It was time to subdue them and join Yeon-Hee. Things happened behind them.</p>
<p>Whoosh-</p>
<p>Thick tentacles soared vertically as if they were blocking their retreat. They had risen to the point where I had to tilt my head back to see the end of them. Every time they wriggled, muddy water poured down like a shower.</p>
<p>The Awakened reacted quickly, but tentacles were soaring everywhere. More tentacles grew faster than the speed at which they threw themselves in all directions. Several bodies split into two and fell in front of me. A guy who had been penetrated and stuck at the end of the tentacle was floating in the air.</p>
<p>The previous group of fifteen now numbered nine, and they gathered around me. Then, they looked at me earnestly with a little hope. However, it wasn’t my name that popped out of their mouths.</p>
<p>“O…”</p>
<p>“O… Orca!”</p>
<p>Orca appeared like an incarnation of evil, but it didn’t walk out. It slowly climbed out of the water, and its two eyes glistened within its mud-covered, hideous face. The tentacles in its jawline contained more dignity and fear than before.</p>
<p>The group of people definitely had a hunch that they wouldn’t get out alive at that moment. I could feel their despair. The sticky and dark energy was already singing the funeral march.</p>
<p>The leader bumped into me while backing up.</p>
<p>“Uh… what are you going to do? Give us orders! Fuck! Orders!” he screamed.</p>
<p>He meant to fight with them instead of having them just stare at him stupidly.</p>
<p>When Orca narrowed the distance toward me, their tremors went out of control.</p>
<p>Orca stood in front of me, and the others scrambled to the opposite side. They looked at me and Orca at the same time and became confused. It seemed unbearable to them that nothing was happening. A groan came out of their mouths as if they were suffering from terrible pain.</p>
<p>“Aaaah…”</p>
<p>I pointed at them with my chin to Orca. “Overpower them, but don’t kill them.”</p>
<p>I wanted to slash all of their throats as they had gathered to kill Yeon-Hee, but I had to suppress my anger. I had to keep the killing to a minimum.</p>
<p>There was a contract I had signed in exchange for the safety of mankind. It wasn’t just the command to ‘Secure Human Corps.’ Doom Kaos would also instruct me to do whatever he had made the other Dooms that were under his control do before.</p>
<p>It was a lamentable fact that it needed an army to invade other dimensions. Therefore, people like these guys were supposed to die there. They wouldn’t realize, but it would be a meaningful death as it would guarantee… the safety of humanity…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The scenery reminded me of the Final Stage of the past. Even at that time, limbs had also protruded above the surface of the wetland like weeds. Also, the battles never stopped here which was similar to that time as well.</p>
<p>Those who were targeting Yeon-Hee were willing to take any risk as the time limit was almost over. Yes, the time limit had ended now, and the quest would have been removed as no one had succeeded. However, those in the area continued to fight. I picked up the abandoned defensive tools around me.</p>
<p>The area where Yeon-Hee was in charge of was the busiest place. The last scene I saw before the revival phase began was when Yeon-Hee was being confronted by the attack squad made up of only Awakened with mental attributes.</p>
<p>They had now changed as if they were fanatics who served the god of slaughter. The scene was chaotic, as the eyes of those present were filled with madness, their mouths were overflowing with blood, and their creepy laughs made chills run down the spines of everyone around them.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was standing at the end of one tentacle and looking down at the sight of the other Awakened killing each other. She had a hand on her forehead to press down on a throbbing nerve.</p>
<p>I stood in front of her on the same tentacle, and Yeon-Hee looked up at me just by moving her eyes and not changing her expression. Her eyes were red, but it was not because of Night Eye. Countless blood vessels in her eye were standing out such that her entire eyeballs looked so bloodshot as if they had been encroached by swarms of parasites.</p>
<p>However, Yeon-Hee began to rub her forehead instead of her eyes as if she was trying to stop something from jumping out of there.</p>
<p>“...Doom Man’s incarnation has entered. Did you know about that?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>I responded, “The outside is safe now. Your family, my family, and the entire human race.”</p>
<p>“... It’s not the price of your sacrifice, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it is.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee closed her eyes tightly. I hugged her face and then pulled her toward my chest.</p>
<p>“I’m the Doom Man. I will take care of the rest, so get some rest.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 313</p>
<p>It was pouring rain and the wetlands were even muddier. Seong-Il was given another nickname, ‘Crazy Warrior Caliber,’ as he had been fighting all over the ground. Similar to how the Awakened referred to named monsters, they also began to call him in the same way.</p>
<p>Seong-Il indeed looked like a monster when he ran around in the mud. He held one Awakened from the opposing corps in each hand and replaced them with others when his weapon died. His two eyes were moving like machines, scanning for his next prey.</p>
<p>He laughed brutally when he discovered a group fleeing.</p>
<p>“You guys must have thought we were easy pickings, but you will never be able to leave here on your own accord! Don’t let any of them stay alive! Kill them!”</p>
<p>The residents of the Savior’s City scattered and began the pursuit. Everyone was injured, but it was time they seized the chance to victory. He was putting all his energy in his two feet to chase the defeated soldiers.</p>
<p>I approached Seong-Il from his back, and he turned his head sharply. His eyes were filled with destructive strength, and a fierce wind pressure blew my hair as Seong-Il swung his makeshift weapon[1]. However, I grabbed the human head with one hand. When one of his weapons became useless, the Crazy Warrior Caliber’s lips began to shake.</p>
<p>“O… Odin…”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Thanks for helping Mary.”</p>
<p>“Of course… Did you actually rise from the dead? You have both arms and legs, right?” he asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il dropped his head while standing straight. At that time, I saw his other weapon staring at me with half-closed eyes. He couldn’t repress his astonishment as if he had seen my face up close before. He moved his lips silently, clearly stating that this didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Seong-Il burst into gleeful laughter. “Hehehe. What are you guys going to do now? You all are really dead now.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il violently threw him to the ground and stomped on his head with all his might. This was after he had already discarded his other broken weapon. He then dusted his hands off and carefully examined my entire body closely. His gaze had been fixed on the golden armor, and then shifted to my Thunder Spear and Sun Cape.</p>
<p>“I couldn’t find anything else,” he said regretfully.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “It’s okay since you got the important ones. I won’t forget what you did.”</p>
<p>He grimaced. “I really did nothing. Go see Mary. She must be having a hard time. Leave this to me.”</p>
<p>“Where do you think I got this from?”</p>
<p>I faintly smiled, and Seong-Il also smiled when he looked at my golden armor again. He had clearly relaxed a bit after seeing me. He lost his balance at the moment and stumbled.</p>
<p>Seong-Il said toward my back while putting his feet in the marsh, “What the fuck are you doing? Greet him politely.”</p>
<p>Those who were chasing the defeated soldiers under Seong-Il’s order had left already, but those who had joined late from the rear were frozen in shock.</p>
<p>As I turned my head, I saw my admirers closely. The heat from their breath, which I had witnessed through Yeon-Hee’s eyes, and the smell of blood accompanied by groans filled the air. There were only three hundred left out of one thousand people.</p>
<p>“You have all helped me a lot. Thank you, my people,” I said.</p>
<p>They began sobbing. Tears flowed from their faces like a flood. Although the rain was pouring down as if there was a hole in the sky, it was obvious that they were crying.</p>
<p>I took Seong-Il to a more private space. Since the conversation was secret and something that my admirers weren’t supposed to hear, we talked through telepathy.</p>
<p>I candidly stated.</p>
<p>- You must have seen a message that Doom Man entered the stage, correct?</p>
<p>He blinked.</p>
<p>- …Are you going to fight that again? You should take me this time. Don’t you realize how tenaciously I cling to life? I’m still alive! Even if I die, I’ll do that outside of your sight, so please…</p>
<p>I interrupted.</p>
<p>- That will never happen because I’m the Doom Man.</p>
<p>- Fuck..?</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>- You can hate me, but this is the best way for us to secure humanity’s safety outside. Yes, I made an agreement with Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>He tilted his head to the side.</p>
<p>- Umm… Nothing seems to have changed. You should at least have horns on your head.</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>- I will maybe have those sooner or later. Who knows.</p>
<p>He scratched the back of his head.</p>
<p>- Huh? What the hell… But are you sure the outside is safe now? I’m a bit confused because Doom Kaos is the boss of other monsters, right? So if you are the Doom Man… monsters are now on our side?</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>- Yes.</p>
<p>- Uh… Umm… Mmm… I think that’s better than relying on those ungrateful ones.</p>
<p>I asked.</p>
<p>- Don’t you hate me?</p>
<p>He replied.</p>
<p>- I think you forgot, but I was there, too. The ox-head’s mainland. I saw the eye and felt the same thing.</p>
<p>The light of joy on Seong-Il’s face immediately disappeared, probably because he had remembered that moment.</p>
<p>- You told me the owner of that fucking eye was the second strongest, not the first.</p>
<p>I prompted.</p>
<p>- Doom Arukuda.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>- Yes, that one. The earth will be ruined if even that one alone comes and attacks. I know you didn’t want to make a deal with the strongest one. If people find out the truth, then they could only admit that you have saved us again. Thank you. I’ll break the heads of those who have run wild without knowing it.</p>
<p>- …</p>
<p>Seong-Il continued.</p>
<p>- By the way, things have been messy while you were away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just as Yeon-Hee was referred to as ‘Mary, the Bitch’ and Seong-Il as ‘Crazy Warrior Caliber,’ Osiris was known as ‘Plague Monster.’ Joshua and his squad members were slightly outside of Orca’s territory. They had all initially seemed to have joined the realm of Orca, but after twenty days, they broke away from the plan and left.</p>
<p>They used the excuse that they would cut off the enemy's reinforcements and supplies, and block the retreat of those who had already joined the opposition. This was the first time that Mary and Seong-Il were able to assess Osiris’s military situation.</p>
<p>Their zone was a forbidden territory that no one should step in. It was impossible to enter if you only had an average number of Plague Resistance. From the moment someone stepped on the plague-stricken land, the infestation would gradually engulf their body, and they would eventually die in a hideous manner. Not only their skin and muscles, but also their bones would melt away.</p>
<p>Yes, that was right. It was an impregnable fortress. Joshua and his squad had been moving like a separate detached force there. Even when I arrived there, only a few injured soldiers remained on the spot except for Joshua.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>They stared at me silently, then they didn’t say much after standing up slowly. Upon my return, not only did they fail to display any signs of happiness, but their expressions also appeared to be reluctant and uncomfortable as if they had no desire to see their boss.</p>
<p>I commanded, “The war is over. Stop spreading the plague.”</p>
<p>There was no response as expected, leaving me with the feeling that I was communicating with vengeful spirits.</p>
<p>I cut across the disease-ridden land, then every camp became visible at a glance. It was the same with the monster corps that we had been invading. No matter which direction I turned my head, the camps seemed to stretch on endlessly.</p>
<p>I knew this as I had heard about them. The number of Awakened who had entered Orca’s territory was quite small. The entire Osiris and Mary Corps were there, and the others who were there were those who had run away from the King of Hell or Lee Tae-Han’s Corps.</p>
<p>They were all there as they had neglected the monsters they were in charge of. That was what led to the situation in the frontline.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see ghouls as the camps blocked my view, but I could hear their cries from a distance.</p>
<p>“Woooooh-”</p>
<p>Then, I saw a group running toward me. They were Joshua and his subordinates. There were some following behind, but they were slow.</p>
<p>He said hesitantly.</p>
<p>- Ma… Master?</p>
<p>I replied.</p>
<p>- Come in.</p>
<p>He arrived. When I looked at his face hidden by the darkness of his hood, I couldn’t help but think that perhaps he was facing an incredibly difficult battle. The cracked scabs on his face made it look as if his entire face would shatter like glass if I were to touch it.</p>
<p>I had a private conversation with Joshua after letting his people treat their injuries.</p>
<p>I started, “I was watching you. Your choice of not protecting Mary isn’t a betrayal. You’ve been on the side of my girl, who was left behind.”</p>
<p>He responded, “Then, you would know that it was because of your great legacy.”</p>
<p>Whatever his reason was, I was happy that my aides had moved under ‘my name’ after I died. I wasn’t angry at all. That was why I could endure even when I ran out of patience.</p>
<p>I continued, “That doesn’t matter because that doesn’t change what you did. Thank you. I won’t forget what you did for me.”</p>
<p>Joshua bowed his head calmly, then I continued through telepathy.</p>
<p>- Have you seen the message that Doom Man has entered the stage?</p>
<p>Joshua’s face, which was raised at the moment, was frozen. His eyes were fixed on my face.</p>
<p>- Yes, Master.</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>- The monumental work we built outside will remain unchanged.</p>
<p>He hesitated and then asked.</p>
<p>- Are you… the Doom Man?</p>
<p>I admitted.</p>
<p>- Yes.</p>
<p>- Can you cure me, then?</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>- Not yet, but I can look for a way. If it doesn’t work here, I can try in a different dimension. I will make sure to find a way, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>- Okay, then…</p>
<p>Joshua’s eyes turned to the camps in the front.</p>
<p>- I need an army to complete Doom Kaos’s orders from now on. I can’t kill everyone.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>- Yes, Master. Congratulations on becoming a great being.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The plague that Joshua had spread was being controlled, and those who had recovered joined the troop after recovery. From Yeon-Hee, who was using Orca’s tentacles as a bed, my admirers arrived one by one, including Seong-Il.</p>
<p>We were a small group compared to the monsters, but we were incomparably powerful. They would desperately come to realize it from now on because the emperor, who they had thought was dead, had returned to life. These people’s master came back alive.</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Storm) has been converted into Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Death).]</p>
<p>I put my people far back and clenched my teeth.</p>
<p>[Odin’s Absolute Warzone (Domain)</p>

<p>* The area will remain in effect until the user dies or the duration ends.</p>
<p>* All terrain within the area will be an exact copy of the user’s surroundings.</p>
<p>* All living things in the area will be moved outside the new domain.]</p>
<p>Swoosh-!</p>
<p>[Odin’s Absolute Warzone has opened.]</p>
<p>This was definitely a weapon that the Old One had provided me to fight against Dooms. However, it would now be used to absorb the corps it had trained.</p>
<p>Hmmm… Let’s think about it. Is the corps actually trained by the Old One? Who had brought them up to this point? Who was protecting them from Doom Kaos’s malice?</p>
<p>The Old One was a fool. The fact that it had blindly pushed us into battle, thinking that we would easily defeat Doom Kaos, was clear evidence.</p>
<p>It was time for everyone to realize who their real master was. They needed to know if it was that idiot or me, who was influencing them. It had nothing to do with Doom Kaos’s orders. This was a matter that should have been sorted out between the Dooms, the Old One, and me.</p>
<p>[You have entered Odin’s Absolute Warzone.]</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 314</p>
<p>A few hours ago, Chinese Li Weifeng had faced a dilemma. On top of the quest to eliminate the bitch ending abruptly upon reaching the time limit, the situation in the rear was worsening day by day.</p>
<p>[Warning: Doom Man’s incarnation has entered.]</p>
<p>Furthermore, an unsettling message had popped up. He was certainly surrounded by enemies on all sides. It had been a long time since the last time he heard from the Lord of Heaven, who had entered the Maruka’s territory.</p>
<p>Osiris was now blocking the path to Maruka’s territory with the plague, the Barba Corps in the back were too powerful to confront, and the avaricious corpses who were intransigent and impossible to reason with were sitting side by side.</p>
<p>The situation would have been better if the groups on both sides had cooperated. Li Weifeng’s corps would have joined the main force already by making a big detour to the land that was intact from the plague.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t that have saved the Lord of Heaven and streamlined the battlefield?</p>
<p>In the end, the quest was brought to naught, but the war didn’t end. He was unable to advance to the front. The ghouls were joining the Barba Corps in the back, and the greedy individuals on the sides offered no assistance.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>He wondered what had led to this situation.</p>
<p>The leader of the corps from the left, who was one of the thirty seat holders, visited him. Her name was Ding Xia, and her code name was Hanuman. Although she had the same nationality as him outside, he had never been in the same stage as her.</p>
<p>Li Weifeng shouted to her as if he had been waiting, “You are Hanuman. I really wanted to see what kind of moron you were. Even if you are blinded by rewards, how dare you leave the Barba Corps unattended!”</p>
<p>She retorted, “You simply had to deal with the easy Kciphos, so you don’t deserve to say anything. We were the ones who destroyed the altar first. It was Barba’s altar, as you said! Whatever. You still haven’t heard from the Lord of Heaven, have you? He must be quiet because he is dead.”</p>
<p>He snarled, “Shut the hell up.”</p>
<p>Ding Xia snidely responded, “Oh, should I just shut up and leave? If that’s what you want, sure.”</p>
<p>“What brought you here? Just get to the point,” he snapped.</p>
<p>She growled, “You are the one who started the fight.”</p>
<p>Li Weifeng scowled. “Well, then get the fuck off. My life will be in danger if I cooperate with an idiot.”</p>
<p>She mocked, “You must not know how things are going, tsk tsk.”</p>
<p>“Who made it this far?”</p>
<p>She smirked. “What do you mean who? It’s your Lord of Heaven. Those who didn’t listen to me died like that. Then, I’ll assume that you are out of this. Go to hell.”</p>
<p>Li Weifeng gritted his teeth, but this was his only chance to improve the situation. In terms of the overall military power, Hanuman’s force was much stronger.</p>
<p>“Are you forming a coalition? When it is too late?” Li Weifeng asked.</p>
<p>She shook her head. “Not me.”</p>
<p>“Then, who?”</p>
<p>“Hephaestus[1]. He must have thought that everyone would be wiped out if things remained unchanged.”</p>
<p>She was referring to Ian Jones, one of the five sitting in the front line.</p>
<p>He narrowed his eyes. “Which one is he prioritizing? The Barba Corps? Or that bitch’s corps? I’ll decide whether or not to join after you tell me that.”</p>
<p>Li Weifeng was about to reject the coalition suggestion when she said that Mary’s corps was the priority. The destructive power trapped in the central area was indeed powerful as there were Mary, her pet Kciphos Gundrak, the Plague Monster and his hideous subordinates, the Tentacle Demon[2], and Odin’s fanatics.</p>
<p>In addition, their area had become an impregnable fortress when they used their giant tentacles as a barrier and used wetlands as tenaille[3]. Wait, no. It actually would become a hell-like fortress. No one would be able to come back alive if they stepped into it. That was the biggest cause of this situation.</p>
<p>“The bitch’s corps.”</p>
<p>He barked out a laugh. “You guys are crazy, haha. Why is he even called Hephaestus? Is he a moron like you? You guys are idiots who don’t know what comes first. The quest is gone.”</p>
<p>Ding Xia hissed, “You’d better listen to me until the end.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No matter how much I listen to you…”</p>
<p>She interrupted, “Odin’s Sacred Vessel.”</p>
<p>“...!”</p>
<p>Ding Xia continued, “The quest is gone, but Odin’s Sacred Vessel is there.”</p>
<p>“Hmph. That’s obviously a trick. It’s funny how you were caught in that,” Li Weifeng mocked.</p>
<p>“Hohoho. Hephaestus promised that the person who gets it first is the owner. What do you think? Don’t you want to join us? Even if Hephaestus changes his mind, you, me, and our fucking friends won’t let him do as he pleases.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah…?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hephaestus was aware of how powerful the owners of the semicircle were, but thousands of Awakened were moving for one purpose. He thought there would be an opportunity, but he was wrong.</p>
<p>The bitch and the Plague Monster had digested the incoming prey with their mouths wide open. Ian Jones deeply regretted his actions because he realized that should have listened to Deborah Belluci and stayed still under the King of Hell.</p>
<p>Instead of cutting the bitch’s throat, all his aides were killed. If he were out of patience, then he would have been stuck in the wetland with them.</p>
<p>Hephaestus fixed his eyes at the window as a quest message appeared. As Mary’s assassination quest came to an end and a message stating that Doom Man’s incarnation entered the stage, the Guide appeared before him. The Guide, which only showed up to the rulers of the stage.</p>
<p>[Great Minds Think Alike with the Guide (Quest)</p>
<p>Lumah-le is the only Guide who made it through the fierce competition that involved 450,000 Guides. You can’t imagine how much power Lumah-le holds.</p>
<p>Mission: Protect Lumah-le from the Doom Man.</p>
<p>Class: S</p>
<p>Rewards: Challenger box * 50, start item of the quest ‘Guardian,’ start item of the quest ‘The Owner of the Skeletal Dragon,’ Privilege ‘Fast Growth.’ Privilege ‘Collection.’</p>
<p>* A great number of XP will be given if you complete the quest.]</p>
<p>It was similar to the reward for Mary’s assassination quest, but it would eventually take one’s own life.</p>
<p>Doom Man… Doom?</p>
<p>Even the Great Odin died while dealing with a Doom.</p>
<p>The Doom is coming to me… Damn it. Fuck… Why me…</p>
<p>However, he didn’t cancel it as he couldn’t stop thinking about the rewards. At that moment, a message popped up that pushed the huge quest window to one side. The Guide made an abrupt appearance in Hephaestus’s view.</p>
<p>[What are you worrying about? Most of the Awakened are on your side.]</p>
<p>“But it’s Doom,” he protested.</p>
<p>[I have already taught you that this is the opportunity to make the Doom Man reveal his main body. Use any means to make him come out to the world.]</p>
<p>“What kind of being is the incarnation?”</p>
<p>[He is strong.]</p>
<p>“Like how much?” he asked.</p>
<p>[If you successfully gather all the Awakened, it’s worth a try. There is a possibility, so get over your fear.]</p>
<p>Hephaestus was skeptical of the feasibility of merging thousands of groups with varying sizes and policies into one. Although he had used Odin’s Sacred Vessel as bait, he knew they wouldn’t be able to achieve what they wanted within a few days.</p>
<p>Honestly, it was impossible no matter how much time was allowed, unless he was Odin. Even if all the Awakened were eliminated by the war of destruction that Doom Man would bring, it was uncertain if their goal would be accomplished.</p>
<p>He asked the Guide, “You would want to live, right?”</p>
<p>[Yes, of course!]</p>
<p>The Guide nodded.</p>
<p>“Then, you should compensate me first. Then, I will do my best to protect you.”</p>
<p>[ (๑´╹‸╹`๑) I can’t believe someone who has reached this far is saying something like this. Have you not learned yet? You have to prove your worth in order to gain more powerful strength. This is the absolute rule of the System.]</p>
<p>He snarled, “That means that we both will all die together. I will cancel the quest. If you want to die, then go and do that alone. Fight the Doom Man by yourself. Don’t put me in there.”</p>
<p>[Fine. Go ahead and cancel. C-A-N-C-E-L.]</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>[Hehe, I knew it! I gave you all the hints beyond my authority. When Doom Man appears, the Awakened have no choice but to fight back. Step up and be their leader, corner the incarnation, and make him reveal his true self! If Doom Man cries out of pain, be sure to get rid of him. Never miss that short moment. Never.]</p>
<p>The Guide stared Hephaestus in the eye.</p>
<p>[When he completes his main body, no one can stop Doom Man. Then, good luck! I wish you the best, Hephaestus! ヾ(｡&gt;﹏</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 315</p>
<p>[Warning: You can’t leave the area.]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Odin’s Absolute Warzone): 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds]</p>
<p>“Do I just have to endure for one day? Does that mean I can complete the quest after one day?” Hephaestus asked while looking at the notification window.</p>
<p>[No way. You should make Doom Man run away or get rid of him.]</p>
<p>The Guide clung to Hephaestus’s shoulder. It even pretended to hug him with its tiny arms, as if it could never fall. Hephaestus’s heart pounded faster, and sweat poured out from all over him.</p>
<p>The first thing he did was climb the watchtower, but he couldn’t locate Doom Man. All he could see was the chaos of the Awakened. The Absolute Warzone was vast. People were bustling around in his camp and other Corps. Fortunately, the Barba Corps wasn’t present on the battlefield.</p>
<p>A voice suddenly pierced his ears, and he was in terror. It came from his camps.</p>
<p>“We are all going to die! Odin is here!”</p>
<p>The name that he couldn't ignore was constantly being mentioned. Hephaestus threw himself and landed exactly in front of him.</p>
<p>The person stuttered, “Hephaestus…? O…Odin was alive. He came to punish us.”</p>
<p>“It’s not him,” he insisted.</p>
<p>The person wailed, “You are saying that because you don’t know much about it! I was in Indra’s group during the preparation period for Act Two, Stage Two. It was the same back then. If you resist, then we all die, Hephaestus…”</p>
<p>The guy knelt on the ground, but it wasn’t toward Hephaestus. When Hephaestus noticed that it was for the dead Odin, he was thinking of hitting the man’s neck. However, he changed his mind.</p>
<p>His gaze shifted to the Guide as he said, “This place is called ‘Odin’s Absolute Warzone.’ If you are hiding anything from me, you better tell me now.”</p>
<p>[ ( ･᷄д･᷅ ) What are you talking about? You didn’t even ask.]</p>
<p>Hephaestus was aware of the many eyes that were fixed on him. Time was of the essence, and he needed to solve this matter. He climbed back up to the watchtower after avoiding making eye contact with his subordinates. He was planning to ask the Guide if Doom Man was Odin.</p>
<p>However, he noticed something from the far left where the camp of the Lord of Heaven was situated. It was a streak of lightning. It didn’t fall straight down from the dark clouds pouring rain; instead, it spread out in all directions from the center.</p>
<p>Hephaestus focused his attention on it, then he could see the real thunderbolt that was giving off countless branches of lightning. The trajectory of the sparks was visible from the distance, as if someone was using them as weapons. He soon came to his senses. Odin was the Doom Man.</p>
<p>“Guide… you motherfucker!” he hissed.</p>
<p>[Excuse me?]</p>
<p>He angrily stated, “You knew about this, right? Don’t say that you didn’t know.”</p>
<p>[It wouldn’t be wrong to prepare a battlefield based on our sacrifices. Hurry up. Doom Man will be here soon.]</p>
<p>“It’s not Doom Man. You should call him with more respect. He used to rule all the Awakened.”</p>
<p>[Odin is Doom Man’s old name.]</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Look for another guy. I’m out of this.”</p>
<p>[Huh? You said you will prove why you deserve the immense power even if the dead Odin came back to life or if Doom Kaos entered this stage. I heard that humans are very fickle, and I guess that’s true. Well, that must be why Doom Man fell for Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>“You are… a son of bitch. Get out of my head!” he shrieked.</p>
<p>[Hey, I was here from the beginning. Also, I don’t know if things will change even if you give up on the quest. Doom Man is pissed at you and the Awakened. Very much. Look at that. Can you feel his rage? Oh gosh.]</p>
<p>Hephaestus looked back to the distance, towards the thunderbolts that appeared to be moving as if they had a life of their own. From a distance it only looked like a natural disaster, but it was obvious that a great number of people were being reduced to ashes there. He had witnessed how one of the leaders who had come up to the Final Stage died.</p>
<p>[So things would have been better if you had already destroyed ~???~. You humans are the ones at fault that things have gotten to this point. If the will of the System had been carried out completely, then Doom Dejire would have died and Doom Man would never have existed. You guys have ruined the grand plan that the System had envisioned. It’s all your guys' faults! You idiot humans!]</p>
<p>Hephaestus stretched his hand out and tried to take the Guide off his shoulder. However, the spirit wasn’t a physical being that could be touched with a hand. Also, the Guide moved faster than his hand could.</p>
<p>The Guide was floating in front of his face now. Seeing its mischievous expression with its small tongue sticking out, Hephaestus had to suppress the anger that bubbled to the surface of his mind.</p>
<p>“What do those question marks mean?”</p>
<p>[I’m sick and tired of how stupid humans are. Your selfishness and greed are problematic too. But that must be your true ability, right? I’ll tolerate it this time. Hephaestus. Prove it to me if you want to know about ~???~. I’d like to see if you deserve to figure out what ~???~ is.]</p>
<p>“Asshole.”</p>
<p>[ (◔‸◔ )っ✄╰⋃╯]</p>
<p>Hephaestus’s fists trembled.</p>
<p>[It won’t just end with words next time. I will really cut your dick, hehe.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hephaestus decided not to mention the phrase ‘Doom Man.’ There was nothing much known about the Dooms, and they were unrealistic. However, the name ‘Odin’ was different. Everyone who heard that name felt the most extreme fear, and those gathered in the front were proof of that.</p>
<p>Before the incident, he needed cooperation from the leaders of other groups to break through the bitch’s corps. However, the majority of them refused to even talk to him. Even if they were favorable to having a conversation, most of them wanted to receive too much compensation.</p>
<p>All groups only had a common purpose of snapping off the bitch’s head, but that didn’t mean they were unified.</p>
<p>The rewards on Mary’s neck were indeed great, but it wasn’t enough for everyone to share. Therefore, a union was never built as people carried out the quest separately. However, those people were gathering while the corps on the left was collapsing under the orders of Hephaestus.</p>
<p>During that period, his base was more active than ever. He dismantled the wooden fence that divided the areas of different corps. They were occupied with setting up magic traps, similar to those within the boundaries of the Light Pillar.</p>
<p>Moreover, loud shouts could be heard from everywhere as thousands of people from multiple corps were terrified.</p>
<p>“Hurry up!”</p>
<p>“Move!”</p>
<p>“Get ready for the battle!”</p>
<p>Hephaestus looked at the people in front of him. He had not even attempted to engage in dialogue with some of them previously. They were leaders from each corps, and they had gathered there after realizing that Odin was coming to kill them.</p>
<p>[See? You are their true ruler, Hephaestus.]</p>
<p>Hephaestus ignored the Guide’s words and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows what Odin is like. He is powerful and ruthless. He will never forgive us. Even if you miraculously succeed in seeking Odin’s mercy, the bitch and the Plague Monster will never leave us alone…”</p>
<p>Then, he closed his mouth because the blue lights, which had been flashing steadily there, suddenly died out from afar. Those who were managing the battle lines and installing magic traps also stopped. They also directed their gaze towards the far-off area where only shadows remained.</p>
<p>Since there were more than one hundred thousand people crowded there, the silence felt like magic had descended.</p>
<p>A group of people emerged from the heavy rain. They were initially mistaken for Odin and his group, causing the people there to begin shrieking.</p>
<p>Boom! Boom!</p>
<p>Then, rock traps shot up from the ground and explosions occurred. The magical traps set by the camp were triggered. However, those rushing in from the left didn’t stop running. They paid no attention to stepping on the bodies of their deceased comrades and continued to scream.</p>
<p>“Odin is coming!”</p>
<p>Although there were more traps in their direction, they continued sprinting as if they didn’t matter. They were obviously being chased by a more frightening monster than the traps ahead.</p>
<p>Hephaestus threw himself forward and grabbed a man. Of course, he kept watch on the direction from which they came from, but he was unable to spot Odin. The heavy rain was still making it difficult to see.</p>
<p>“Odin? What about Odin?” he asked urgently.</p>
<p>The name triggered something from the guy. He looked back at Hephaestus with stiffened eyes to confirm that nothing was following him. The man breathed heavily and barely managed to speak while clutching Hephaestus’s body with trembling hands.</p>
<p>“You… you should run away.”</p>
<p>He interjected, “Calm down. I’m Hephaestus. Tell me what you saw.”</p>
<p>The man shook his head. “I don’t know. We… We just… fled right here.”</p>
<p>Hephaestus scowled as he watched the people running past him. There appeared to be over ten thousand individuals fleeing. The groups on the left needed to buy as much time as possible. However, the fact that ten thousand people had fled without taking any action meant that Hephaestus had little time left before encountering Odin.</p>
<p>He snarled, “Idiots.”</p>
<p>He returned to the spot where leaders were gathered. Even then, the rain was still pouring heavily. However, it had turned into a storm, accompanied by a strong scent of blood.</p>
<p>Hephaestus and the group leaders shuddered at the creepiness. This meant that there had been countless deaths on the left side. Considering the number of people who had been there, over fifty thousand would have died. Although he couldn’t calculate it accurately, it was a lot!</p>
<p>He cried in a hurry, “What should I do if I die either way? Should I sit still and stick my neck out for him?”</p>
<p>[Yes, that’s right, Hephaestus.]</p>
<p>“No, Odin is also human. Given that things have become so quiet, Odin might have also gotten killed. Even if he is alive, he wouldn’t have avoided getting injured. Look. All of us were able to gather while the corps on the left side sacrificed themselves. We are united, and things are different from them.”</p>
<p>“...Are you sure there is only Odin?” someone asked.</p>
<p>The guy wasn’t only referring to the Plague Monster, the Bitch, and the fanatics. He was also questioning whether the Tentacle Demon Orca and the King of Kciphos Gundrak were coming too. It would be terrible if Odin and all of them came together.</p>
<p>Hephaestus answered immediately, “It’s just Odin.”</p>
<p>It had not been confirmed whether Odin was being accompanied by them, but he knew that those who flocked below him would leave if he told them the truth. They would find their own way to survive.</p>
<p>“We survived this far as Odin did. There are thousands of us who have survived by overcoming a lot of adversity. We can definitely confront Odin!”</p>
<p>However, his speech wasn’t inspirational. The group leaders’ eyes were on those who were running away from the direction that Odin had appeared. Hephaestus suddenly remembered the phrase ‘Those who seek death shall live. Those who seek life shall die,’ but that didn’t help.</p>
<p>It was impossible to bring their attention back to him as the fugitives had ruined the atmosphere.</p>
<p>Right then, Hephaestus heard an angry voice.</p>
<p>- You made an alliance with the Guide, Hephaestus.</p>
<p>Hephaestus wanted to reply, but he realized that the owner of the voice was too far away for his telepathic abilities to reach.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 316</p>
<p>I only let Hephaestus hear my voice. The leaders I had spared previously had been sent to his corps, and they were causing trouble in their union. It was ridiculous to see them shaking in fear. I called in my people who were on standby at a distance.</p>
<p>After a while, Seong-Il scolded sternly, “Hurry up and move! Do you not understand me? Who the fuck still doesn’t understand Korean in the Final Stage?”</p>
<p>The leaders of the group, who were still alive, were being thrown into a corner. The ashes on the ground hadn’t been washed away even by heavy rain. The lightning bolts were gone now, but the leaders still saw them as a sickle of death. I could still hear their inner screams of terror as they glanced at me.</p>
<p>I looked away for a moment and lifted my head up towards the sky, trying to wipe away the ash powder that had stuck to my face.</p>
<p>More people were being brought here by my admirers, and the air was filled with groans. Many tried to hold in their moans as they thought it would hasten their deaths, but it was no use. Despite the heavy rainfall, their groans could still be heard.</p>
<p>“There were sixty-one nearby, but there are more in the distance. Should we distinguish them by their position?”</p>
<p>“The number and their strength don’t matter as they were the leaders of each group.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il giggled and turned toward the captives. His eyes glistened with murderous intent as he stared at them. Although I didn’t have a mental attribute like Yeon-Hee, I could read his mind.</p>
<p>I nodded at him and turned around. The cries of those begging for mercy were soon buried by a louder groan. The sound of moaning began to ring louder than the heavy rain.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>That was the sound of skulls breaking apart.</p>
<p>Ugh!</p>
<p>And that was the sound of their screams.</p>
<p>The rain poured heavier than ever.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Soon after, I told the same to my admirers and Joshua’s attack squad. I said they could recruit those who surrendered, but they could also kill some if they wanted to. I also told them to take away as much as they wanted from the losers. They didn’t need my permission if they found something on the burnt ground. In the end, I also mentioned that they deserved everything.</p>
<p>I walked around. When I found people with ‘offensive captain’ badges on their clothes, I killed them on the spot. It was necessary to maintain my trait Passion and to make it clear how those who dared to confront me would be dealt with.</p>
<p>Two hours later, the people who surrendered and lost their fighting spirit were now gathered in one place. I thought I had killed a lot as an example, but there were still many who were alive and crowding the area.</p>
<p>Seong-Il came over with the report, “There are over forty thousand people.”</p>
<p>At that time, Seong-Il didn’t have any killing intent toward the remaining leaders. He was also cautious as he also was now thinking, ‘What’s the point of killing more when they have surrendered?’</p>
<p>However, that only applied to Seong-Il. My admirers and Joshua’s squad members were waiting for my orders. They were still pissed and determined to avenge their colleagues’ death.</p>
<p>Their murderous intent was so obvious that surrenders couldn’t even turn their heads toward them. Therefore, thousands of capitulators had their heads lowered with their mouths clamped shut.</p>
<p>I watched the scene from a distance, then called Joshua in.</p>
<p>“Everyone wants to fight under you, Master,” he commented.</p>
<p>I snorted. “Anyone can say that. Send them first, but none of you need to be in command. Whether they join Hephaestus or join my corps, let them choose their real master.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yes, Master.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Kneel to Odin!”</p>
<p>“Kneel down-!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell who started it, but soon that shout became a chant. The surrenders flocked to Hephaestus’s camp and shouted, but none of them wanted to join them. Instead, there were many attempts to flee from his camp. The clashing of swords and the sparkling of shields could be seen and heard in that location.</p>
<p>Some of them managed to escape from Hephaestus’s camp. As the sound of people calling out to kneel before me grew louder, infighting began to escalate within Hephaestus’s camp. I made eye contact with Hephaestus, who was trying to quell the internal conflict. He finally found me on the hill overlooking the whole scene.</p>
<p>He pompously said.</p>
<p>- But you were once our leader. If you are still part human, give up and go back. That will benefit both of us! We, two hundred thousand Awakened…</p>
<p>I cut off his ridiculous telepathy. He surely believed that we were on equal footing, as he had the Guide on his shoulder. Even if there were actually two hundred thousand Awakened on his side as he had mentioned, he would soon realize how useless that number was.</p>
<p>I jumped down the hill. Those competing for whose voice was louder quickly quieted down. My Thunder Spear started emitting light with lightning power.</p>
<p>Whoaaaah-!</p>
<p>My people began to spring up with a loud roar. Only those who truly demonstrated their loyalty to me through their actions could remain in my army, instead of just professing their devotion to me with words alone.</p>
<p>Just a few hours ago, they were at the brink of being slaughtered by me, but now, they were under my command. Their faces had been filled with despair, but they now glowed with the spirit of fighters.</p>
<p>There were many reasons. They had thought I was dead, but I came back alive. Also, they could survive only if they fought under me. I saw these faces as I passed by them, and most of them were clenching their teeth.</p>
<p>I stepped on a guy’s head and jumped in the air. I found the magic traps that were hidden in the direction of my soldiers’ progress. The Thunder Spear flew straight ahead, and there were countless branches of lightning that came off of it, like twigs on old trees. They swept through the area where the magic traps were set up.</p>
<p>Then, I threw myself forward.</p>
<p>“Kneel to Odin!”</p>
<p>“Kneel to Odin!”</p>
<p>“Kneel to Odin!”</p>
<p>The shouts that had been in front of me were now behind my back. I advanced past those who were ahead of me and arrived at the entrance of Heaphaestus’s camp. My Thunder Spear, golden armor, and flames emanating from my back caught the attention of those at the gate, and none of them dared to make eye contact with me.</p>
<p>I stated, “The person in charge cannot avoid the punishment of death. However, the fate of those who surrender will be determined by the people who will come in later. It’s up to you if you want to kneel to them or not. But those who block my way won’t even have that opportunity. Yes, I am Odin!”</p>
<p>Spang!</p>
<p>I thrust my Thunder Spear upward in the air, causing thick stalks of powerful lightning, which could be mistaken for Indra’s Sword, to appear. They then spread out numerous branches of lightning in all directions.</p>
<p>More specifically, the lightning bolt had struck directly at the spot where I knew where Hephaestus was. The lightning energy still remained on the ground that the bolts had passed by. With each step I took, the lightning surged like a flame, illuminating the area around me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The owners of the thirty seats and executives of the corps were not much different from the leaders. They often retreated after forcing their subordinates to fight on the front lines.</p>
<p>Two hundred thousand Awakened? Even if the number was real, it would require a strong conviction to kill me with them. They needed a determination that wouldn’t break like the Declan Corps. Basically, all two hundred thousand people were supposed to be willing to die and dedicate everything they had, under the belief that even the last one would fight to the death.</p>
<p>I put effort into training everyone. I made it possible for them to maximize their basic ability by letting them grow as much as they could freely. They were superior to the Awakened in the past around this time.</p>
<p>However, no one could touch me. I was the only one on the path of lightning that I built. All they did was look at me with stupefied faces as I passed right in front of them. The shouts to attack me came from afar as their superiors were hiding behind the human wall. They ended up being torn by my angry thunderbolts.</p>
<p>A fierce battle was now starting at the gate of Hephaestus’s camp. I could understand how Yeon-Hee would have felt, being treated as someone who existed but was invisible. I could only see Heaphaestus crawling on the ground at the end of the road. He had lost his nerve after one lightning strike.</p>
<p>The Guide seemed more anxious as it flapped its wings uneasily. Then, it flew away after seeing me. It soared into the air, so now I had something to chase after it.</p>
<p>I swung the Thunder Spear. It had the ability to strengthen lightning power, and Odin’s Wrath was also inside the weapon. The spear was wrapped in extreme force, referred to as the ‘Ender.’</p>
<p>I aimed the tip of the spear toward the Guide and swung it in a trajectory of a full moon. The lightning bolts that shot out from the spear scattered in all directions as if laughing at the uncontrollable power it held. They formed the wings I had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>The lightning power that was clumped like a full moon frantically flew toward the Guide, but the Guide pulled its body out just before the spear thrust into it. Then, it hid in the air, just as the Grafs and Orca hid in the ground. I couldn’t tear apart time and space, but I could capture the movement.</p>
<p>That was when I started spraying lightning bolts into the air where it would appear.</p>
<p>Spang, spang, spang!</p>
<p>I stabbed the spear toward the spot briefly and quickly. The sparks of lightning stems that were vomited in the sky created colorful lines. The reason why I was mad at that moment wasn’t only because the Guide was avoiding them shrewdly. It was because of its mischievous attitude. Whenever it hid in the air to avoid lightning power…</p>
<p>[ (◔‸◔ )っ✄╰⋃╯]</p>
<p>Whenever it poked its head out of the hole…</p>
<p>[ (◔‸◔ )っ✄╰⋃╯]</p>
<p>It was causing misery for everyone, including those who were being ripped apart by my lightning, my admirers who had fought for me, and the leaders who were running away from me to survive. It was ridiculing even my genuine intentions of humbling myself to Doom Kaos for the sake of humanity’s safety.</p>
<p>It was mocking everything with a few messages. It felt like all the times that every Awakened, including myself, had struggled fiercely for our own purposes was being denied. How little did the Old One think of us and assign this motherfucker as our Guide?</p>
<p>[ (◔‸◔ )っ✄╰⋃╯. Be careful! I’m going to really cut it off.]</p>
<p>However, the reason it was trying to piss me off was not a big deal. It, of course, knew it couldn’t get away from me.</p>
<p>A thunderbolt finally grazed its wings the moment it came out of the hole in the air. Then, a clump of thunderbolts, which it had thought would have disappeared far away, shocked it. It fell head over heels. It tried to fly in a hurry, but I had already jumped in front of it.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why don’t you say that again?” I snarled.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 317</p>
<p>Upon entering the Ender section, I gained the ability to inhibit the activation of traits. For instance, Forerunner increased Agility to the next level with the highest probability when the user exerted powerful damage on the target. However, the problem was that it was activated regardless of whether I wanted it to or not even when I was dealing with weak monsters, and its cooldown time was pretty long.</p>
<p>For this reason, I used up all of my traits except for Man who Overcomes Adversity and Passion during the battle against the Declan Corps. This left me with limited choices when facing Doom Dejire.</p>
<p>However, I no longer had to struggle as I had entered the Ender section.</p>
<p>“What are you doing? Why don’t you say that again?”</p>
<p>Right in front of its very eyes, the tip of my spear was right at the Guide’s tiny face. When the stems spread out like spider webs from the point of impact, the Guide’s protective barrier vibrated frantically and cracked.</p>
<p>A tingling sensation overwhelmed my hands, and the Guide flew off into the distance.</p>
<p>[You have significantly damaged the opponent.]</p>
<p>I activated the two traits, Forerunner and Sensitive, that I had saved for this moment. As they had a high chance of activation, they were effective immediately. This also clearly demonstrated that even the great Old One couldn’t control the System that it had created. If it was possible, then I would have failed to activate my traits despite their low failure probability.</p>
<p>Watch carefully, you stupid Old One.</p>
<p>If it was going to throw us into a petty piece of the game, then it should have at least presented a vision. Wait, no. I shouldn’t expect anything from the guy who was going to boil the hounds after the hunt was over.</p>
<p>Do you understand? That will end up ruining you, you jerk.</p>
<p>It would never beat Doom Kaos like that.</p>
<p>[Forerunner has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Sensitive has been activated.]</p>
<p>Anyway, there was an ‘Ender’ after the Challenger section. After Ender, there was the ‘Overload’ section, which meant the Awakened would become a transcendental being. It was the realm where the Awakened could defeat Doom Dejire.</p>
<p>In the past, only the First Evil had reached the Ender section, also known as SS-class in the previous system, but even he hadn’t been able to enter the transcendent section. By activating Forerunner and Sensitive, my Agility and Sense had reached a transcendent level without the help of the Man who Overcomes Adversity.</p>
<p>At that moment, I heard a voice asking me to get him out, but it wasn’t an actual voice. I felt like the trait Gifted, which was linked to the activation of other traits, was telling me to activate it as well.</p>
<p>I saw no reason to refuse as it was the perfect opportunity to seek retribution against the Guide who had mocked and made fun of me.</p>
<p>[Gifted has been activated.]</p>
<p>[The Proficiency of all traits has changed.</p>
<p>Change: LV.8 → LV. 9]</p>
<p>[Passion (Trait)</p>
<p>Effect: Reinforces the user’s offensive skills in nine levels that activate in proportion to combat time.</p>
<p>Level One. One hour from the start of the battle.</p> The rate of injury regeneration significantly increases. <p>Level Two. One hour after Level One activates.</p> The probability of trait and item activation significantly increases. <p>Level Three. One hour after Level Two activates.</p> Physical and Magic Resistance significantly increases. <p>Level Four. One hour after Level Three activates.</p> The cooldown time of a skill significantly decreases. <p>Level Five. One hour after Level Four activates.</p> Every item’s defense charging speed significantly increases. <p>Level Six. One hour after Level Five activates.</p> Resistance toward all negative effects significantly increases. <p>Level Seven. One hour after Level Six activates.</p> All effects up to Level Six are strengthened. <p>Level Eight. One hour after Level Seven activates.</p> Power Resistance[1] slightly increases. <p>Level Nine. One hour after Level Eight activates.</p> A powerful defense system that protects the body, mind, and soul has been completed. <p>Class: S</p>
<p>Proficiency: LV.9 (12.29%) - when Gifted is activated]</p>
<p>[The existing effects change due to the alteration in the Proficiency level of Passion.]</p>
<p>[Change: Significantly -&gt; Maximum extent]</p>
<p>[Remaining time until the next Level (Level Seven): 21 minutes 30 seconds]</p>
<p>[Strongman (Trait)</p>
<p>Effect: Reflects physical damage back to the attacker without any conditions.</p>
<p>Class: S</p>
<p>Proficiency: LV.9 (0.34%) - when Gifted is activated</p>
<p>Duration: 1 hour</p>
<p>Cooldown time: 24 hours]</p>
<p>It was like a machine being run by geared wheels. Once the initial trait was triggered, all other traits were activated simultaneously.</p>
<p>Sheeeeek-</p>
<p>It took just a few seconds for me to chase after the Guide that was flying away. It landed on the ground, but it still couldn’t shake me off as I threw myself back toward it. The conceited guy had bragged that it was the only one left among forty-five thousand spirits and that the entire power of the Stage of Advent was concentrated on it, but its combat abilities were laughable to me. Only its eyes were able to follow my movement.</p>
<p>Oh well, it should have confronted Doom Dejire on its own if it had the ability to enter the realm of transcendence! It flapped its wings slowly, and it was shabby.</p>
<p>I felt a crack in the time and space where the Guide had bounced off. Although it could make pockets in the air and cross into them freely, it no longer looked like it was moving at a breakneck speed to me. To be exact, I had surpassed its speed. I knew the Guide had a knack for reading thoughts from people’s minds, but it wouldn’t be able to do that faster than I could act.</p>
<p>Its body was slowly changing direction while it crouched its head, which was the size of a thumbnail, towards its chest. However, the tip of my spear stabbed it first before it finished making a defensive posture.</p>
<p>The mischievousness on its face vanished, and I landed back on the ground. The recoil made it fly away uncontrollably. In order to prevent my people from being swept into the battle, I needed to move the spot as far as possible to the boundary of the Absolute Warzone. Therefore, I let it run away as it dug a temporary pocket in the air.</p>
<p>I mocked.</p>
<p>- Yes. Go ahead and run away as far as you can go.</p>
<p>[Don’t make me angry.]</p>
<p>- I’m going to give you three seconds. Three… Two… One…</p>
<p>[Ha, you are funny. Doom Man’s three seconds go by really fast, so you better count down based on human’s time.]</p>
<p>It disappeared into the air pocket.</p>
<p>Sure, let’s see how long you can stay frivolous like that.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even if the Guide broke through time and space and escaped, traces were bound to remain. Any Awakened in the challenger section could notice small cracks.</p>
<p>The Guide attempted to wipe out its tracks, but its traces were connected to the edge of the boundary surrounding the battlefield as I had intended. It was scratching the boundary, but even during a fierce battle against Doom Dejire, the boundary didn’t break.</p>
<p>The Old One had given me this boundary, just as it had given the Guide the power to manage the Stage of Advent. It definitely wanted me to frantically fight and die with Doom Dejire. Such a nice place was ‘Odin’s Absolute Warzone.’</p>
<p>I smiled at the Guide’s anxious back. Then, I deliberately made a noise to make it listen to me. Although I couldn’t put up a stupid emoji, I could laugh as loud as I wanted and ridicule it.</p>
<p>“Hehe.”</p>
<p>[You have used Devi’s Sword.]</p>
<p>It was a sword that had eventually cut through Doom Dejire’s throat, but I didn’t need a knife that could slay a cow in order to catch a chicken. The same was true for the method of drawing trajectories. I just blew it away without drawing a huge orbit.</p>
<p>When I swung Devi’s Sword, my spine ached because the lingering memory of my death still remained in my body. The sword that brutally cut through Doom Dejire from top to bottom was now hurtling towards the Guide.</p>
<p>Sheak-</p>
<p>I made eye contact with its bewildered tiny eyes. I crossed my arms as if I was tightly hugging the Thunder Spear.</p>
<p>I sneered.</p>
<p>- You better appreciate that it’s Devi’s Sword. I don’t want to make you explode all at once.</p>
<p>The trajectory of Devi’s Sword began to be drawn when it reached the Guide. It was a three-dimensional sphere-shaped orbit that revolved around the Guide. It rolled its eyes, then dug into a pocket in the center. Thus, only Devi’s Sword was spinning along its original trajectory.</p>
<p>The blade was whirling fast, and the wind pressure derived from the orbit was intense. The Guide poked out its head, then hurriedly closed the pocket and disappeared. That was its limit. I had already figured out its ability to dig rabbit holes and calculated the sword’s trajectory based on the Guide’s emergency movement range.</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>- It’s no fun if you hide like that. I will give you three seconds. 3… 2… 1…</p>
<p>It pulled itself completely out of the hole. At that time, the blade was rotating in a curve, passing quite a distance from its face.</p>
<p>[That’s unfair! Lumah-le can’t even go outside.]</p>
<p>I suggested.</p>
<p>- It’s possible if you skip the space twice quickly.</p>
<p>[The blade is going to thrust into me as soon as I try. Do you think I’m a fool like you guys? But is this fun? Nope, this is ridiculous. You are so immature.]</p>
<p>I grinned maliciously.</p>
<p>- Well, the fun starts now.</p>
<p>I stamped the ground with the spear. The stalk of lightning that soared up and flew toward the Guide resembled a lightning dragon at first glance. The tendrils of lightning that extended along the flying trajectory formed the body and tail of the dragon, and the ones swaying up and down in front created its wide-open jaw. They flew to the prison made by the blade and surrounded it. The dragon’s jaws were tightly shut, and sparks flickered in the fierce wind.</p>
<p>Whoosh- Zing! Zing!</p>
<p>- You should have tried before this happened. Then, you might have lost just one wing. You now have to give up on your limbs.</p>
<p>[Close your mouth and eat this. (ﾉ*OωO*)ﾉ彡┻┻[2]]</p>
<p>Ah, this asshole didn’t even wish for the majestic death. I had been willing to kill it quickly without any pain, but that was before it had sent the last rude message.</p>
<p>I said cruelly.</p>
<p>- Don’t you guys like games? Think of it as a quest and try to get out of there. There is no reward, though.</p>
<p>[You are making me really mad. You have Doom Kaos’s blessing, but what about the others? If you make me angry or hurt me, none of the other Awakened can go back home. Can you handle my rage? I’m the only Guide, Lumah-le.]</p>
<p>I barked out a laugh.</p>
<p>- Is that what you should say to the man who killed Doom Dejire? That’s not helping your case at all. You’ll die here, but I’m not going to just kill you. I’m going to play around for a long time, then finally slit your throat.</p>
<p>- Go ahead. If you succeed in getting out of the trajectory, I will give you the next quest.</p>
<p>[I’m not going to do that. All I have to do is hide in here. You should go have fun by yourself, Doom Man.]</p>
<p>I sneered.</p>
<p>- Ah, you must not know yet. This is a linked quest that you cannot cancel.</p>
<p>[Doom Kaos’s guy is indeed amazing. So it doesn’t matter if humans cannot return to the mainland, right? Do you really want to start this? Hehe.]</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>- My corps members will return through the gate. It’s not the way you guys planned, but that doesn’t matter.</p>
<p>[Oh… I see. Then, the game ends here because Lumah-le is very angry.]</p>
<p>- Okay, let’s do this.</p>
<p>[Lumah-le is very mad! ٩(๑`н´๑)۶ ]</p>
<p>1. Resists someone trying to control you (using authority) ☜</p>
<p>2. The Guide is giving Seon two middle fingers. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 318</p>
<p>The Guide didn’t turn red as it had during the early days of the Stage of Advent. Therefore, it originally had such a vicious expression.</p>
<p>It vanished and reappeared, then was impaled by the lightning blade’s prison. It tried to escape from the violent trajectory and thunderbolts derived from there. The moment it completely got out of the prison, one of its blue arms was cut off. However, a golden arm replaced it instantly.</p>
<p>[Ta-da! ( 'ω' )/*҉ It’s too early to be shocked.]</p>
<p>It flew straight to me, but not at a transcendental speed. However, the strange movements around me were comparable to its pace. I soon realized that Lumah-le was attacking me. The force pressured me and made me unable to move anywhere. When I shook it off like I was lifting a mountain…</p>
<p>[That’s surprising! But it’s too late.]</p>
<p>Lumah-le’s new golden hand was rushing toward my right eye. I could avoid it if I wanted to, but I let it hit me. Instead, I smirked the same way it had done to us multiple times before. It should have stopped there if it had realized something, but it didn’t. Perhaps it was planning to dig into my eye and destroy my skull.</p>
<p>I was certain about it when I saw the Guide, which had only existed as a glaring light, being united into a clear form of a body at the moment. I didn’t even think about whether I could crush its protective barrier or whether I could break through the Ender section and gain even greater strength.</p>
<p>I stared at its wicked face. However…</p>
<p>[Strongman has been activated.]</p>
<p>The Guide bounced off, and its face burst open. The golden light shone and the blue light disappeared. Its new face was formed again in gold.</p>
<p>I quipped.</p>
<p>- Why are you hurting yourself? Stupid.</p>
<p>[You did it!]</p>
<p>It became translucent like it was in the beginning. It had realized attacking me physically was like committing suicide.</p>
<p>I suggested.</p>
<p>- Why don’t you do that again? The thing you did a little while ago. Do you have a name for the skill?</p>
<p>I asked it about the skill that had made me motionless for a moment.</p>
<p>[Do you think Lumah-le is as silly as you guys? The System is made for dumb ones. The people who can’t do anything without the System. Idiots like you guys!]</p>
<p>Its face and messages gave off different moods. The face of an evil spirit who just crawled out of hell didn’t match well with its frivolous messages. That was abominable. Even then, it was digging holes in the air and moving around without a break. Its eyes were searching for an opportunity to attack me, so I found them quite despicable.</p>
<p>[Hey, I warned you. (◔‸◔ )っ✄╰⋃╯I did say I would really cut it off.]</p>
<p>As it had said, the entire force that was pressuring me was moving down to my penis. It was the same power that had burst open numerous Awakened’s faces. I had no intention to be taken in by its disgusting pranks. It was time for the Guide to get a taste of its own medicine.</p>
<p>The pressure on my lower body was immense, but my upper body was free. I stretched out the Thunder Spear. The light from its golden face blocked my line of sight for a second, but it couldn’t stop me. As expected, the Guide was digging a hole again in the air.</p>
<p>A thunderbolt fell behind its back. The force in the weapon was equal to the power that Odin’s Thunderstorm had as it was concentrated from the spear.</p>
<p>It was a time when I was shaking off the fucking pressure on my lower body. The Guide was falling off from the hole it created in the other direction. My eyes were on the Guide.</p>
<p>[You have used Indra’s Sword.]</p>
<p>The lightning power from Indra’s Sword was thick enough to swallow dozens of spirits like that. I didn’t expect it to scream like Doom Dejire as Devi’s Sword was currently at level 9. However, it would suffer from more extreme pain as it was weaker than Doom Dejire.</p>
<p>[This is the converted form of Devi’s Sword, right? That’s unfair! Why is the cooldown time so short?]</p>
<p>That was its scream. I didn’t directly stab it with Indra’s Sword. Instead, the thick lightning bolt engulfed it like a tide. I saw its remaining arm and two legs being torn apart. Now, its golden head and torso were the only things struggling against Indra’s Sword.</p>
<p>I jumped up high. Both Indra’s Sword and Thunder Spear had unbelievably strong lightning power. When the two lightning strikes were fused, the destructive power doubled up. I was about to pierce it with the tip of the spear and toy with it, like a cat playing with a dying mouse.</p>
<p>This was being delayed a bit. The force that had held me down and almost crushed my lower body was now forming a barrier around the Guide. I was forced to land on the ground as I glared at the Guide that was escaping from Indra’s Sword.</p>
<p>However, it stumbled in the air and began to fall.</p>
<p>I smirked.</p>
<p>- This is the second quest. Quest ‘Fire Hell.’</p>
<p>[You have used the Road of the King of Hell.]</p>
<p>I sketched out where I wanted things to go first.</p>
<p>[You have used Hanuman’s Tail.]</p>
<p>Then, I snatched the Guide, which was falling, with my fiery tail.</p>
<p>The Guide sent a frivolous message again as if it was alive and well.</p>
<p>[This is unfair! It’s just an A-class item, not even S! But why is it so powerful?]</p>
<p>It, of course, knew that both skills had exceeded the general limit and had been upgraded to the god-like LV. 8. Its impish and petty tone might have been used to determine other people’s life and death before, but it looked to be a defense mechanism to me. It was a way to hide its weakness. The contorted face of an evil spirit could never hide such truth.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t kill it until I fixed its poor manners. I was clutching it by my tail, and it was struggling with painful gestures. I soaked it into the flames that soared from the ground, then pulled it close to me.</p>
<p>As it got closer to my nose, I covered it with the Cape of Flame. The Cape fluttered recklessly. After that, it barely managed to remove the cape with all its might. It was wrapped around in a burning tail, and the tiles were heated to a great extent.</p>
<p>I remarked.</p>
<p>- You are pretty good at holding up. That’s enough to say that you completed the quest.</p>
<p>[What is the next quest? I thought about it, but I think the final reward for the linked quest should be Doom Man’s life. Oh, hmm… Wait! You have the Life Vessel anyway. This quest is so unfair! It’s a scam!]</p>
<p>Golden lights flowed down its cracked face like blood. It looked like it was thinking, ‘I shouldn’t die now. There is still a long way to go.’ I decided not to toy with the combination of Thunder Spear, Odin’s Wrath, and Hera’s Lunacy. Oh, also the triple flame streak[1].</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>- The next quest is ‘Horrible Pain.’</p>
<p>[You will get in trouble one day if you use the power given by the System like that.]</p>
<p>I shrugged.</p>
<p>- I had proven myself and won the power. It wasn’t given by the Old One as I collected all the trophies lying between thorns on the way here. You are the Guide, but you don’t know a single rule. Are you an idiot?</p>
<p>It was staring at me as if it would soon burst into tears. When the golden blood poured down on its face, I saw a crack in the space above me.</p>
<p>How dare you.</p>
<p>I threw myself into the gap as I was grabbing the Guide in my hand. It was then the cracked top, which was torn from side to side, swallowed me. Pitch darkness unfolded in front of me, and it was the jaw that gulped me. Then, it vanished in a flash.</p>
<p>The Guide shook its head when it failed to attack me. The golden hue was now going down its neck and spread to its entire body.</p>
<p>I said while smiling at it.</p>
<p>- The power of death gives you the most extreme pain. You can count on it because I can guess what kind of pain it will be.</p>
<p>[Well, fine. Then, shouldn’t you let me go first? We should start the next quest.]</p>
<p>- Yes, we will.</p>
<p>[You have used Seth’s Nail.]</p>
<p>It was the grip of death that took one’s life in a blink, but the duration of the pain would feel like an eternity to the Guide. Even if it survived, the scar would continue to remain and gnaw at its life. That was why Seth’s Nail was often used for torture in the past.</p>
<p>Sseuk-!</p>
<p>Five black nails scratched the entire body of the Guide vertically from its head to its legs. I let it go when I saw a new expression on its face. Since then, it jumped across the space to avoid me. I couldn’t see its face when it bent its waist after struggling in pain. Flippant messages no longer appeared.</p>
<p>However, it came out from different holes by twisting its body and revealing its face, with its head hanging low towards me. If it could make a noise, it would have screamed ‘Aaaaaagh!’ Although the sky was blocked by the boundary of the Absolute Warzone, it seemed to have judged that moving as high as possible was the way to escape from me.</p>
<p>It started jumping through space toward the sky. I couldn’t see its face then, and I could only tell that it was struggling with the pain as it writhed in agony. I had multiple skills that would fly up on my behalf and attack him, but I felt bad after losing the Skeletal Dragon in my brutal combat against Doom Dejire.</p>
<p>When I was regretting my decision, the Guide crashed. Even then, I was already at the point where it would fall. I didn’t snatch it when it dropped before me. The ground was covered in the fire anyway, and it wouldn’t plummet deep down into the earth like a Graf.</p>
<p>It squirmed in the fire. Its wings were nowhere to be seen, and it had no more golden blood to spill. It was dying. It resembled a dragonfly that had been inadvertently toyed with by an innocent child. Its wings had been removed and thrown into the bonfire. When I met its painful eyes, a message that had stopped for a while popped up.</p>
<p>[You are going to spare my life, right? (ღゝ◡╹)ノ♡ ]</p>
<p>- What’s the magic word?</p>
<p>[...Please.]</p>
<p>I grinned.</p>
<p>- Yes, I was waiting for that.</p>
<p>I finally moved the Thunder Spear.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>The tip of the spear pierced the Guide and stabbed the ground. The wide part of the spear was capable of ripping off its head as well as its lower body. The Guide started to scatter into pieces.</p>
<p>[The command ‘Remove the Guide Lumah-le’ has been completed.]</p>
<p>There was no corpse left, but the power of the Old One inside the Guide was beginning to get revealed. It was busy giving off black energy and turning into a brilliant white light. The light started to flow through my whole body from the tip of the spear.</p>
<p>[Congratulations! You have gained the common power ‘Gate Formation.’]</p>
<p>1. Road of the King of Hell + Hanuman’s Tail + Descent of the King of Hell. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 319</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>The targeted area was the earth, but there was a notification message that followed up.</p>
<p>[The power of the Old One, who is eager to conquer your homeland, still remains in the area. But please be happy. The Old One has been spotted, and it’s beginning to flee from the region.]</p>
<p>By the time I returned to the military headquarters, Hephaestus was dead. His corpse was a mess as if he had been beaten up by a herd of angry wild dogs. Since others had taken away his items, he would have been wandering around hell naked by now. His head would be intact there. Everyone would have realized that nothing could escape from the battlefield.</p>
<p>[You have completed the command ‘Secure Human Corps.’]</p>
<p>[The order to attack your homeland, which was under the jurisdiction of Doom Caso, has been suspended. The battles here will be handled by the Lunea Clan.]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee approached me through the bustling chaos. The defeated soldiers had either scattered or surrendered, and the spoils were being collected from the bodies and ground.</p>
<p>“My quest is gone,” she reported.</p>
<p>I commanded, “Tell me in detail.”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I can’t open my quest window anymore.”</p>
<p>After asking the other Awakened, I discovered that Yeon-Hee wasn’t the only one who had this issue. As they were driven away from the areas that still had intense fighting, more and more people began staring into the air.</p>
<p>Around that time, there was a new movement starting outside the boundary. The Barba Corps had been clustered along the boundary earlier, but they were withdrawing.</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>[The power of the Old One, who is eager to conquer the homeland, still remains in the area.]</p>
<p>What bothered me the most was the fact that there were still monster corps left on the earth. Although the order to invade the earth had been rescinded, I couldn’t relax until I confirmed with my own eyes that all the monsters had gone.</p>
<p>We first gathered the defeated soldiers and searched for those who had been in charge. Then, a spirit entered the territory as soon as my Absolute Warzone duration was over. It looked no different from the others, so Yeon-Hee first mistook it for Lumah-le. Her eyes then became sharp as if she had realized something.</p>
<p>“There is no hostility coming from it. It’s actually the opposite. What do you want to do?” she finally asked.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The spirit also couldn’t speak like the previous Guides did. However, we couldn’t use the System that had disappeared, so we needed a place to communicate.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee suggested going to the place that was built in my mental world.</p>
<p>Hwak!</p>
<p>It was my grade seven classroom where I had first met Yeon-Hee. When I entered, the first thing I saw was the view from the window. Yeon-Hee was standing in front of the lecture desk, and a black-haired girl was sitting right across from Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>Then, their heads turned to me at the same time. I was looking into the classroom through the window from the hallway.</p>
<p>Both of their faces had hardened after spotting me. I could see the reflection of two huge eyes staring at them in their own eyes, which had obviously scared the two. They were my eyes, and my intense gaze had frightened them.</p>
<p>At that moment, I realized what I could do here. The ‘clenched fist in the air,’ which was the symbol of Revolucion, was now replacing the Taegeukgi[1] in the picture frame, and I was depicted as a hulking presence.</p>
<p>This was the scene that Yeon-Hee hoped to see. Yeon-Hee had made this place, but that was the extent of her abilities. This area was under my control.</p>
<p>I opened the front door and entered the room. When I got in, I wasn’t a hideous or gigantic figure anymore. My two arms and legs were intact like any ordinary guy’s.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee moved her lips silently.</p>
<p>‘Congratulations, Seon-Hu. You are ahead of me again.’</p>
<p>However, in contrast to what she just said, her expression was bitter. I had explained to her that it was no one’s fault, but she still clearly felt bad about what I had sacrificed and that I had humbled myself in front of Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>Anyway, I sat at the desk where the black-haired girl was sitting.</p>
<p>She said, “Call us Lune-ah even though our name is spelled ‘L-U-N-E-A.’ I know you are very upset with my clan, but the Guides from earlier are the ones who had fled us a long time ago. I’m not frivolous like them.”</p>
<p>Her eyes trembled as she smiled. She was forcing herself to be kind to me. Her eyes then curved up into a crescent-moon shape that was quite well made. She was trying to win my favor.</p>
<p>She continued, “There is only one reason why I came to see you. You call us monsters, right? It doesn’t matter. Please stop attacking the monster corps so that we can safely return to our home. Your corps can return without more damage.”</p>
<p>“That must be your responsibility,” I stated.</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” she asked, confused.</p>
<p>I clarified, “ I haven’t received any other commands. Yet. Until then, your fate depends on me.”</p>
<p>She protested, “Killing more monsters won’t make you stronger. The Old One is leaving.”</p>
<p>“Well, but you guys are still here with powerful items,” I pointed out.</p>
<p>Lunea grabbed her necklace as if she felt where I was looking at. Then, she hid it inside her school uniform shirt.</p>
<p>I sneered. “You are not fully ready yet. Did you think that I would say ‘Sure because we are on the same side now’ as soon as you came over and asked me to stop attacking you guys? If you are truly on my side, then you should tremble more in fear. Civil war is brutal. You must have gone through it before.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>I continued mercilessly, “There are monsters left on earth. None of those who come after us will survive either here or there. You would also know that Doom Kaos wouldn’t care about them as they are mere soldiers. Isn’t that why you came to beg me to be merciful? Lunea.”</p>
<p>She nodded bitterly. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“What will happen to your clan now?” I asked.</p>
<p>She frowned slightly. “What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I killed Doom Dejire, the god you worship, with my own two hands. Are you going to serve me?”</p>
<p>She shook her head. “I’m sorry, but there is nothing we admire about you.”</p>
<p>Then, Lunea looked at Yeon-Hee, as if they would have worshiped her if she had become Doom Man instead. Yeon-Hee smiled and shrugged at the absurd thought.</p>
<p>Lunea continued, “We are hoping to have peace with you until a new Doom, whom we can revere, is born.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Then, there is nothing more to say.”</p>
<p>Hwik!</p>
<p>It was a piece of cake for me to brush away Lunea’s hand and take away her necklace.</p>
<p>“We will collect the spoils from now on,” I stated.</p>
<p>The necklace swayed like a pendulum at the tip of my index finger.</p>
<p>“Is there anything you want?” she asked, capitulating.</p>
<p>I smirked. “Bring me one Book of Death and the main equipment of the commander-in-chief. Why? Are you surprised that I’m asking too little? Because I’m so generous?”</p>
<p>She stuttered, “N… No.”</p>
<p>I pressed on, “If they really want to stay alive, then they will have no choice but to give those things away. It’s not a difficult calculation. But if you waste your time and ruin everything…”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I will go directly to the mainland of the Lunea, your land,” I threatened.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>For me, it was urgent to stop fighting against the monster corps to secure my people’s safety while cleaning up the aftermath of battle. This was because Jonathan was still confronting the monsters at this time, and I still didn’t know where Lee Tae-Han, who had gone missing, was now.</p>
<p>We divided ourselves into three groups. I told Seong-Il to find Lee Tae-Han, left Joshua to clean up the mess here, and Yeon-Hee and I headed toward where Jonathan was. Perhaps because the Lunea had a mission to prevent conflicts between monsters, there was no difficulty in playing the role of a messenger in the meantime.</p>
<p>The Barba Corps was swarming around the Light Pillar that Jonathan was in charge of. However, by the time I got there, I could tell that the Barba had no intention to continue fighting as they moved their troops to the back.</p>
<p>“It’s Lee Soo-Ah,” Yeon-Hee said.</p>
<p>As she said, I saw Lee Soo-Ah was staring at us from afar. Around her were Baclans that were twice her size moving around her like henchmen. There was no news from the Lunea, but for me, it was a great achievement just to stop the monsters’ attacks on Jonathan’s side.</p>
<p>We found Jonathan immediately. As expected, he was staggering in a pool of blood even though he had a high-level healer next to him. It hadn’t been long since the battle ended, and everyone was groaning from pain and exhaustion.</p>
<p>Jonathan collapsed when he saw me and Yeon-Hee approaching him. His face was contorted with pain, but he was clearly relieved. I nodded to Yeon-Hee, and she squatted in front of him to make eye contact with him. Following that, she sent the memories of what we had done to Jonathan.</p>
<p>When she was done, Jonathan telepathically messaged me.</p>
<p>- So when can we go back?</p>
<p>I responded.</p>
<p>- When the Old One completely gets out of the way. Precisely, it will be the moment when the power of the Old One, who is crazy about our homeland, disappears.</p>
<p>He nodded.</p>
<p>- Perfect. As a matter of fact…</p>
<p>Jonathan looked at his subordinates who were around him. The battle had been interrupted, but they were busy preparing for the next battle, thinking it would only be a temporary lull.</p>
<p>They checked their armor and weapons with eyes filled with rage, chewed blood-stained jerky although they had no appetite, and murderous intent bubbled out of them. They didn’t care that their quest windows hadn’t popped up for a while and didn’t wonder why either.</p>
<p>Jonathan continued.</p>
<p>- I had trouble dealing with certain guys in my corps. You would agree that these will only cause problems in our society. Right, Sun?</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>- Of course.</p>
<p>- Let’s put all of them in different dimensions. That’s good… That would be better… But we should remove those we shouldn’t take. I have a few guys on my mind. I wish I could take lots of time…</p>
<p>I shook my head because it was something that even Doom Man couldn’t do.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, notification messages began to show up.</p>
<p>[The Old One has run away.]</p>
<p>[The power of the Old One, who was crazy about your homeland, is rapidly disappearing.]</p>
<p>[Remaining Time (Extinction): 59 minutes 59 seconds]</p>
<p>I said to Jonathan.</p>
<p>- The timer has just started. Exactly an hour from now, we will return to our home.</p>

<p>Chapter 320</p>
<p>Lucy opened her eyes, and there was still blood in her mouth. Since she could feel pressure from all directions, she suppressed her groans and quietly looked around. The place was in complete disorder, and people who had barely come to their senses or were injured were scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>We lost as expected.</p>
<p>As soon as he showed up, things were already. Those named after gods were terrifying beings and had unbelievable powers. However, even they chickened out as soon as he appeared.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>She heard a scream from afar, it was a shriek of death.</p>
<p>A woman approached Lucy when she looked in the direction where the scream was. “You better stop paying attention to that. It’s very scary.”</p>
<p>“Who are you?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>“You’re basically slaving under a guy as his personal warehouse, right? I can tell at first glance. I’m Catalina.”</p>
<p>She responded, “Lucy.”</p>
<p>Lucy was amazed by Catalina’s beauty. Although the other woman was covered with blood and mud, her glamorous body and fascinating eyes stood out vividly.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lucy wondered why she was impressed by Catalina when she was teetering between life and death. It was only after staring at her face for a long time that Lucy realized it was because there wasn’t much time left before going back home.</p>
<p>Only those named after gods and their subordinates did well in this world, but the weak ones like her had been waiting for this day to come. She often brought up old memories like music, food, and movies, especially after entering the Final Stage, to console herself.</p>
<p>She suddenly said, “I know you, Catalina.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“The Miami Gangsters[1].”</p>
<p>The movie was about the female protagonist, who was the boss’s girl and was in charge of the gang’s chores. She had left her hometown and taken control of Miami’s night streets when the Mexican gangs were purged. The main character of that movie who perfectly depicted the splendid human civilization then was right in front of Lucy. However, Catalina didn’t react the way Lucy expected.</p>
<p>Both of their heads turned at the same time when they heard another scream from the distance.</p>
<p>Catalina said, “If you are thinking of running away, don’t even dream about it. There is no reason for that, and our turns won’t come until the end.”</p>
<p>“How are things g…”</p>
<p>She was about to ask something but she hurriedly shut up when she saw a terrible presence wandering around as if it was patrolling the surrounding area. He was one of Osiris’s immediate subordinates, called the Plague Monster. They were known to be atrocious as hell, like their appearances.</p>
<p>Lucy’s heart began to pound even though he was far away from her.</p>
<p>“We are looking for those responsible. Don’t worry. They don’t even care about us. Do you mind if I sit next to you?” Catalina asked.</p>
<p>Lucy shook her head, and Catalina sat close to Lucy and their arms touched each other.</p>
<p>Lucy could finally afford to look at the other woman. Catalina’s equipment was extremely shabby, and her charismatic eyes that had resembled a movie star’s were now filled with a desperation to live. She soon realized that they were in the same situation.</p>
<p>Then, she saw eight insignias embedded in Catalina’s chest in a circle, which meant she wasn’t actually in the same boat with her. Catalina must have been used as a personal warehouse for a strong guy because of her outstanding beauty. Even in the rough stages, she was definitely guaranteed high-quality beef jerky and safety. Of course, she would have been brutally abused in return.</p>
<p>Catalina then said in a tone that she could tell what Lucy was wondering, “I killed Varuna[2].”</p>
<p>“Varuna?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>Catalina clarified, “He was my master from Act Two, Stage Four.”</p>
<p>Lucy was surprised. “How did you kill such a man?”</p>
<p>“He was charred by his own thunderbolt. You should have seen Varuna’s face as he begged for life. It was too entertaining for only me to watch.”</p>
<p>She wasn’t in a pleasant mood as she spoke in a monotone voice without any emotions as if she was reading a boring article. Lucy had some false hope that Catalina would be kind, but her expectation died down at that moment. People who had reached the end of this hell all had somewhat twisted minds regardless of whether they were weak or strong.</p>
<p>It was no different for a woman who had once lived a fancy life outside as a world-class actress. The actress had died and her soul was replaced by the warehouse Catalina.</p>
<p>Lucy became alert and regretted her carelessness in allowing Catarina to sit beside her. However, it was too late. Sure enough, she felt a cold object stabbing her back.</p>
<p>Catalina whispered, “Shhh. You can tolerate this, right? I’m going to cut off your spine if you scream. Then, I will twist your neck.”</p>
<p>Lucy responded, “You are bold. I don’t know why you are aiming for my life. I’m so useless.”</p>
<p>Lucy couldn’t understand this situation because it would be dangerous for her if she drew attention from other people. Even people who were named after gods were being executed without mercy, so their lives were…</p>
<p>Then, a thought suddenly passed through Lucy’s mind. She then noticed sights and sounds from far away that she had previously been unable to perceive. Everyone was shaking while looking at the Plague Monster, but they were still talking about the outside, where her family was waiting for her. ‘Family’ was a word that she truly missed even if she forgot their faces.</p>
<p>Family. Family! Family!</p>
<p>Lucy asked with certainty, “There is not much time left, right? Tell me, Catalina.”</p>
<p>She asked that way because she would burst into tears if she mentioned the term ‘family.’</p>
<p>“You must want to go back home, correct?” Catalina responded.</p>
<p>The extreme pain spread rapidly as if the dagger had torn the skin in her back.</p>
<p>Euk.</p>
<p>Lucy clenched her teeth and nodded.</p>
<p>“Yeah, the time is coming, Lucy. You will be able to go back home. Of course, if you hand me your insignias. Stop buying time and hand them to me right away.”</p>
<p>Lucy smiled at Catalina. “Oh, oopsy. You chose the wrong person. What is the point of robbing a C-class inventory? You don’t seem much different, but that’s a shame. Feel free to take them.”</p>
<p>Then, she wiped the smile from her face and said, “But Catalina. Wouldn’t two be better than one? I know who the A-class warehouses are, and I saw some around me right now.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“By the way, what’s going on? How much time do we have left?” Lucy asked.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Get rid of the dagger first.”</p>
<p>Lucy looked towards the distance. The number of people who were under the control of the Plague Monster were beginning to increase.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They had come to the conclusion that the value of insignias was bound to rise. For some reason, the System had stopped. The fact that quests had disappeared meant there would be no more boxes given to the Awakened.</p>
<p>Insignias had originally been rare because people usually chose to get items, not insignias. Therefore, they would inevitably become even more scarce in the near future.</p>
<p>Every cloud has a silver lining!</p>
<p>Lucy felt like her miserable life as a warehouse would end soon. Even if she wouldn’t be able to secure A-class insignias, eight C-class insignias were already stamped on her chest.</p>
<p>Moreover, it looked like she would go back home soon, considering the situation going around her. From a distance, the Awakened were divided according to their nationality instead of being in military formation. The leaders looked too busy to manage the warehouses as classifying the strong ones was already overwhelming.</p>
<p>This had never happened since Act Two had begun. Only then did Lucy fully grasp why Catalina had targeted her. It was her golden opportunity to secure more insignias. The gorgeous woman had obviously been planning to kill her and drag her body around to replace her insignias whenever she used her own.</p>
<p>“That’s him.”</p>
<p>Lucy’s eyes were fixed on one man as she looked at the movements of the plague monsters. He was an A-class warehouse. He was left on the street in a defenseless state.</p>
<p>“Is he the only one?” Catalina asked.</p>
<p>Lucy replied, “There is one more, so don’t worry. There will be enough numbers to share.”</p>
<p>They didn’t need more than two as the maximum number of insignias that they could each possess was eight. However, they were thirsty for insignias. Lucy and Catalina exchanged glances with greedy eyes and determination that they would replace all low-quality insignias they had with A-class ones before going back home.</p>
<p>Their plan worked. Lucy grabbed other Awakened’s attention when there were people around them, and when they were alone, they pushed the target into a corner together. It was possible only because the situation was chaotic and everything was being carried out in a hurry.</p>
<p>The moment when they started working individually was when one plague monster entered the area. His voice was as unpleasant as scratching metal, but his voice sounded like an angel’s song to Lucy.</p>
<p>“Where are you from?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The United States…” she responded meekly.</p>
<p>The plague monster did not explicitly tell her to join the group, but he looked at her in a way that made her feel pressure to return to the North American group immediately.</p>
<p>Lucy wrapped her arms around her body as if she was shivering from the cold and then joined the group of Awakened from North America.</p>
<p>She asked someone who looked weak.</p>
<p>“Do you think we are actually going back?”</p>
<p>He seemed to be a warehouse like herself or a person who was responsible for all sorts of dirty chores. It was easy to find such people because they had a certain vibe. She needed to find someone whose anger exceeded their confidence and was filled with the hope of returning to the outside world. And one of those who was very conscious of the strong in the public.</p>
<p>“I hope so. There, we should also…”</p>
<p>The man slurred the end of his sentence, then tears welled up in his bloodshot eyes as if he had become emotional for a moment. However, not many people seemed to empathize with him. This disaster had occurred because they had been rude to Odin as their leaders had made the wrong choice, but it was also because many people didn’t miss the outside world anymore.</p>
<p>There were eyes that regarded the outside as the next stage. In fact, people were busy preparing for the battle even though they had injuries and knew that they would be back outside soon.</p>
<p>Even the strong Awakened were searching for healers through the crowd, and the plague monsters had no intention of stopping them. They didn’t care as long as they stayed in the area they had set aside.</p>
<p>They must be Americans too.</p>
<p>The plague monsters were slowly separating based on their nationality as well. People, who made Lucy more hopeful, soon joined the group. Not only the defeated soldiers but also the residents of the savior’s city, who were known as fanatics, were divided by nationality.</p>
<p>Lucy moved aside just in case she got involved in a fight with them. Her body trembled with joy.</p>
<p>This is the evidence that we will return soon! Finally. I’m finally going back home!</p>
<p>Then, people started buzzing. There was something that captured her attention over other people’s shoulders. Her view was blocked immediately as people began to move, but Lucy definitely saw a gate. For some reason, the King of Hell and his people were walking out from there, where monsters were supposed to pour out.</p>
<p>Lucy knew it well. They were the ones who had confronted the monster corps to the end, and traces of fierce fighting against death were visible on their bodies.</p>
<p>Lucy was suddenly relieved that she wasn’t a part of them even though it was an opportunity to level up. She knew that people like her would have died immediately in such a battle. Also, she wouldn’t have returned home if she was a part of them.</p>
<p>She somehow felt warmth in her chest where eight A-class insignias were. They would be traded at a high price outside for sure as it was a place dominated by financial civilization.</p>

<p>Chapter 321</p>
<p>- Kwon Seong-Il!</p>
<p>- I’m here! Here! I found Tae-Han!</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han was in Seong-Il’s arms, and he looked terrible. His body was still going through regeneration as he had been severely injured. The stench of his festering wound was so disgusting that it made me frown unconsciously.</p>
<p>Seong-Il reported, “I found him in the pile of dead bodies. You know that I have a dog’s nose.”</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han stared at me with his remaining eye that was still intact. His face was covered with flesh and intestines, so it was hard to tell if he was an Awakened or a monster.</p>
<p>“Mary will treat you when she joins us,” I stated.</p>
<p>He muttered, “Zhang Weilong… the Lord of Heaven…”</p>
<p>“Do you think he is still alive after doing this?” I asked grimly.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han’s eye closed slowly as if he had heard the answer he wanted.</p>
<p>“By the way, Kciphos are weird. They ignore me and whisper by themselves. What if they betray us?” he suddenly asked.</p>
<p>I responded, “With monster corps… yes. It’s correct to say that we are in a state of truce.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Those on the last floor of the boundary will love this news. Quite a number were still fighting there.”</p>
<p>“How many?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Around ten thousand? They seem to be holding out somehow because the area they have to protect is small. I’m so proud of them,” Seong-Il said.</p>
<p>No, he was wrong. They were only battling because they couldn’t escape. Anyway, the remaining time was running out, and once all the power of the Old One got extinguished, time would resume on earth. In other words, the monster corps that were advancing toward the capital cities of major countries would move again.</p>
<p>Doom Kaos had suspended the order to attack our home, but it was highly likely that his commands didn’t extend to those who continued to attack human settlements outside. Even so, I couldn’t let go of those who had directly invaded the earth.</p>
<p>This implied that all Awakened were supposed to be prepared to return to their home before our human infrastructure was damaged by monsters’ sloppy attacks and before the power of the Old One dissipated.</p>
<p>There was no Stage of Rest. Also, unlike the past, we wouldn’t be returned to the place where we were moved to the stage.</p>
<p>“Our war here is over. We are now going back home,” I said.</p>
<p>Seong-Il stopped moving, and Lee Tae-Han flinched.</p>
<p>“Ki…Cheol… Can I really see my son, Ki-Cheol? This fucking hell is finally over.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il acted like he was about to burst into tears. We headed toward the inside of the boundary.</p>
<p>The scene, as described by Seong-Il, was filled with people engaged in combat against the Kciphos Corps. These were the people who made Lee Tae-Han, whom I had appointed as the commander of their corps, count the days of his death among the heap of dead bodies.</p>
<p>I could sense the anger emanating from Lee Tae-Han as he glared at them, but he then made an unexpected remark. “...It’s all… my fault… Argh. I learned a lot. So… please forgive… them…”</p>
<p>I nodded. “I will.”</p>
<p>These Awakened were not likely to be powerful anyway. Otherwise, they would have already escaped.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Light Pillar was still glowing brilliantly, and I had mixed feelings when looking at it. It was my last resort to reverse the Final Stage, but the only corps left were Lee Tae-Han and Jonathan’s corps.</p>
<p>The others had been blinded by rewards, so they had shifted responsibility to others and given up on the Light Pillars. The compensation for Yeon-Hee’s assassination quest was amazing, but it was shabby compared to the number of people who had moved to complete it.</p>
<p>But people still did it…</p>
<p>It was contradictory.</p>
<p>Those who had held their ground at the boundary, like Jonathan’s Corps, suffered heavy casualties. In contrast, the people who had targeted Yeon-Hee and others who congregated in the central area to engage the Barba Corps had a much higher survival rate.</p>
<p>There was an undeniable truth to this. We, humans, had been nothing but consumables to the Old One in the first place. It would have known the situation would end like this when it had created such a quest on Yeon-Hee. Those who had flocked to rewards didn’t deserve to stay alive, but in the end, the Old One was the cause of everything.</p>
<p>It victimized the entire population of Awakened to eliminate me. If the Old One’s stupid plan had succeeded and I died alongside Doom Dejire, then this stage would have been completely destroyed. I could have protected the remaining Light Pillar and waited for monsters to weaken, then slaughtered goldfish that ran out of the fish tank.</p>
<p>However… Just look at the consequences of the one quest that the Old One had devised! More than half of the Awakened who entered the Final Stage were killed by its joke.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It wasn’t just the Old One. I was pissed that we were in the middle of a battle between two absolute beings. Our human race definitely appeared insignificant to them. Acting subserviently only for the sake of our home security would bring dishonor upon ourselves.</p>
<p>I needed to keep my claws hidden until I was fully ready. If I continued to confront Old One as Doom Kaos’s sword slave, then I would find a way to end either Old One or Doom Kaos. It would be the path to true freedom.</p>
<p>“You are driving me crazy. Do you want to see the walnuts[1] in your head? I’m gonna break your nuts!” Seong-Il shouted while glaring at people behind him.</p>
<p>He looked sick and tired of those who were still being treated well. Those who were healthy were retrieving the bodies and caring for their comrades in exchange for items and insignias.</p>
<p>He snapped, “People with all four limbs intact, go carry the injured! Right now!”</p>
<p>The commotion momentarily ceased. Everyone immediately stopped their actions and prepared themselves for battle.</p>
<p>“Gate! It’s the gate!”</p>
<p>However, to their surprise, no monsters emerged from the torn space in front of them. It was because I had created it.</p>
<p>[Gate has been created.]</p>
<p>When I finished building the gate connecting Jonathan’s territory to the main stage, I realized that the power inside me had been quantified.</p>
<p>[Your Power has decreased by 1.]</p>
<p>[Power: 296 / 300]</p>
<p>It wasn’t the power sent by Doom Kaos because I had secured it by killing the Guide Lumah-le. As the traits Interdiction and Challenger had been removed, there were two additional spaces where new traits could be secured.</p>
<p>The question was whether there was anything left to replace them since the System was gone now, but that was something to find out in the future.</p>
<p>I entered the gate first, leaving the buzz behind. It didn’t feel much different from using the insignia Teleportation. In an instant, I experienced the sensation of something wrapping me around and swiftly tossing me away before it quickly vanished. I stretched out my legs, and they naturally stepped on the ground in the central area.</p>
<p>Things were more hectic there as the preparations for returning home were taking place more urgently than the ongoing combat. Even the survivors under Jonathan had just joined the group and were moving.</p>
<p>[Remaining Time (Extinction): 15 minutes 31 seconds]</p>
<p>There was no time to pay attention to Lunea as I hadn’t heard from her. I decided to ask why she hadn’t kept the promise, so I looked for Yeon-Hee first.</p>
<p>She was hugging her Kciphos, and Orca was beside her as always. People were standing far away from them as they were afraid of either Yeon-Hee, Orca, or both.</p>
<p>“They are going with us, right?”</p>
<p>She was talking about Kciphos and Orca.</p>
<p>I nodded and called in Seong-Il as our eyes had met from a distance. Seong-Il couldn’t take his eyes off the urgent situation around him even on his way to me.</p>
<p>We moved to our seats upon his arrival where the Korean Awakened were gathered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even though I counted those from other corps who tried to kill Yeon-Hee, those who were under Jonathan, and even a few who were labeled as fanatics, there was still only a small number of people.</p>
<p>However, that wasn’t the reason why it was so quiet. It was because those who controlled the Stage of Advent, including me, Yeon-Hee, her pet, Seong-Il, Lee Tae-Han, and Orca, had all walked in at once. Seong-Il had finished grasping the situation.</p>
<p>He said in an astonished voice, “Noona, weren’t there three hundred thousand Korean Awakened in the beginning?”</p>
<p>His tone was higher than usual because the fact that he would see Ki-Cheol soon was in the back of his mind.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“But only this many are left alive. I guess it’s around five hundred. Oh, gosh.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s comment caused everyone to pause as they realized that their survival chances had been minuscule, only five hundred out of three hundred thousand. They all stopped checking their injuries and armaments in silence.</p>
<p>The guy who was standing next to Ji-Ae noona was the same. They weren’t checking their condition due to the presence of monsters on earth. Rather, it had become a habit as they were uncertain of what was happening there. They soon started moving again.</p>
<p>At that time, Lee Tae-Han recovered from his suffering from Mary’s Touch. He seemed to have shaken off the memory of being attacked by his subordinates. He no longer looked at the others in a sharp manner.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked at Lee Tae-Han as if she was impressed, then shifted her gaze toward me.</p>
<p>- How long do we have left?</p>
<p>I responded.</p>
<p>- A few minutes.</p>
<p>- …We should figure out how to escape from Doom Kaos after we go back home.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee seemed to have been thinking the same thing as me all along. I had once told her that I wanted to make a peaceful outside world, where it would be safe to have kids. However, that hope seemed to have been pushed back one step.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s hands suddenly wrapped around my hands warmly. She asked.</p>
<p>- Do you have any regrets?</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>- I made the best decision I could and accomplished a lot. If I can effectively manage the Awakened, everything will return to normal. Your and my family will be able to enjoy ordinary life in such a world. For sure.</p>
<p>She nodded.</p>
<p>- That’s fine, then. That was my biggest concern. I was afraid you would have some regrets.</p>
<p>- No way.</p>
<p>She continued.</p>
<p>- Your past life was horrifying. No one living in this era has ever imagined that the path ahead of us would lead to the extinction of humanity.</p>
<p>I paused and then said.</p>
<p>- …You knew about it.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee knew that I was a past life returner.</p>
<p>- Why are you acting like an amateur? Of course, I knew it.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled softly.</p>
<p>- Then, you must have the same question.</p>
<p>- Which one?</p>
<p>I stated candidly.</p>
<p>- Was it really the Old One who gave me the chance to go back in time? When you are in doubt, it’s simple to think about who benefited the most. Doom Kaos secured me and the strongest corps ever.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee pursed her lips.</p>
<p>- Hmm…</p>
<p>I continued.</p>
<p>- If my assumption is correct, then this era might be just a pathway to obtaining us, the Awakened.</p>
<p>- Then… The next stage will be the real battleground between the Old One and Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>I reassured her.</p>
<p>- We will be able to find a way to not be played around by the tricks of either Doom Kaos or the Old One. I will find it for sure, so don’t worry.</p>
<p>- That’s too bad because this is the perfect time to kiss my pretty lips.</p>
<p>She sounded quite relieved.</p>
<p>- Why not?</p>
<p>When I grabbed her waist and pulled her toward me, she smiled.</p>
<p>- Calm down. You shouldn’t lose your dignity, Odin.</p>
<p>I replied teasingly.</p>
<p>- It’s the opposite. My dignity will double up if I kiss Mary, the Bitch.</p>
<p>[Remaining Time (Extinction): 0 minutes 0 seconds]</p>
<p>[The Old One, who is eager to conquer your homeland, has lost its power.]</p>
<p>- But I should go back and finish.</p>
<p>She pouted.</p>
<p>- Right now? Ugh, the timing sucks!</p>
<p>- Yes, right now.</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>For an instant, I felt a significant part of my power draining away, and space began to open in front of the Awakened gathered in each nationality’s group. Those who had waited for this moment eagerly shouted in excitement because they knew the pitch-black portal was the only way to return home. Others who put little meaning into this moment tightened their grips on their weapons.</p>
<p>I shouted at them all, “Slaughtering monsters left in the hometown is the top priority. Then, wait for instructions from the association. Go! To the land where you were born!”</p>
<p>The same words came out of everyone’s mouth despite their nationality.</p>
<p>Waaaaaaaah-!</p>
<p>Dust rose in the air, obscuring people’s line of sight. In the hazy sight, I could see the figures of those fleeing toward the gate.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said as she watched the Awakened disappearing quickly as if they were competing against each other.</p>
<p>- This era is over.</p>
<p>That was the best compliment to me.</p>
<p>1. Brain. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 322</p>
<p>The phenomena that had been previously incomprehensible could now be explained. Instead of invading them directly, the monster corps had no choice but to open gates near the capital cities of each country. This was likely due to the power of the Old One, who had desired to conquer the earth, which would have impeded their efforts.</p>
<p>When I entered the gate with Yeon-Hee for the last time, the shouts of the Awakened came to a stop as a nostalgic sight that they couldn’t even see in their dreams unfolded in front of them. We were in the middle of the intersection.</p>
<p>「City Hall Intersection」</p>
<p>The road was empty, and the traffic lights were turned off as if they had been dead for a long time. The only things that were vivid were the colorful vases on the sidewalks and blue lights reflected from the signs installed at every junction of the road. These were the true colors of our home!</p>
<p>「↑ Jungang-ro</p>
<p>← Seoul · Sadang · Yangjae</p>
<p>→ Gwacheon Government Complex · City Hall · City Council 」</p>
<p>「 Driving at red light strictly prohibited · Follow the sign 」</p>
<p>「 City Hall Intersection 」</p>
<p>「 → Gwacheon Foreign Language School · Gwacheon Girls’ High School 」</p>
<p>I wasn’t the only one who was scanning the Korean letters on iron signs. Everyone was turning their heads around. Some even murmured the words written on the sign aloud.</p>
<p>The sound of the loudspeaker went off, and everyone focused on it.</p>
<p>“This is a real emergency situation. Please follow the orders from the military and evacuate accordingly. This is a real emergency situation. Please follow the orders -”</p>
<p>A military vehicle with a loudspeaker was the only thing moving on the road.</p>
<p>“I’m terribly glad to see you again, you military punks.”</p>
<p>However, only Seong-Il greeted the vehicle. The other Awakened regarded the vehicle that was approaching us quickly as if it was a monster. It was possibly due to their traumatic memories regarding the soldiers from Act One.</p>
<p>Seong-Il looked back at me as if he was asking for permission. I nodded. Seong-Il’s speed shot up within one second, and he was now faster than that of the military car. He quickly approached the vehicle and rushed into the driver’s seat. The sound of the vehicle braking suddenly was loud and nostalgic. The skid mark was clear behind white smoke.</p>
<p>“What are you surprised about?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il expressed his excitement at the driver’s window. The soldiers disembarked from the passenger and back seats, while the driver remained stunned and speechless. They put their index fingers on the trigger while looking at us as if they had never seen such creatures before.</p>
<p>Although they weren’t aiming their guns toward us, they seemed to have instinctively felt the danger lurking in us. Even those with poor instincts would have found it unusual to see blood on us.</p>
<p>Seong-Il looked at me with an absurd face. I pointed at the military car and Seoul, then Seong-Il grasped the meaning immediately.</p>
<p>“We will take care of this place, so mind your own business,” he announced,</p>
<p>The soldier who got off the passenger seat yelled at him, “Who are you?!”</p>
<p>Seong-Il seemed to be smiling because his voice sounded mischievous. He was sincerely happy that he had returned home. “We are the warriors who have come back from hell.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean…” the soldier sputtered.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>Seong-Il punched the hood of the car, then he lifted the front end of the military vehicle, which had risen as a result of the impact from his hit. He pointed to a side of the road while grabbing the car on the other hand.</p>
<p>He stated bluntly, “Get out of the way. Don’t intervene because you will die.”</p>
<p>“A…are you guys… Awakened?” stuttered the soldier.</p>
<p>Seong-Il retorted, “Then what else are we? Do you have any hardtack?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee breathed heavily, then flared her small nostrils. Her voice was also filled with happiness as she smelled something delicious. There were not only public offices like the police station and fire department, but also the city hall and hotels in the area. Even if it had all been abandoned, there were abundant food ingredients and cooked dishes left everywhere.</p>
<p>However, the hardtack was enough for now. Seong-Il took the food away from the soldiers and shared them with everyone.</p>
<p>Crunch.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Tae-Han couldn’t take his eyes off the rooftop signs on the commercial building. I thought he was looking for something related to the Ilsung Group, but that wasn’t true. His eyes were fixed on the sign of Daehoo Securities.</p>
<p>I wondered if he was recalling how Jeonil Investment became Jeonil Group by acquiring Daehoo Group. Then, he probably began thinking about how the Jeonil Club was connected to everything.</p>
<p>Seong-Il broke pieces of hardtack into his mouth as he said, “Over there.”</p>
<p>It was from the Seoul Grand Park. I could hear the roar from there by slightly increasing my Sense. Yeon-Hee said that this era was over, but there were still some remnants remaining.</p>
<p>In the past, the Kciphos Corps had been divided into two troops once they entered Gwacheon. One headed to Gwanak-gu[1] by crossing Gwanaksan Mountain, and the other struck Seoul by entering Bangbae-dong[2] after taking Gwacheon-daero. This era would truly end only after eliminating those monsters.</p>
<p>The monsters hadn’t yet been separated into two troops. They were coming out from the extremely poor D-class gate.</p>
<p>I let the severely injured stay behind and sent the rest in that direction.</p>
<p>“My babies live here. Don’t leave anything behind!”</p>
<p>When Seong-Il stomped, the asphalt road broke into pieces and raised debris. Then, he ran quickly using big movements.</p>
<p>Everyone took a shortcut in the direction of where the monsters were gathered. No one used the open road. High-level Awakened such as Seong-Il and Lee Tae-Han leapt over the buildings. The others who couldn’t jump as high quickly jumped over the shorter, tightly shut iron doors of government offices and disappeared.</p>
<p>In an instant, the only people left around me were the seriously injured ones, Yeon-Hee, her pet, and Orca.</p>
<p>“Are you not going?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>I replied, “I better give them a chance first.”</p>
<p>It was their opportunity to protect their home with their own hands. Also, it was impossible to fail since Seong-Il and Lee Tae-Han were there.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sign said ‘Grand Park Road,’ but tanks were blocking the six-lane road. The tanks didn’t have faces, but I could tell what the young soldiers who were armed with rifles behind the tanks were feeling. They were frightened because they knew that the monster corps had made significant progress toward their location.</p>
<p>In addition, the military commander seemed to have a mission to take charge of the first gateway to Seoul, so he turned on the audio to boost their morale. It was Joshua’s speech at a press conference, which had been recorded again by a Korean voice actor.</p>
<p>“The realm known as the Stage of Advent operates on a separate temporal plane from our own. While time may pass within that realm, it does not here. As such, we may reappear fully armed and prepared at any moment, as if we are eliminating threats.”</p>
<p>“We ask that you await the return of those who will enter the Stage of Advent. And to those among us who will be undertaking the trials within that realm, please keep this message and us in mind. Together, we can overcome the dangers that threaten the New World.”</p>
<p>If he knew the truth back then, then the last sentences of his speech would have been different.</p>
<p>I heard the commotion of the battle in the direction of Seoul Grand Park. However, it only sounded like the roar was growing louder to the soldiers, so the commander promptly turned off the audio and ordered them to prepare themselves for action.</p>
<p>When the commander picked up the walkie-talkie, I was in front of him. The files in his hand were then blown away by the wind. The Armored Brigade 2 was in charge of the first gateway to Seoul.</p>
<p>I stated, “There is no need. We will put down monsters. We are the Awakened.”</p>
<p>I pointed at his walkie-talkie with my eyes. Even then, the commander and soldiers around him didn’t know what to do. It was difficult for people to accept that a supernatural being had suddenly appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>Then, a soldier approached with a tablet PC. Yeon-Hee joined behind me and looked at the tablet PC with sparkling eyes. A video filmed from above was being delivered at the moment. It was a crucible of slaughter there. The Awakened were raving, and modern technology couldn’t even track Seong-Il’s movement. Wherever the black dot, believed to be Seong-Il, went, blood splashed here and there.</p>
<p>Seong-Il was already at the top of the gigantic Kciphos’s head. Right then, the camera captured the top of Seong-Il’s head and wide shoulder line.</p>
<p>That was all. The camera failed to film how Seong-Il blew the giant monster up. The black dot shifted again. He was mercilessly killing monsters, and some of the other Awakened were darting swiftly among the monsters as if the video had been fast-forwarded.</p>
<p>It reminded me of the moment I replayed the video of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues fighting against the incarnation of Doom Caso multiple times. No matter how much I slowed down the video, it was challenging to keep track of their movements. It was impossible to follow their speed unless I watched the scene in person. That was the limitation of modern technology.</p>
<p>The commander gulped. His confused gaze was slowly shifting from the tablet PC to me.</p>
<p>“Right now, the government proclaimed…”</p>
<p>He glanced at me while slurring the end of his words. Then, his eyes moved toward Yeon-Hee and the pet in her arms. The furry and plump creature didn’t look dangerous. However, he stepped back and placed his hand on the pistol, likely due to knowledge of the Kciphos’s true identity.</p>
<p>He asked from a distance, “Who is in charge?”</p>
<p>I responded, “Me.”</p>
<p>He continued, “Please gather all the Awakened as soon as the suppression is over. Are there…”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee interjected, “You are making a big mistake now. Oh, my. Hehe.”</p>
<p>Regardless of Yeon-Hee’s laughter, he did his job.</p>
<p>“Are there any more than this?”</p>
<p>The commander looked at the video on the tablet PC. Then, he turned to Orca, who didn’t move from behind my shoulder. He definitely felt an extreme sense of danger from Orca, who was disguised in a necromancer’s robe.</p>
<p>He coughed and said, “I should report to the superior, first.”</p>
<p>“ To martial law enforcement headquarters?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I ordered, “Tell both of them to come here.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>I demanded, “Both martial law commander and the President. Right now.”</p>
<p>The commander’s face hardened instantly and wrinkles formed between his eyes.</p>
<p>“I will report that…you guys…umm…have requested that. But we, the martial law forces, have the right to control every situation across the country. All the Awakened should follow…”</p>
<p>The tablet PC in the commander’s hand was now in Yeon-Hee’s hands. She threw it on the ground and said mischievously, “No, no. You guys don’t deserve to watch this.”</p>
<p>“What are you doing?” the commander yelled at her.</p>
<p>“What about the military? Hey, Joo-Sang. Do you want to make a bet whether or not you can dress us in military uniform or not? I'm saying this because I feel sorry for you. Stop there and don’t make us hate you even more.”</p>
<p>When I shook my head at her, she stepped back with an apologetic expression.</p>
<p>I said one thing to the commander’s face, “Tell them that Jeonil Group wants to see them. You can confirm my identity with the female chairman of Jeonil.”</p>
<p>This was the world where the name ‘Jeonil’ worked better than the name of the Awakened. This was South Korea, a country ruled by Jeonil.</p>
<p>1. Gwanak District. It is located on the southern skirt of Seoul. ☜</p>
<p>2. Neighbourhood of Gangnam area in South Korea. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 323</p>
<p>“It’s from the president of Jeonil.”</p>
<p>The commander was more taken aback by Jamie than by me suddenly appearing in front of him and by the bizarre sight that he had seen from the video of the tablet PC. Yes, these would have felt more real to him than talking to Jamie. The voice of a powerful woman who could remove the stars[1] on his epaulet was more terrifying than the monsters.</p>
<p>I found the Ilsung Group’s logo on the smartphone that the commander handed over to me. A bitter smile spread across my face.</p>
<p>I said on the phone.</p>
<p>Jamie’s startled voice immediately popped out.</p>
<p>I hung up the call and prepared myself. Yeon-Hee nodded as if she understood why I was just staring at the phone instead of touching it. She also had a smartphone in her hand, but she was having difficulty contacting her family as well.</p>
<p>The only areas where the communication network was cut off were Anyang and Gunpo, where the monster corps had swept through. The Jeonil Resort, where families of key figures had gathered including mine and Yeon-Hee’s, was always accessible through phone calls.</p>
<p>However, that had been my mistake. The only sound I heard when I gathered the courage to call my father was an automatic voice message saying that the connection was being delayed due to a large volume of calls. Jamie was able to reach me as she used a special line.</p>
<p>Anyway, I now understood why Yeon-Hee didn’t join me in Act One when she could by using the returning stone.</p>
<p>I was still covered in blood from the Stage of Advent, and my parents would be able to smell it. They would even notice what I had gone through from my voice alone. Parents usually noticed changes in their kids quickly.</p>
<p>But still… I had to call them as soon as possible.</p>
<p>“It’s not working. I will try later.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled and began touching her phone. She acted as she had never seen the applications installed there, and she stared at the camera icon for a long time. Then, she smiled at me and turned on the camera application. Yeon-Hee looked around through the smartphone lens by moving it in all directions.</p>
<p>Then, the commander came back in.</p>
<p>“Are you done with your call?” he asked.</p>
<p>He seemed very curious about who I was. His attitude had become cautious, and he accepted my orders.</p>
<p>I responded, “I should call my parents, but the connection is pretty bad. Send them a message that their son is safe here. You should send it to Jeonil Resort. To Na Jeon-Il and his wife.”</p>
<p>Father must have been concerned about me, his son, who had suddenly vanished while watching the destroyed cities and monsters on the television.</p>
<p>“And find a way to contact them as soon as possible,” I added.</p>
<p>He replied, “Yes, sir. The martial law commander and VIP will come after suppressing the monsters.”</p>
<p>“The female president of Jeonil is flying here at the moment,” I replied.</p>
<p>He paused before finally saying, “...That’s what I heard. I will double-check and report to you again. Also, we have recovered the injured at the Gwacheon City Hall intersection as you have requested. We have sent the best medical staff in our military to treat them, so don’t worry.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “If anyone complains of pain, just administer a strong sedative. Also, don’t approach anyone whose face is covered in darkness.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>The commander saluted me and left the barracks. Then, Yeon-Hee laughed out loud.</p>
<p>“Gosh, his attitude did a complete 180, hahaha. If he had entered the stage, he would have been a leader or something. Or… He would have died in Act One, Stage Two. Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>They provided us with some water to wash ourselves. There was enough for everyone as they had brought an entire water hose.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee tried to get undressed on the spot without being aware of the surroundings because it had become her habit in the Stage of Advent. However, she stopped immediately as she felt people glancing at her. Only her chest and bottom were barely covered, exposing the rest of her skin. In fact, her underwear made of monster leather didn’t perfectly cover her.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said as she washed up, “Look at them. They are not afraid of me. This feels weird, hehe.”</p>
<p>I smiled grimly. “Enjoy it while you can. That will only last a couple of hours.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was very impressed by the Awakened’s work.</p>
<p>Kciphos warriors that were riding steeds had popped out from everywhere in the Seoul Grand Park. However, the axes that should have been held in their hands were nowhere to be seen. Some of them were barely alive, and there were Awakened chasing them.</p>
<p>Sheeeeeek-</p>
<p>Right when the soldiers were ready for the battle on a barricade made of armored cars, Yeon-Hee jumped out first.</p>
<p>- I can take a shower again. It’s so nice that I can say something like this.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s telepathic reports were fast, and she was also quick at slaughtering the Kciphos warriors. She might have wanted to brag that she could finish such petty monsters by slicing them a few times without using her main skills.</p>
<p>Her use of a dagger was delicate. She started off by cutting off the neck of the steeds and warriors, then sliced their abdomens and hearts where mana stones were. Those four simple movements morphed into one set that easily slaughtered and killed any Kciphos in front of her. She was so fast that it was difficult to determine what the curse of the Clown’s Dagger was.</p>
<p>The road in front of the barricade was tainted with monster corpses along with blood and intestines flowing out from them.</p>
<p>“Do you guys need help?” Yeon-Hee asked the Awakened who had joined the back.</p>
<p>One responded, “No, it’s almost over.”</p>
<p>“How bad is the damage?” she asked.</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>“Nice. It would have been embarrassing if there had been any because the monsters’ levels are so low. Anyway, you guys have just saved your country with your own hands. Have some pride.”</p>
<p>The person nodded. “Yes, ma’am.”</p>
<p>The Awakened ran back into the battlefield, then Yeon-Hee turned toward me. The ground where she was standing was covered in blood. Her entire body was soaked as if someone had poured a bucket of blood on her. More blood was flowing along her hair and skin.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee walked slowly toward me while juggling her dagger. She was obviously happy, but she seemed annoyed by the soldiers. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have shown off her ability like that. Everyone now looked at her in dread as her entire body was covered in blood, and she had a wicked smile on her face.</p>
<p>When Yeon-Hee returned to me leaving blood-stained footprints, no one even glanced at her.</p>
<p>“Did you see that?”</p>
<p>“Did you?”</p>
<p>They only whispered to each other.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Soon, Yeon-Hee received the things that she had been waiting for. She changed into proper underwear given by the soldiers, then turned around to face me.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it too big?” she asked.</p>
<p>I could definitely see the space that was left in the bra, but I shook my head. Yeon-Hee started getting dressed and rolled up the tent. Then I heard Seong-Il and Lee Tae-Han getting closer to us. When they came into view of everyone, the entire area fell silent.</p>
<p>The heightened emotions that had been aroused by the heat of battle didn’t easily extinguish. The sight of them walking around while glaring with murderous intentions and dripping blood would have been another unrealistic scene for soldiers. They must have looked like butchers who had just finished their meals.</p>
<p>People made their way to them even without the commander’s instructions. Apart from their stench, the Awakened looked down at the soldiers with a frantic gaze. Only a few hundred had entered the area, but the entire brigade was overwhelmed by them.</p>
<p>The commander stared blankly at them in front of the barracks and turned to me.</p>
<p>I said, “I saw a hotel beside the City Hall. Ask them and make sure to serve meals, clothes, cell phones, and whatever else they want. The cost doesn’t matter. Charge all of it to Jeonil Group.”</p>
<p>The commander immediately replied that he would follow my order even though my instructions could have provoked the soldiers’ anger. It might have been because he was overwhelmed by the Awakened’s charisma.</p>
<p>Seong-Il ignored the commander and came into the barracks. “Gosh, noona. I had a hard time recognizing you. So pretty!”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Tae-Han was asking the commander for a smartphone. The commander hadn’t noticed who he was due to his blood-stained face.</p>
<p>“Thanks for your kind words, Seong-Il. But oopsy. You should stay with the residents of the savior’s city and work a bit more.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee had taken the words out of my mouth. It was one of the topics we had talked about before the Awakened returned.</p>
<p>“I need to go check Ki-Cheol,” he stated.</p>
<p>“I heard you have dealt with mana stones, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>He blanked and nodded. “Oh my. Yes, once upon a time. I forgot about it until you brought it up.”</p>
<p>She ordered, “Collect everything.”</p>
<p>He tilted his head to the side. “What is the point? They are useless now.”</p>
<p>“The sooner you finish it, the faster you can go see Ki-Cheol,” Yeon-Hee insisted,</p>
<p>Seong-Il groaned. “Ah, please, noona. Damn, this drives me crazy. How can a person who can see people’s minds so well not understand how a father feels?”</p>
<p>“Were you going to see him without a gift?” Yeon-Hee responded slyly.</p>
<p>He blinked, clearly confused. “What?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee chuckled. “You should bring him a gift. And are you going to go like that? Your son will faint if you see him the way you are now.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il whined, “But isn’t picking up stones the job of the lower ones? Well, I still don’t understand why we need them.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee shook her head. “They are not just stones. They are mana stones.”</p>
<p>“Then, I’m going to bring soldiers, okay? I’m going to kill anyone who has sticky fingers.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee shrugged. “I don’t know how many would be able to even look at dead monsters, but sure. That’s up to you. Let’s go see Ki-Cheol after finishing this quickly, Seong-Il. I’ll prepare a quality present for him.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il nodded. “Okay. All I have to do is retrieve mana stones, right? What about their leather or heads?”</p>
<p>“We don’t need those. Also, collect the drop items as you see them.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il barked out a laugh. “You are giving me more orders, so I’m going to leave before you give me more. I’ll see you later!”</p>
<p>Seong-Il gave me a short nod and went out of the barracks. Military trucks were carrying the Awakened and moving in the direction of the hotel I mentioned. The injured, who had been moved separately, seemed to be moving together at that time.</p>
<p>I approached Lee Tae-Han. He showed no excitement even though the smartphone in his hand had his group logo.</p>
<p>I ordered, “Prepare for the press conference.”</p>
<p>There seemed to be no need for an order to stay neat in a suit. Lee Tae-Han’s eyes trembled with surprise. He had expected that I would choose him over Joshua, but upon hearing it in person, he had to have accepted the new reality. He lowered his head, deeply touched.</p>
<p>As Lee Tae-Han wiped the blood and gore from his face, the commander finally recognized him. However, the commander’s reaction was interrupted by the sound of a helicopter approaching from the sky.</p>
<p>Jamie, the Jeonil Group’s leader, had departed from Jeolla-do[2] and arrived before the president and martial law commander who were nearby.</p>
<p>Jamie got off the helicopter and ran straight toward me, but she flinched for a bit when she noticed bloody footprints on the ground. Like everyone else, she didn’t understand how long we had suffered for and how terrible the Stage of Advent was.</p>
<p>That was why she had lamented that she hadn’t selected to be awakened. She was sad that she had not been able to join me. Yeon-Hee burst into laughter as she looked at Jamie and how ridiculous she was acting.</p>
<p>Then, Jamie read the intimidating atmosphere in the area. She definitely felt a sense of incompatibility with Lee Tae-Han. It wasn’t just because of the stench of blood coming off of his wet hair.</p>
<p>“Were you one of them as well, Mr. Lee?” she asked.</p>
<p>The two had seen each other, but Lee Tae-Han left without answering. In the past, his reaction would have been impossible because he had merely been the President of the Ilsung Group.</p>
<p>Jamie looked at Lee Tae-Han’s back with a thoughtful face, then turned toward me.</p>
<p>I asked her, “The connection seems to be off. You must have a special line, right?”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>I ordered, “Phone my parents.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>She asked while touching her smartphone’s screen, “But how long were you there for?”</p>
<p>1. The more stars they have on their epaulets, the higher their ranks are. ☜</p>
<p>2. A province in Southwestern Korea. Its capital city is three hours away from Gwacheon by car and an hour away by plane. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 324</p>
<p>Son…</p>
<p>Tears welled up in my eyes upon hearing the sound of his voice, but I swallowed them all to keep my sadness at bay. Jamie and Yeon-Hee kept their mouths shut, and silence filled the air. After I gave Yeon-Hee the phone, she left the barracks.</p>
<p>Not long after that…</p>
<p>“Aaaargh-!”</p>
<p>I heard a man screaming. The martial law officer was rolling around the road with his hand severed, blood spurting out in every direction. Yeon-Hee was holding his hand, and she was also holding a cell phone that appeared to be his in her other hand.</p>
<p>All the guns in the area were pointing at her, but of course, Yeon-Hee was calm. She only cared about the few drops of blood that had splattered on her clothes. She started walking towards me. Several military officials yelled at her not to move.</p>
<p>At that moment, I was the only one who could see her sudden movement. She leapt into the air.</p>
<p>“My hand! My haaaaaand!”</p>
<p>His scream became louder. Nevertheless, the soldiers who were aiming rifles at Yeon-Hee and the officers who ordered her to stop moving were stunned. Yeon-Hee looked at me, then took the phone away from his hand. It was then thrown to the floor like worthless garbage.</p>
<p>The officer’s phone, which was given to me, contained pictures of Yeon-Hee. Specifically, they were images of her speaking on the phone with her family.</p>
<p>At that time, Jamie looked at the severed hand in front of her feet.</p>
<p>I said, “Jamie.”</p>
<p>She lifted her head in surprise. I showed her the pictures that had been secretly taken by the officer of Yeon-Hee. The commander was uncertain how to handle the sudden situation, but Jamie made it easier for him to make a decision quickly.</p>
<p>She rebuked him, “Is he not going to have surgery? Hurry and pick it up. Also, how in the world are you managing your subordinates? I can’t believe such an incident happened in front of me.”</p>
<p>At the same time, Yeon-Hee ignored the disturbance and turned her head toward the hotel.</p>
<p>She sent me a telepathic message.</p>
<p>- You know about it, right? Operation Noose seems to have started. I will go and check.</p>
<p>I shook my head.</p>
<p>- No, it’s okay. They can deal with it.</p>
<p>She smiled slightly.</p>
<p>- That’s true.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee spoke sharply as Jamie glared at her, “Are you serious? It was just a hand! You are going to freak out if you know what’s actually happening out there.”</p>
<p>Jamie was intimidated by Yeon-Hee and unconsciously avoided her gaze. Then, she looked at me in a way that was clearly asking for an explanation.</p>
<p>I explained, “This is Mary. You will be able to figure out her identity in Korea, but I hope you don’t. I don’t want that either.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee continued, “Nice to meet you, Jamie. I think we will bump into each other a lot from now on. It means you don’t need to peek at me.”</p>
<p>I added, “Treating her the same way as you treat me will be beneficial for you, but that’s not an order.”</p>
<p>Jamie paused and finally said, “...Okay, but it was a hasty move on her part. Everyone was watching, and it happened in an area under martial law. Also, the military officer was the victim. This case will hold her back in the future.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and I snorted at the same time.</p>
<p>I stated, “We were there for at least twenty years. There must be people who spent longer there than that. However, time shouldn’t be dealt with numbers.”</p>
<p>Jamie finally heard the answer to her previous question. She looked at me and Yeon-Hee’s faces in confusion.</p>
<p>I clarified. “The Awakened never age.”</p>
<p>Her eyes widened. “...Wow. Everything you are telling me is amazing. Like the fact that you lived in a different time and space, and that your aging process has stopped… How can that happen? Then… how many came back alive?”</p>
<p>“Fewer than two hundred thousand.”</p>
<p>I added an additional explanation for her as she didn’t understand how paltry that number was, “We started with forty-five million, and only that number came back alive. Do you understand what kind of place it was now?”</p>
<p>Jamie’s pupils dilated as she was in deep shock. In particular, she now looked at Yeon-Hee differently.</p>
<p>She said cautiously, “Ms. Mary. I can’t imagine how terrible it was the experience the years you have. Nothing I could say could possibly comfort you. But… I’m sorry to use this expression, but you need treatment. For yourself, not anyone else.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee interrupted sharply, “I’m also Odin’s person and his girl. I don’t break your rules, Jamie. Why don’t you go get that treatment instead?”</p>
<p>Jamie appeared even more startled as she realized that Mary had read her thoughts.</p>
<p>I clarified, “Mary has a mental attribute, so she reads people’s minds. She is also the strongest out of all Awakened except me. You better not play any tricks with her.”</p>
<p>“Said Odin,” Yeon-Hee smiled.</p>
<p>Jamie’s first reaction was to cover her head with both hands in a hurry. Then, she looked around in a confused gaze, panicking as she didn’t know where to look. She then shifted her gaze toward me. She was asking for permission, so I nodded.</p>
<p>She ran out of the barracks as if she was running away. After a while, she came back with the smell of cigarettes.</p>
<p>“Am I permitted to listen to all of this?” she asked, clearly frazzled.</p>
<p>I shrugged. “I won’t be able to make sure that everyone keeps their mouth shut. Mary is famous among us. As well as Jonathan and Joshua. Also, ‘Odin’ is no longer just the name for the club. We can’t tell you everything about what happened over decades, so ask Lee Tae-Han instead.”</p>
<p>Jamie blinked. “Are you talking about President Lee of Illsung?”</p>
<p>I continued, “You will build an association with him. Prioritize it over the Jeonil Group and the French corporation.”</p>
<p>She nodded hesitantly. “Okay… But these people are late. I’ll check how far they are from here.”</p>
<p>She was referring to the president and martial law commander.</p>
<p>I commented, “I thought the Jeonil Group would know everything even in the situation of martial law, but I’m disappointed.”</p>
<p>“...What do you mean?” Jamie looked taken aback.</p>
<p>I smiled grimly. “Operation ‘Noose.’ There is an ongoing scenario in the martial law army.”</p>
<p>The commander had brought up the topic of martial law and military control as soon as he saw us because there were specific orders he needed to carry out. It stemmed from a secret operation within the military following Joshua’s press conference.</p>
<p>However, they couldn’t avoid Yeon-Hee finding out. That was why Yeon-Hee had showed off her ability and expressed her dissatisfaction with them. The martial law officer, who secretly took pictures of Yeon-Hee, didn’t do it out of personal curiosity.</p>
<p>The hotel where the Awakened were moved must be a sea of blood by now. When I raised my Sense, I could hear urgent voices from there. There was a conflict in the process of martial law forces trying to separate them one by one.</p>
<p>“This is my fault.”</p>
<p>Jamie, who had just learned about Operation Noose, seemed to take it seriously.</p>
<p>No. The problem was those who regarded martial law as absolute power. Of course, it was a great power that controlled not only individual property rights but also basic rights, so it was natural for them to think that way. However, the real problem was they didn’t know that I had the authority to lift that law at any time!</p>
<p>The situation in Korea was dire. The president and martial law commander were unaware of my true identity and were operating under false assumptions. Perhaps they believed that this was a chance to free their country from foreign control. If that was the case, I was willing to applaud them.</p>
<p>It had been a while since the incident at the hotel had ended. The president’s situation was similar to what had happened in North America. Despite the maneuvering of the club, he had been elected as the leader of this country. However, that didn’t mean he could reject the club’s order.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“They are extremely dangerous, sir. Please consider increasing the number of bodyguards right now.”</p>
<p>“No, I don’t need any of them. By the way, what did the martial law commander say? Did he say it wouldn’t work?”</p>
<p>“I can use my authority to serve you personally. They are the ones who have calmly requested food even after committing brutal slaughter. They are murderers with extraordinary abilities. To have a private meeting with the leader of such individuals would mean…”</p>
<p>“It’s not a one-on-one meeting. The female president of Jeonil will be there, so nothing will happen.”</p>
<p>After the scuffle had stopped, the president came in with a gentle smile. He even smiled at the Kciphos, which was in Yeon-Hee’s arms. He wouldn’t be able to smile like that once he figured that we were aware of Operation Noose.</p>
<p>Anyway, he came in alone with no entourage.</p>
<p>He stated pompously, “This country will forever be grateful to you, the Awakened, for defeating extraterrestrial beings. We deeply appreciate your efforts. I extend my personal thanks and those of the entire nation.”</p>
<p>He bent his waist, then looked at Jamie. He wanted Jamie to act as a bridge between us. Jamie lived up to those expectations, but it wasn’t in a way that he wanted it to be.</p>
<p>She stated firmly, “Mr. President, it is imperative that you end Operation Noose without delay. Continuing it will only lead to more casualties among our troops.”</p>
<p>“Operation Noose? Haven’t you guys already suppressed the alien creatures?”</p>
<p>He looked at me with a brazen look of surprise. After tapping Jamie on the shoulder, I stood up.</p>
<p>I heard the President’s bewildered voice behind me. “Wait, where are you going?”</p>
<p>My task of bringing him to Jamie was completed. He already knew the other identity of Jamie. He was already aware of Jamie’s membership in the club, but he didn’t know that she held a leadership position within it.</p>
<p>The president’s entourage and security personnel were stationed outside. Because of what we had already done, extreme vigilance filled their eyes as they looked at us.</p>
<p>We walked towards the hotel while hearing the president’s conversation that ended in a fit of embarrassed laughter.</p>
<p>“Haha. There was an unfortunate accident at the hotel, but I have never heard of Operation Noose. The Awakened must be very angry, and I apologize for this.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t mind that. It’s not even a big deal for them. They put down the alien monsters that the military couldn’t even do anything with. Anyway, the reason why I urgently invited you is because of martial law.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the reason… There is no guarantee that there will be no invasion of aliens again.”</p>
<p>“There can be a similar incident, but the association can sort it out without a problem. They are also certain that there will be no such large-scale invasion again. I’m sure the citizens want to be safe and go back to their jobs. Thousands of people, including myself, also hope for the lifting of martial law, Mr. President.”</p>
<p>“You mean the World Awakened Association, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Is President Joshua still at the resort? I would like to meet him.”</p>
<p>“I will arrange a meeting soon.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. I feel the same way, too. I also want my citizens to resume their daily life as quickly as possible. However, lifting martial law isn’t as simple as it sounds. Apart from getting approval from the cabinet, we must also take into account the global situation. We may have suppressed the invasion on our land, but other nations are still facing challenges.”</p>
<p>“No, the others have started the same discussion that we are having now Let’s check and take the measure right away.”</p>
<p>“I will consider it.”</p>
<p>“This is not a request.”</p>
<p>“You are going too far today, haha. Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>“I’m not saying this as the President of Jeonil Group.”</p>
<p>“...Is it from the club?”</p>
<p>“I cannot guarantee the national prosperity of Korea if you reject the order after meeting the owner of the club.”</p>
<p>“W…wait… That means… the guy who just left is…”</p>
<p>“Yes, he is the owner. Aren’t you happy as a representative of the government of this country? The owner of the world was born from your small peninsula.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Lift the law. It’s his order.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 325</p>
<p>In front of the hotel, Lee Tae-Han was having a serious conversation with an officer who appeared to be in charge of the operation. Then, he spotted me from afar, so they stopped talking.</p>
<p>As Lee Tae-Han approached me, the officer turned around and communicated via radio. Then, vehicles carrying martial law forces moved in perfect order. The scent of blood coming from the hotel was stronger here than the trail of fumes that cars left behind.</p>
<p>“The martial law will be lifted soon. Start the conference just in time,” I said.</p>
<p>He nodded. “Then, I will get to Seoul first.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled behind Lee Tae-Han’s back and said in a delighted voice, “See you at the hotel tomorrow. Bye for now!”</p>
<p>Despite the blood stains, she was pleased to be able to get into the hotel.</p>
<p>The entrance of the hotel was cluttered with evidence of the removal of martial law soldiers’ bodies, and the traces led to the lobby, elevators, and emergency stairs.</p>
<p>“This is not too bad. It seems like the situation ended without the Awakened doing anything.”</p>
<p>The lobby appeared as if it had been devastated by a storm, and nothing was left unscathed. The sight of the destruction was reminiscent of a bomb that had gone off. Rifles and limbs of the soldiers were scattered in a pool of blood, and hand prints stained the walls.</p>
<p>In the area with the heaviest concentration of blood, it was still seeping through the tile crevices. Yeon-Hee tracked the flow of blood and discovered a martial law officer in a corner. He was still in a panic even after everyone had withdrawn. He crouched there, trembling, and had clearly been there for a long time.</p>
<p>He was speechless and only gazed at Yeon-Hee with wide, quivering eyes.</p>
<p>“Coward.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee came back to me after saying that.</p>
<p>The best suite was usually on the highest floor of the hotel. We used the emergency staircases instead of the broken elevator.</p>
<p>“I promised Seong-Il that I would prepare a gift for Ki-Cheol. What would be a good one?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>There was nothing to worry about if it was for Seong-Il because nothing was better than a bottle of cheap soju and a bowl of ramen to us now.</p>
<p>We kept walking up the stairs as if we were chasing the trail of bodies being dragged away. Then, we came out into the hallway on the last floor. Although the genres all differed, we heard snippets of music greeting us.</p>
<p>Some had left their doors open, while others had closed them. Everyone had finished taking a shower, so they were enjoying the modern technology and civilization of the earth.</p>
<p>In an open room, I made eye contact with Ji-Ae. It had been a while since I last talked to her. As she had done every time she ran into me, Ji-Ae stopped what she was doing and slightly lowered her head toward me. It was obvious that she had no intention of returning to the Supreme Prosecutors’ Office.</p>
<p>We came into the empty room that had been prepared for us. Yeon-Hee threw herself onto the bed with a short exclamation. The room only had a mattress, but she enjoyed the softness of the bed as she buried her face in it. Then, she turned to me and smiled.</p>
<p>“I know now.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were shining.</p>
<p>“Gift?” I asked.</p>
<p>She smiled. “A wish coupon would be perfect. With our names on it. Odin and Mary. We will grant his wish whenever he wants to use the coupon!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Krong. Its real name was Kronos’ Chest Armor, but Seong-Il affectionately referred to it by its nickname and cherished it.</p>
<p>He was now happier than when he had first won Krong. We made the wish coupon by roughly tearing up a piece of memo paper that was provided in the hotel. Regardless of its rough appearance, it was more valuable than a challenger box due to the inclusion of Odin’s and Mary’s names.</p>
<p>Seong-Il definitely knew that this was for Ki-Cheol, not him. He had simply fulfilled his obligations and maintained his loyalty, but the reward he received was excessive.</p>
<p>Seong-Il put the coupon in his pocket, then rang the doorbell.</p>
<p>Woof woof!</p>
<p>He heard a dog barking in the yard. His ex-wife actually hated dogs, but she was raising this one to guard them from Seong-Il in case he broke in. Anyway, he was worried that Ki-Cheol might have gone to the shelter, like many others had, as there were numerous abandoned houses. But fortunately, he sensed people inside the house.</p>
<p>“It’s me.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il smiled at the intercom camera, and tears welled up in his eyes. He didn’t want to see his son with tears and a runny nose, so he put on a broader smile than usual and tightened his fists.</p>
<p>His ex-wife’s blunt question almost made Seong-Il cry immediately. He had longed to hear that voice. It was as if his nose was already running.</p>
<p>Then, the voice coming from the intercom changed.</p>
<p>Tik!</p>
<p>Seong-Il heard the door open. It was his first time entering the house. It had always been closed before, and in the past he only saw Ki-Cheol briefly on weekends near the station for less than an hour. As Ki-Cheol entered puberty, the frequency of their meetings decreased.</p>
<p>A beautifully maintained garden stretched out before him, which matched what he had heard about neighborhoods inhabited by wealthy elderly men. However, a madly barking dog was interfering with the heaven-like scene.</p>
<p>When Seong-Il stared at the dog, it ran into its house. Only then did the stunning view that he couldn’t even dream of in the Stage of Advent come into view.</p>
<p>His ex-wife and the old guy walked out of the house. In the meantime, her ex-wife kept her mouth shut tight, as if her husband had just scolded her to remain quiet. She was fierce like a pitbull when she had lived with him, but now she was gentle like a golden retriever.</p>
<p>“Thanks for opening the door. But where is Ki-Cheol?” Seong-Il asked.</p>
<p>“Calm down first,” the old man said.</p>
<p>“So where is Ki-Cheol?” Seong-Il asked again.</p>
<p>The old man smiled. “He is taking a shower. Come in first. A father wants to see his son, and there is no reason to stop that. This could be… the last time.”</p>
<p>Piles of daily essentials were stored in the house starting from the front door. Seong-Il sat on the leather couch while his ex-wife glared at him. The old man stared at him with an uncomfortable gaze, then went into the master bedroom.</p>
<p>Then, his ex-wife stood in front of him and said, “Can you stop shaking your legs? You are making me nervous too. And why do you look like that?”</p>
<p>She cast a disapproving look at Seong-Il. He was wearing a shirt and jeans that he didn’t usually wear, but the cuffs of his jeans and socks were soiled with mud.</p>
<p>Seong-Il quipped, “Aren’t you glad to see me again? I really wanted to see your face…”</p>
<p>She sputtered, “You… you… are… you’ve become insane since the world became chaotic, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry. I should have treated you better when we were married,” he suddenly apologized.</p>
<p>She grimaced. “Oh my gosh, stop! Do you think you will go to heaven if you atone for your sins? Then, why didn’t you go to church instead of here? You should be glad that my husband is a gentleman.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il sighed. “Ugh, never mind. I’m not here to fight you. I… I…”</p>
<p>She interrupted him with a hiss, “Then stop saying nonsense and be quiet. Okay? If you scare my son, I won’t let you go alive.”</p>
<p>Only then could Seong-Il focus on the sound from the washroom. He didn’t care about the pouring water. He concentrated on Ki-Cheol’s breathing, which sounded like something was scratching the nasal cavity due to his sinusitis.</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s vision became blurry, and he could no longer hold in his tears.</p>
<p>“Are you crying? Are you… actually?”</p>
<p>His ex-wife became speechless when she saw him crying. Then, tears began to flow from her eyes, which usually was only filled with disdain as if he was a crazy man. It was because of fear. She was shocked to see Seong-Il crying, as she had never witnessed him in such a state before.</p>
<p>She was afraid that the world was ending and that she would witness the monsters that had come to Seoul with her own eyes in this house. She squatted down and buried her face between her knees, then murmured while shedding tears nonstop.</p>
<p>“What should we do… what should we do…” she wailed quietly.</p>
<p>Then the sound of water running stopped in the washroom. Seong-Il began to cry harder.</p>
<p>Seong-Il blinked his eyes rapidly because he heard Ki-Cheol’s voice.</p>
<p>“I heard dad’s voice. Is he here?”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol came out of the washroom, and Seong-Il rose unsteadily. He attempted to shout his son’s name, but no sound came out of his mouth. He was still crying with tears and a runny nose, and his body continued to shake, hindering his movement. Ki-Cheol took a step back, but the wall was blocking his way.</p>
<p>Seong-Il only thought about one thing when he hugged Ki-Cheol tight.</p>
<p>‘I should control my Strength. Control it… If not, I will hurt my son.’</p>
<p>His son cried out, “What is going on? What’s wrong with dad? I’m suffocating. Cough. Mom. Mom! Stop crying. Oh my gosh! Please don’t fight. Please!”</p>
<p>She replied with an unsteady voice, “We didn’t fight, son. I told you not to scare Ki-Cheol. You… seriously… What’s wrong with you? Get out if you are going to keep doing this.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il didn’t realize his ex-wife was hitting his back at the moment. He felt as if the background had faded away and the sound around him quieted down. It was something that he had only felt when entering the gate.</p>
<p>His memories flooded through his mind, including his first meeting with Odin, to the moment Kang Ja-Seong, who looked like his son, had made the ultimate sacrifice for him.</p>
<p>Despite everything, he made it through and was now holding Ki-Cheol. Odin leading the way and Ki-Cheol pushing from behind were the only driving forces that had made him come this far. If either of them were missing, he could never come back alive.</p>
<p>“Thank you. Thank you.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il sobbed as he came back to his senses. His hands were on the ground without him realizing it after he let go of Ki-Cheol, who struggled. His wailing and tears hit the living room floor.</p>
<p>After a while, he carefully put his hand into his pocket as he suddenly remembered Ki-Cheol’s gift. He refrained from calling the coupon a ‘gift’ as he feared it would diminish its value, and chose not to give it a label.</p>
<p>“Keep this, and use it only when you really need it. This is worth countless lives,” he stated solemnly.</p>
<p>Seong-Il placed a coupon in Ki-Cheol’s hand.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“It’s a wish coupon. Mary and Odin will grant your wish when the time comes. It’s written there.”</p>
<p>“Mom. Dad is…”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol alternated his gaze between the coupon and Seong-Il, then faced his mother, appearing frightened. However, Seong-Il’s ex-wife, with her face buried in her knees, was still deeply afraid and unable to accept her son’s desperate look.</p>
<p>It was then that the old man came out of the master bedroom. His face was also filled with anxiety. Then, his gaze inadvertently turned to the television and was fixed there. He widened his eyes.</p>
<p>「 [Breaking News] Martial Law Command, ‘Defeated aliens in Gwacheon.’」</p>
<p>「 [Breaking News] Global Awakened Brings Increased Stability to Earth. 」</p>
<p>「 [Breaking News] The World Awakened Association’s Prediction Has Become Reality. Mankind on the Brink of Victory. 」</p>
<p>「 [Breaking News] Martial Law has been Lifted. 」</p>
<p>The old man increased the television volume, and Ki-Cheol and Seong-Il’s ex-wife also turned toward it.</p>
<p>“After a ten-day enforcement, the martial law was lifted as of 11 PM on March 17th, today. Despite the lifting of the law, residents in areas severely impacted by the recent alien invasion, such as Gwacheon, Anyang, and Gunpo, will remain under curfew.”</p>
<p>“The implementation of a curfew is a precautionary measure aimed at ensuring the safety and security of residents as they recover from the destruction caused by the attack. The Supreme Council for National Reconstruction is…”</p>
<p>The TV announcer’s voice was filled with excitement. The TV then had its connection for a moment, and then her voice reappeared, “The World Awakened Association has started a press conference.”</p>
<p>When Seong-Il looked up, he saw Lee Tae-Han. Within twelve hours, the blood stains on his face had vanished and his hair was neatly styled. He was dressed in a suit like a person who had never stepped onto the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Seong-Il got up on the floor and put his arm around Ki-Cheol’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol said, “Wait, dad. Let me watch this.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just Ki-Cheol. His ex-wife and her husband also couldn’t take their eyes off the television.</p>
<p>“Decades ago, I was an Asian entrepreneur. Decades ago, I was filled with anger and terror at the alien civilization that invaded our dear human society and beloved neighbors and families. The world was ablaze with numerous cities being destroyed, and we were powerless to defend against the alien invasion.”</p>
<p>He took a breath and continued, “As Director Joshua von Karjan had mentioned, our current firepower cannot subdue these monsters. Therefore, we would likely be forced to use nuclear weapons as a last resort.”</p>
<p>He paused and continued, “However, Director Joshua von Karjan’s prediction that we, the Awakened, would reappear ready to tackle any new threats at a moment’s notice had become a reality. This is real. We emerged from decades of relentless warfare in the Stage of Advent, and we were victorious over the savage alien civilizations.”</p>
<p>He smiled. “I would like to pay my heartfelt tribute to Director Joshua von Karjan for giving me this opportunity to deliver honorable news to the world, to all global leaders and officials who refrained from using our last resort, and to everyone who had faith in us and remained calm.”</p>
<p>He looked squarely at the camera. “Hello, I’m Lee Tae-Han, the president of the World Awakened Association.”</p>
<p>People clapped and applauded not just on the television, but Seong-Il’s ex-wife, his husband and Ki-Cheol also cheered as they jumped in joy. Seong-Il hugged Ki-Cheol, who threw himself into his father’s arms and sniffed.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han continued speaking from the television, “We humans have experienced fear and awe at the mysterious events that have occurred and have bestowed the name of gods upon some of the most powerful Awakened.”</p>
<p>He continued with gravity, “Today, I would like to tell you about Odin, the deity of Nordic mythology. Odin is the god of the sky, magic, war, and wisdom. He possesses wisdom in one eye, wields the power to summon storms and thunder with one hand, and brings victory with the other. He is considered the ruler of all gods. Odin was present in the Stage of Advent and has returned with us.”</p>
<p>He stated seriously, “Please remember us who fought under his name. The Association Director Mary, Director Osiris Joshua von Karjan, Director King of the Hell Jonathan Hunter, Director Caliber Kwon Seong-Il, and all other two hundred thousand Awakened will move on to the alien civilization that attacked our humanity, starting with today’s victory.”</p>
<p>He raised his fist and announced proudly, “We will bring back everything we have lost. We will bring reconstruction of the new world instead of being content with the current situation. We, the World Awakened Association, promise a new era for all mankind. Today’s victory is a great first step and turning point in human history, and we will prove to ourselves how strong our civilization is.”</p>
<p>The television then became noisy with Lee Tae-Han saying that he will answer questions. The old guy and Seong-Il’s ex-wife were still immersed in television, but Ki-Cheol was different. He was unfolding the memo paper that was crumpled in his hand.</p>
<p>「Wish Coupon</p>
<p>Content: From Odin and Mary, for Ki-Cheol, the son of Caliber Kwon Seong-Il. 」</p>
<p>“That’s not you… right?” he stuttered in disbelief.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol blinked his eyes quickly.</p>
<p>Seong-Il grinned. “It is me. I’m the Caliber Kwon Seong-Il!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 326</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won suppressed his rising anger. The Chuncugwan[1] was filled with complaints from the reporters entering the Blue House. The chief secretary and even the lowest-ranking employee in the office were absent, so the reporters had been left unattended.</p>
<p>This was impossible. The relationship between politicians and journalists was intertwined, making it challenging to distance themselves from each other. Therefore, creating a significant gap between them was nearly impossible.</p>
<p>It wasn’t only because the extraterrestrial beings had been repulsed. This was the moment when the invasion marked a pivotal moment for humanity as it had come to an end and people began to move forward towards a new beginning. The Blue House was responsible for actively releasing related information to the press.</p>
<p>However, the only thing known was the fact that three hundred thousand Koreans had entered the Stage of Advent and fewer than five hundred had returned alive. This was already disclosed at Lee Tae-Han’s press conference.</p>
<p>Reporters wanted to know who Odin and the surviving five hundred Awakened were, how they defeated the monsters, and what stance the government would have on the Awakened in the future.</p>
<p>The Blue House remained silent, and it was a terrible sign of neglect from them. The impeached government had been like this two years ago. Lee Soo-Won was certain that outdated media policies like this were the cause of the eighteenth political power’s impeachment.</p>
<p>What are they going to do by just pushing the press away?</p>
<p>If he and his colleagues hadn’t been seriously insulted there… If the Blue House didn’t treat the media poorly, then the entire media wouldn’t have turned its back on them. If so, then the eighteenth political power wouldn’t have collapsed due to impeachment.</p>
<p>“I guess they learned nothing from there. Reporter Lee, do you know anything about the Awakened?” a reporter sitting next to Lee Soo-Won asked.</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won was about to answer, but he closed his mouth as he suddenly felt chills going down his spine. The nineteenth government understood the media’s power better than anyone. They had witnessed the downfall of the previous government due to their harsh treatment of the media, and the current government was the one who benefited the most from it.</p>
<p>In fact, Lee Soo-Won had the itch to write something. He could condemn the government as much as he could for the destruction of the southern part of Gyeonggi-do. He could create a crack in the nineteenth government’s iron fortress-like approval rating. But the government knew about this, but they were in an inevitable situation where they couldn’t stop it from happening!</p>
<p>This meant an absolute power, which was stronger than the authority held by chiefs and administrators in the eighteenth regime, lurked behind the current government. They had sealed the Blue House’s mouth. Everyone knew who they were. It was so obvious that it was embarrassing to mention them.</p>
<p>Jeonil Group.</p>
<p>They had dominated the government and business of this country since the fifteenth regime. Ironically, their black-haired foreigner was in Korea when the first democratic government that everyone had longed for was born. Over the past twenty years, they completed a sanctuary that was absolutely inviolable unless the Proletariat Revolution[2] occurred in Korea.</p>
<p>They are too powerful.</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won was astounded at the fact that no one had survived after challenging Jeonil Group. Although he wouldn’t face the same physical torture in the Central Intelligence Agency[3] as he would have in the 1970s, those who challenged the group still faced the destruction of their social standing. Politicians, legal professionals, businessmen, and reporters had been ruined. After the Jeonil Gate incident, the extent of their destruction worsened…</p>
<p>People called the current government a ‘democratic regime,’ but it was more correct to refer to it as the ‘Jeonil regime.’ Therefore, Lee Soo-Won decided to proceed with the work through a foreign journalist who had more freedom. Before entering the Blue House to work as a reporter, he had worked as a correspondent in North America for more than three years.</p>
<p>Thanks to this, he was able to register as a member of the foreign press club in Seoul where he met Carrie. She happened to be in Seoul.</p>
<p>The next day, it was late afternoon when Soo-Won pulled over his car on the shoulder of Seoul City Hall Plaza.</p>
<p>「 We pray for the safe return of the Awakened and the souls of the departed. 」</p>
<p>People from all walks of life came to light incense in memory of the deceased.</p>
<p>A foreign woman approached him when she saw the hazard lights he had turned on. Lee Soo-Won got out of the car and opened the passenger seat.</p>
<p>He said, “The Stage of Advent began and ended in this country. Isn’t it too early for you to return home?”</p>
<p>Joshua von Karjan had announced the start at the Jeonil Resort, and Lee Tae-Han had finished at the Ilsung Hotel in Seoul, Korea. As Lee Tae-Han had stated, the defining moment for humanity, the “torrent,” was occurring in Korea and nowhere else. However, Carrie was eager to leave.</p>
<p>“This country is too restricted,” she answered.</p>
<p>He responded, “It’s because of the Jeonil Group. I can’t access them, but you can in many ways. I want to help you.”</p>
<p>“But it won’t help you in your career,” she said.</p>
<p>Carrie hit the mark. She was saying that even if he collaborated with her to make a scoop about Jeonil, he wouldn’t be able to publish it as an article. She was well aware about the ecosystem in Korea.</p>
<p>He insisted, “Jeonil Group is a mountain we have to overcome one day in Korea. Opportunities won't come back unless the country gets trapped in an emergency situation like this.”</p>
<p>He paused and continued, “Who knows? The current government might follow in the same footsteps of the old regime because of them. What if the Jeonil Group’s secrets are revealed during the process? You know the impeachment situation last year, right?”</p>
<p>Carrie asked, “Is your purpose to investigate the corruption of the Jeonil Group? That is a totally different direction from ours.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, it’s a little different. I want to know exactly who they are. It is no longer a presumption that they have close ties to the World Awakened Association.”</p>
<p>“I can tell you something about that. You know the Bilderberg Club, right? You would.”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>Carrie stated, “Jeonil Group’s female president is one of them. This has been confirmed several times, and it is expected.”</p>
<p>Soo-Won responded, “Yes, I knew that. But the Bilderberg Club was…”</p>
<p>She interrupted him, “Do you really think that the world's political leaders and big movers and shakers in the financial industry meet up to drink wine and dance in the ballroom? Like the way they describe the club? Don’t tell me that you believe in that.”</p>
<p>Carrie paused and then continued with a bitter smile, “It is the most secret organization among the countless groups. It’s not a big deal why the public doesn’t know much about them. It’s because the power of club members is so immense that no one even dares to reveal their identities. It must be the image that you feel toward the Jeonil Group as a citizen.”</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won listened carefully to Carrie, who had a broader perspective than himself.</p>
<p>Carrie continued, “The Bilderberg Club has a long history, and the wars of modern and contemporary history had all come from them. It’s up to them to decide when to start the war, how long it will last, and when to end it. This war against alien civilization was no exception. They marked the beginning, and it ended in their hands as they predicted.”</p>
<p>“That is true…” Lee Soo-Won pursed his lips.</p>
<p>“Going through the Jeonil Group is one of several ways to approach the Bilderberg Club. And they don’t look at those who approach them with folded arms. There were incidents that I can’t bear to talk about here. The people who tried to get close to the Bilderberg Club had gone missing. In addition to controlling the media, they have no qualms about using physical force on others.”</p>
<p>This kind of secrecy was common. He didn’t need to consider global events like the OECD General Assembly, G8 meeting, WTO meeting, or World Central Bank General Assembly to think about this issue.</p>
<p>The evidence was clear in daily life. The executives of his apartment building also colluded and acted based on their own interests, determining building prices and the construction of expensive sports facilities on empty lots through their private agreements.</p>
<p>Despite this, Lee Soo-Won found it hard to accept that the same forces of control and power existed at a global level. He knew the reality, but it felt like a situation that was happening in a different dimension.</p>
<p>“Mr. Lee, the World Awakened Association is bound to have a tight connection with the Jeonil Group. However, do you think we are withdrawing back to our country because we don’t know about that?” Carrie asked.</p>
<p>She then stated, “You’d better listen to this carefully. If you are willing to continue, then you should be prepared to risk your life along with many of your friends. However, more urgent matters are happening quickly to be stuck in this issue. You should stop blinding yourself. There is a log of cases we should pay attention to, Mr. Lee.”</p>
<p>Buzz. Buzzzz-</p>
<p>Even then, Lee Soo-Won’s phone was vibrating. As he was acquainted with many people while working as a reporter, there were so many funerals to attend. The amount of condolence money he had to give already exceeded his monthly salary. One of his nephews had also died.</p>
<p>He was still a kid.</p>
<p>Anyway, Lee Soo-Won was unable to stop Carrie from exiting the vehicle. The work related to the Jeonil Group posed a serious risk to one’s life, and it was clear that he would face isolation if he pursued the matter related to the mysterious Jeonil Club.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>He was already in front of the funeral hall, which was located near Gimpo International Airport. It was quite far from his home. He held a cigarette in his mouth as he looked up at the red light of the international flight, flying away in the night sky.</p>
<p>Some of those who had entered the Jeonil Resort must have been on that plane. According to records that were not yet deleted by the immigration office, there were significant numbers of people who entered Korea the day before the Day of Advent. After all, the families of Joshua von Karjan, Jonathan Hunter, and other important figures entered the resort. The Group had guaranteed their safety.</p>
<p>At first, Lee Soo-Won wondered why Jeonil had installed a huge barrier around the luxury resort, but he now realized that they had a valid reason to endure public criticism.</p>
<p>Jeonil Group… Everything was happening in our country.</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won regretted not finding out sooner. When everyone’s attention was drawn to the relationship between the current regime and North America and nuclear issues in North Korea, he should have changed his perspective and tried to reveal the whole story of the great event.</p>
<p>The president of the World Awakened Association was Korean, and he was the chairman of the Ilsung Group. Among the few directors, there was one more Korean guy named Kwon Seong-Il. There were two Koreans in charge of the association, and they stood shoulder to shoulder with world-class superpowers such as Jonathan Hunter and Joshua von Karjan.</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won walked back into the funeral hall. The funeral home was busy. The fact that three hundred thousand people had entered and only five hundred returned made the number of returnees meaningless.</p>
<p>It was difficult to book a burial service as almost three hundred thousand had died overnight. Only those with money and connection succeeded in reserving a spot.</p>
<p>Lots of wreaths filled the first floor. In the meantime, Lee Soo-Won was drawn to the direction where mourners were looking at. People made more fuss about the wreath than the garlands that the high-ranking government officials had sent.</p>
<p>「 Rest in peace. Director of the World Awakened Association, Kwon Seong-Il. 」</p>
<p>Huh?!</p>
<p>The title ‘Caliber’ disgraced his identity, but Kwon Seong-Il was indeed the most notable name in the world right now. Kwon Seong-Il!</p>
<p>However, the wreath had been delivered to his nephew. The deceased’s name was Kang Ja-Seong, and the chief mourner was Soo-Won’s maternal uncle.</p>
<p>This is it!</p>
<p>It didn’t appear that other reporters had figured this out yet. If so, then they would have swarmed around here. It meant that he shouldn’t have been busy chasing the other Awakened whom he couldn’t even talk to.</p>
<p>Lee Soo-Won lit incense and said after bowing back to the chief mourner, “This is so heartbreaking.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seong-Il phoned me.</p>
<p>Compared to what would happen in the future, Seong-Il’s problem was just a minnow in the ocean. In fact, I didn’t give freedom just to Seong-Il. Some Awakened were still staying at the Gwacheon Hotel like Yeon-Hee and me, but many had already left.</p>
<p>I only asked them to stay quiet without causing any trouble until the association was completed. The urgent issue wasn’t derived from Awakened who left to seek a new life in Korea. They were just inevitable measles at the junction of old and new eras. The real problem was still in the talk on the television.</p>
<p>“While the World Awakened Association urges Awakened around the world to wait ‘calmly’ until the registration date of the Awakened, they expressed deep regret and warning to countries who attempt to control their Awakened, including China.”</p>
<p>The announcer continued, “Also, the global financial group, Jonathan Investment Finance Group, has spent a massive one trillion dollars on the World Awakened Association. The funds were intended for the benefit of Awakened individuals who played a role in saving humanity and the families of those who lost loved ones. The Awakened will soon be able to receive debit cards with two hundred thousand dollars worth of funds through SOBs[4] and partner bank branches around the world at any time. Ten thousand dollars worth of consolation money will be given to the forty-five million victims’ families.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee asked as she indulged in some ice cream, “What are you going to do with China?”</p>
<p>When I opened my mouth, the sweetness from Yeon-Hee’s spoon filled my mouth. She gazed at me affectionately as I rested on her lap.</p>
<p>My goal was to bring China under control and ensure their cooperation with the club’s future endeavors. This would demonstrate that their belief in the club’s limited influence was misguided. I had to show them that our true power lay not in physical might.</p>
<p>“In the 1990s, the United States killed Iraq.”</p>
<p>I opened my mouth to eat more of the ice cream that was going into my mouth and added, “We will impose the highest level of economic sanctions on China.”</p>

The government caught everyone who disagreed with them and ordered the Central Intelligence Agency to torture them. Many of them died during the torture, and some of them were innocent college students who weren’t involved in the protests. ☜</p>

<p>Chapter 327</p>
<p>I moved to Jeonil Hotel in Seoul for a more luxurious and varied break as the curfew in Gwacheon limited my options for a fulfilling rest.</p>
<p>Today’s menu was Western food. We were no longer in a hurry when dealing with food as if we were being chased by demons. I ate while looking outside the window and enjoyed the scenery of Seoul that I had longed for. Yeon-Hee was also looking in the same direction as she tore the inside of the baguette.</p>
<p>She muttered, “I should be careful from now on. I’m on… that…”</p>
<p>She wasn’t even ashamed to be naked in front of me, but she acted like a girl in puberty who just started her period. Anyway, her magic[1] of the month began. It was a real magic that only biological women could have, and this meant that Awakened could get pregnant. It was challenging to have babies now. As Yeon-Hee had mentioned, we needed to wait until the world where our childrens’ safety was guaranteed…</p>
<p>I nodded and sliced the steak. At that time, the thought came to my mind as I saw the blood flowing out of the meat with gravy.</p>
<p>Surprisingly, there were quite a lot of people addicted to monster blood. How are they dealing with that now?</p>
<p>Individuals addicted to monster blood, which gave them negative hallucinations, were often the weak. They were the ones who had desperately waited this day to come, hoping to view their civilization through illusions. I wondered if they would overcome their cravings for monster blood here since they would now be back home.</p>
<p>Thoughts spawned more thoughts, eventually leading to the notion of a reinforcing agent. Just as we could create weapons for boss monsters with mana stones, we could make reinforcing agents that would raise the limits of Awakened with monster blood in the past. They were enhanced through technology and were even used by civilians back then.</p>
<p>By now, countries around the world would have been studying monster carcasses by cutting, ripping them apart, creating useless DNA maps, storing internal organs, and preserving mana stones separately. The governments and scientists would be making frantic attempts to find the reason why the monster corps could endure the advanced firepower of mankind.</p>
<p>“What are you thinking?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>I didn’t tell her to read my mind because I witnessed how painful it was for her to open up people’s minds and read them.</p>
<p>I responded, “Reinforcing agents. Do you know about that?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee slowly nodded and shifted her gaze toward the blood that was collected on the plate like me.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where it originated from, unlike the mana stone weapons.”</p>
<p>The reinforcing agents appeared much earlier than the mana stone weapons had in the past.</p>
<p>“Can you make it?” Yeon-Hee asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “If I could, then I wouldn’t have just thought about it here. I would have started making it right away.”</p>
<p>She pointed out, “If you wait, it will eventually come to your hands.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee cut the steak elegantly. Then, she pointed at the steak, plate, and baguette with a knife one by one.</p>
<p>“Just like all of these came out of your hands. I don’t know what route it will be, but the start was always from your pocket. Right?”</p>
<p>It would happen in the end, but I couldn’t assure it since I would be selling my stocks soon.</p>
<p>The one trillion dollars released by Jonathan Investment Finance Group was not the money that was stored in the company’s warehouse. From the Day of Advent until now, they had literally poured out everything to defend against the crazy plunge in world stock prices. The cash in the warehouse had been turned into global corporate stocks and sealed in the names of numerous paper companies.</p>
<p>As a result, the flow of global capital had been strained. The reason why the exchange volume looked the same as before was that cross trading[2] was underway to hide such truth. The massive amount of fees incurred there was also circulating in my pocket, but there were funds that were bound to leak outward as this continued.</p>
<p>Pennies like that didn’t matter. The real problem was that the flow of global capital was blocked. Money was supposed to move around. Leaving all of it to me was nothing different from forcibly locking up Awakened who were all beasts. As complaints could suddenly escalate, the global economy could also experience a massive shock that would be far more devastating than the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>On that day, individuals who were left with only cash due to the massive sell-off of assets were not a small group. They were those who believed that the world would never recover stability, and these individuals had caused the greatest circulation of cash in world history.</p>
<p>If the situation was left unattended, hyperinflation[3] would take place simultaneously around the world. That was why I said the shock would be more devastating than the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>If the impact of economic sanctions imposed on China was added to that, then the gold tower that I had put a lot of effort into building so far would inevitably collapse from its foundation. Therefore, the Jonathan Investment Finance Group had no choice but to hastily sell off some of our shares and attract one trillion dollars. Kim Cheong-Soo was the one who did this as he was the one who was currently leading the Group.</p>
<p>The conclusion was this. We had to release the stakes of the global companies we were controlling to the market. It was time to recoup the world’s overflowing cash primarily to prevent hyperinflation, ease the flow of stressed capital, and make the current economy flow smoother.</p>
<p>During the process, the public may point their fingers at my companies such as Jonathan Group while being oblivious to what they had received from me. Ironically, it would appear as if we were gaining more wealth. It was because we would look like we were selling money at a higher price than the cost we bought. We would dispose of some shares, but the value of the majority we still held would begin to rise.</p>
<p>The World Awakened Association promised humanity the revival of a new era. However, I intended to give them an unprecedented financial boom before that. At the same time, I would offset the impact of economic sanctions from China.</p>
<p>“You said you should rest when you can, right? I guess the owner of the world can’t even take a break properly.”</p>
<p>When I took out the laptop, Yeon-Hee smiled at me.</p>
<p>“Then, I’ll take some of your food.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation was urgent. There were too many signs of danger in the market to wait for his approval. There was no call from CEO Jonathan either. He couldn’t let things down as the group had put in lots of effort into defending on the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>In fact, Kim Cheong-Soo had done this in his position as the CFO[4] of Jonathan Group. The world was still riding a cockhorse with the joy of victory, but the battle that the group was fighting wasn’t over yet. Thus, he was forced to see a one trillion stake from countries and corporations with large pension funds. All they had was cash. Some of them even begged to buy shares at prices much higher than what Kim Cheong-Soo demanded.</p>
<p>Lubricating the global economy with a trillion-dollar oil posed no difficulties. Trades that normally took months were signed by express in one day.</p>
<p>One of Kim Cheong-Soo’s subordinates suddenly opened his office door and shouted in excitement, “Things are going good even by a little bit. The global stock prices are starting to go up!”</p>
<p>“I’m watching it.”</p>
<p>However, Kim Cheong-Soo couldn’t be as relieved as the guy who had reported it. The employee grasped the heavy atmosphere in the office. He was the chief trader of Jonathan Investment Finance Group and also directly under Kim Cheong-Soo.</p>
<p>“Umm… Is this transaction not approved by the higher-ups?” he asked timidly.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo shook his head. “No.”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo reassured him, “I will take all the responsibility, so please keep your eyes on the market. We just barely stepped on a small fire.”</p>
<p>The reporter was unable to confess to completing his task. The deal was worth a trillion dollars, equivalent to nearly the GDP of Kim Cheong-Soo’s home country when converted to its currency. This was the biggest deal that would make a mark in financial history, regardless of how many assets the entire group had.</p>
<p>And the CFO just carried this out without the approval of the higher-ups?</p>
<p>The man who reported thought that the CFO’s accomplishment would be futile if it resulted in negative consequences.</p>
<p>“I will transfer the sale assets to the World Awakened Association. Please send a letter of cooperation to Washington D.C. You can contact this number about the use of funds.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo’s words sounded like a will to the reporter. Then, he left after carefully closing the door.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo had never been in his accommodation since the Day of Advent, but the night felt especially too long. He was regretting it a bit. One of the leading players in the world was himself. He had been the protagonist of all kinds of adventures and hero stories since the owner had scouted him when he was wandering Wall Street as a nobody.</p>
<p>Such a life was coming to an end.</p>
<p>What was the point of having so much money? What is the point of living a royal life in the Bahamas?</p>
<p>Humans were animals that fed on the respect and honor of the public. It was difficult for Kim Cheong-Soo to think about his life without his[5] order. As a person who had already moved the world under him, Kim Cheong-Soo thought he was too young to be buried in the wilderness.</p>
<p>The new era had begun. Humanity would move on again, as always, toward an alien civilization that would have been dismissed as daydreaming before. The great stories of what new materials and resources those civilizations had, and how they impacted our global economy wouldn’t be recorded in history.</p>
<p>The next day, Kim Cheong-Soo was staring at the monitor while rubbing his eyes with the back of his hand. He had received an email. There was only one person, other than his family, in the world who called him by his Korean name instead of Brian Kim or the CFO of Jonathan Group. The email had been sent from him, and Kim Cheong-Soo thought it would inform him about his death from this society.</p>
<p>However, the first sentence began like this.</p>
<p>「 It was an amazing move, Kim Cheong-Soo. The transfer of one trillion dollars to the association was also a great idea. 」</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo’s entire body trembled. He realized his authority and indescribable excitement arose with a shudder.</p>
<p>「 I hope you still have enough energy to work more. The details are attached to this email. 」</p>
<p>There were three attached files. One was the conditions to be prioritized in liquidating shares in the future, and the other was specific instructions on imposing economic sanctions against China. He printed the last one, put it in his pocket, then transferred the previous two pieces of data to his smartphone.</p>
<p>Then, he yelled outside, “Get the car ready! We are going to Washington D.C. now!”</p>

<p>Chapter 328</p>
<p>“So are you saying that you won’t pay any tax on the one trillion dollars?”</p>
<p>The expected tax revenue alone was close to national defense expenditure, and he was saying that he would blow that up.</p>
<p>The U.S. President was livid with his advisors even though he had personally hired them. Many of them had been swayed by Jeonil’s forces, and even those not yet fully in their grasp would respond with eager obedience, rushing to their side like a loyal dog at the mere hint of a gesture.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, he had no choice but to tolerate it when he entered the White House two years ago as he couldn’t manage state affairs if he solely focused on the club. The servants of the club and all the fake media had continued attacking him even after the presidential election was over.</p>
<p>That was why he couldn’t avoid using social media. Even if the social media companies were under Jeonil’s control, they were unable to prevent him from publishing his posts and telling the truth to the public as opposed to the false and distorted version of events. If he could, then he wanted to write this on his account right away.</p>
<p>When these people stay together, you are all their slaves. There is no democracy as we still live in feudalism. That’s the real world you don’t know.</p>
<p>A new era? That’s hilarious. Hahaha. They are more terrifying than alien monsters. It’s not just the hideous teeth they have. They can trample and kill you immediately only with money.</p>
<p>However, there is nothing to worry about. Why? Because why would they kill slaves, which are also their property? So don’t worry. Our world has finally found peace.</p>
<p>Then, one of his aides spoke strongly and firmly, “The private companies are going to replace what our government is responsible for. If we stop them, their burden will come to us.”</p>
<p>Another chimed in, “The Awakened are incredibly ferocious and uncontrollable. If we don’t guarantee them a pleasant life, then they will turn into a bunch of swarming locusts.”</p>
<p>He snapped, “So we should give two hundred thousand dollars to each person? Wow, it’s such an easy way to make money.”</p>
<p>“The money isn’t only from our administration. Through Jonathan Investment Finance Group, the World Awakened Association has…”</p>
<p>He interrupted the aide, “Isn’t that an excuse for them to disperse their capital?”</p>
<p>The aide refuted, “No, SOBs and partner banks are already working on this. Mr. President, we only need your approval.”</p>
<p>The U.S. President realized that his role was now limited to signing documents and lamented at how powerless he was. This wasn’t why he had struggled to defeat the old lady during the presidential election.</p>
<p>Looking back, there was only one reason why he could rebel against the club. It was the dear public, the ones who looked at his posts on social media.</p>
<p>Look. Despite the club’s evil leader and their support toward the old lady, I was elected thanks to the public.</p>
<p>He initially considered the Korean President as a comrade, but that guy eventually submitted to the influence of the club, just like everyone else. Such was the strength of the club.</p>
<p>The aide urged, “Please approve it, Mr. President.”</p>
<p>The U.S. President glared at the document in front of him and at the person who placed it there. There were many who weren’t aware of the club, so he couldn’t directly mention it.</p>
<p>However, this happened all the time, even at the beginning of his term. He had once brought the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff[1] to end North Korea, which was a thorn in the United States’ side. He instructed him to strike the Little Rocket Man[2] and their lands first. However, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff rejected his supreme order.</p>
<p>It was not only that. A more absurd thing occurred when he asked a guy in charge to scrap the unreasonable FTA[3]. The man, who couldn’t even ask to join the club, took all the related documents from his desk and ran away.</p>
<p>Things were the same when he tried withdrawing U.S. troops from South Korea as it was expensive to manage them. The government didn’t follow the direction of the U.S. President, and, by the time he came back to his senses, the nation had already entered a state of reconciliation with the Little Rocket Man by using economic sanctions against them as a whip.</p>
<p>It had always been this way.</p>
<p>Everything is fucked up.</p>
<p>The more egregious thing was that the club and the World Awakened Association were inseparable. The club even had practical force. These soldiers were gifted with exceptional powers that were only seen in comic books. They were merciless killers, devoid of any emotion.</p>
<p>The U.S. President eased the tension in his eyes, then signed a document approving a one trillion dollar emergency rule with tax exemptions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Brian Kim is here.”</p>
<p>It was pitch black outside and the time was 2 AM. Even after the official business of state affairs was finished, the club dispatched one of its members, indicating their complete control and dominance over them.</p>
<p>The U.S. President’s thick eyebrows wriggled. Then, he shouted out loud, and his kids, who were deeply asleep, started waking up. His last ego was not inviting any club members to the family table. The White House office was usually closed after opening hours, but he intentionally insisted on welcoming Brian Kim into the Oval Office.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo said after the U.S. President entered the room, “I won’t tell you again. We want the U.S. to take the lead in imposing economic sanctions on China. Immediately after the sun rises.”</p>
<p>“Do members in the club not sleep?” the president sardonically asked.</p>
<p>The U.S. President referred to Kim Cheong-Soo as a club member, and he also took it for granted.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo replied, “The sanctions on the Chinese economy are the club’s determination.”</p>
<p>“I assume the club meeting hasn’t taken place yet. I guess it was only you who made the decision,” the president growled.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo shrugged. “You really know nothing about the club. This isn’t a matter of whether you believe it or not. Our club has decided to impose strong economic sanctions on China.”</p>
<p>“Then, let’s hear about it. How powerful is it?”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo explained, “No import or export of all products, including crude oil. Prohibition of direct flights to the United States and its allies. At the moment, we are taking those two bans as our first step.”</p>
<p>The U.S. President burst into a peal of laughter. “Hahahaha!”</p>
<p>He laughed his head off for a long time. It was a totally different story from the trade war against China, which had been underway before the Day of Advent. The tariff increases on a few items were a minor inconvenience in comparison to the economic sanctions that Brian Kim spoke of. The club was essentially guiding the U.S. into a proxy war against China. The damage would be entirely up to the U.S.</p>
<p>“You were the ones who claimed to be ushering in a new era. I can’t believe it has turned out to be hell. Tell all of your club members clearly. This time, you will have to impeach me,” the President raised his voice.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo asked, “Why would we impeach you? You are doing much better than our other candidates.”</p>
<p>The President was about to say something bitter but stopped. Instead, he made a resolution. “I will never open the door to hell with my hands. Never. I can’t hurt my citizens.”</p>
<p>“Why are you thinking so negatively?”</p>
<p>“What does the club gain from collapsing China and the United States?” the president asked.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soon smiled. “Oh, you are talking about that. Mr. President, nothing that you are concerned about would happen. I only said it would be under the leadership of the U.S. There will be others, too. The same economic sanctions will be imposed on China in countries around the world except for China. Oh, except those countries that are trying to control the Awakened.”</p>
<p>The president narrowed his eyes. “Countries around the world?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Mr. President. Also, there’s something that Odin wanted to tell you. It’s too late, but congratulations for…”</p>
<p>“Wait. Wait a second. Let’s slow down a bit.”</p>
<p>The U.S. President blinked quickly.</p>
<p>Odin is the head of the Awakened. Although the club is closely related to the World Awakened Association…</p>
<p>Then, Kim Cheong-Soo took out the invitation letter from his arms. The final attachment in Odin’s email to him was this letter.</p>
<p>「Date and time: April 1st, 2018.</p>
<p>Location: Westfields Marriott Hotel, Virginia, United States.</p>
<p>Host: Jeonil Club 」</p>
<p>When the U.S. President read the letter, his entire body froze instantly. It was printed on a common A4 paper, but it felt like a brilliant light was emanating from there to him. This was the moment that he had been waiting for. The club was finally reaching out to him!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The former presidents were the club’s outputs. In other words, they were the club’s slaves from birth.</p>
<p>However, he was different. He had entered the White House on his own and won the current position by himself. But that didn’t matter as all the claims that he was the most powerful person in the world were nonsense!</p>
<p>The truth was hidden behind the scenes. It was before he entered the White House around 1986 that he realized that. He faintly felt the presence of the club when he was ranked as the twenty-sixth wealthiest man in the world by Forbes. They were real.</p>
<p>He had longed for Manhattan and Hollywood since he was a child, and it was the peak of his success when he conquered those places. Therefore, he was stunned by the existence of the heavenly realm. There were people looking down at the lower world from the sky. It was since then that he had been desperate to get an invitation from them.</p>
<p>Also, that might have been the reason why his 1990s were pitch dark. He needed more success to catch the club’s attention. He became greedy and enjoyed adventures, but as the world entered an unexpected recession, his adventures went bankrupt one after another. Then in the end, he joined the fucking Reform Party and considered running for president to grab the club’s eyes. However, that made his pockets go empty.</p>
<p>It felt like the day of being fully incorporated into the real world appeared to be distant and elusive, but he steeled himself. He didn’t mind taking any jobs from the construction industry to damn broadcasting jobs.</p>
<p>Everyone laughed at him when he said he was running to become the forty-fifth president, and even the club backed the old lady. He put her nose out to show the club how competent he was. He had once doubted the influence of the club, but soon he came to the understanding that the title of president held little significance.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of his term, the government administration did everything as they wanted. At the same time, the club didn’t reach out to him. That lasted for thirty years. He waited for them to give him a chance for those years…</p>
<p>He looked at the invitation and became emotional. Tears welled up in his eyes. It was after that he suddenly found something strange in the letter.</p>
<p>“But the club’s name is…” he muttered.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo stated, “You must not know yet, but that’s okay. The Bilderberg Club disbanded a long time ago. We used it as our predecessor but established this club under one person’s system.”</p>
<p>The President stiffened, including his eyes.</p>
<p>“Just one person?” he asked quietly.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soons smiled. “It’s Odin. He is known as the leader of the Awakened. It’s late, but he would like to congratulate you for winning the election. He also knows that you have faithfully fulfilled the club’s instructions so far.”</p>
<p>“He is…” he stuttered.</p>
<p>“You will be able to meet him at the next meeting. If you achieve success in economic sanctions on China by then, he will be pleased. He has high expectations for you, so start working on it as soon as possible. None of the world’s leaders will be able to go against your order.”</p>
<p>The U.S. President knew what kind of power was in this invitation! China was really screwed. They had no choice but to die after struggling alone against the entire world.</p>
<p>He picked up the invitation letter with a trembling hand. It was the moment when he took his first step into the real world. To the greater world.</p>
<p>1. highest-ranking and most senior military officer in the United States Armed Forces and the principal military advisor to the president, the National Security Council] the Homeland Security Council, and the secretary of defense ☜</p>
<p>2. It is a nickname that refers to North Korean leader Kim Jong-Un. It was a derogatory reference to Kim’s development of North Korea’s ballistic missile program. ☜</p>
<p>3. Free Trade Agreement. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 329</p>
<p>No one could deny that the club was being operated by a socialist monopoly. After all, it was a socialist idea to monopolize and control everything behind the scenes, but there was no spot in the club for China, which had become socialist.</p>
<p>Why did Asia have a financial crisis in 1997? Why was China been consistently kept in check by others? Why was Korea, which was called the dragon and tiger of Asia and the mainstream of the global economy, targeted? Why did the powerful Japanese economy, which was seeking global hegemony, begin to decline?</p>
<p>It was because the club had been born in the West. They were destined to be the world’s rulers and needed to consolidate their dominance. The same thing was true for the current Jeonil Club, which had the former Bilderberg club as its predecessor.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that China would respond similarly to the U.S. President, even if the club extended invitations now. Describing the relationship between the club and China as ‘water and oil’ was a simplistic and accurate characterization.</p>
<p>After China had ended its emergence and entered the development stage, it had become a huge and important pillar of the global economy. They likely felt proud of themselves and wanted to confront the club, which could be the reason for their reckless action despite the World Awakened Association’s suggestions.</p>
<p>China, of course, knew the connection between the association and the club. Jonathan was the King of Hell and Joshua was Osiris. However, they were confident that they wouldn’t die alone if that happened. Or they may have assumed that even if they lost flesh, their bones would remain intact.</p>
<p>I wasn’t talking about nuclear weapons. Indeed, China had a secret weapon that could launch an attack that was as powerful as a nuclear strike on the entire world. Even Kim Cheong-Soo himself wouldn’t have known about this. If he had, then he would have argued with me.</p>
<p>Anyway, people often said that a rat could bite a cat if it was in a predicament. That was why I bought a flight ticket to London so that I could stop China from launching the worst bomb on Earth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation at Incheon Airport was better. In advanced countries, they were on emergency alert in case the Awakened used an aircraft. The association announced in the media that the date of registration of the Awakened would be May 1st, and we still had one month left.</p>
<p>Until then, the world’s airports had no choice but to be tense. Although Korea had fewer than five hundred Awakened, the government put up notification posters at Incheon Airport on televisions, radios, and computers. They felt that simply turning on the loudspeaker was not enough.</p>
<p>「 We invite our esteemed Awakened to join us on the date specified below.</p>
<p>Date: May 1st, 2018</p>
<p>Location: Korean headquarters of the World Awakened Association.</p>
<p>(Please refer to the map) 」</p>
<p>There was no big reason why I didn’t destroy the gate on the other side of the globe by using the Doom Man’s power. I was even careful when breathing, as I was afraid that one breath could cause Doom Kaos to send another command. If it had a functioning brain, then it would understand the need to wait until the connection was completely established.</p>
<p>This was my first time sitting in first class upon my return home. The first-class seats were usually unoccupied, but due to the current circumstances, there were many British returning to their homeland, making this part of the plane more populated. Also, most of them were looking at their laptops on their tables. The noise filling the cabin came from there.</p>
<p>The woman seated beside me was thoroughly engrossed in her monitor. She appeared to be oblivious to the flight attendant’s announcements. With multiple windows open on her screen, her messenger alone seemed overwhelming to her.</p>
<p>I thought she would be an entrepreneur like other passengers, but she worked in the media industry. A logo of the Guardian, an esteemed British newspaper, was embroidered on the bag that she had thrown on the ground in a hurry. Yes, it was one of the media companies that was somewhere in my pocket.</p>
<p>The first-class cabin was noisy with the sound of typing, and it was overflowing with a combative atmosphere. The flight attendants seemed to respond well to this as they had often experienced such cases lately.</p>
<p>I was the only relaxed one. I turned my head toward the window and closed my eyes.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes as I felt someone glancing at me. The plane was crossing over Chinese airspace according to the monitor attached to the seat. It had only been two to three hours since I closed my eyes.</p>
<p>The white woman next to me woke me up. Even now, chat windows were flashing on her monitor. She fully utilized the benefits of first-class, since this cabin offered the fastest airplane wifi.</p>
<p>She smiled at me. “I’m Carrie. If you don’t mind, could I talk to you for a bit?”</p>
<p>She, of course, used English.</p>
<p>“About what?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Your name is…”</p>
<p>“I’m Ethan.”</p>
<p>“You are the only one sleeping here, Ethan. Are you a Korean businessman by chance? If I’m rude, please let me know. I won’t disturb you anymore.”</p>
<p>I replied, “No, it’s okay. I was bored anyway. You seem busier than me.”</p>
<p>“This is daily life for people like us these days. To be honest, your peaceful mood grabbed my attention because most people cannot afford to even have a break these days.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that makes sense. I must look like a reader of the Guardian.”</p>
<p>The Guardian readers in the UK had a thread of connection with the left wing of Gangnam in Korea. Since the Guardian was a progressive media aimed at the middle class in England, it was the perfect type of humor for a woman working there.</p>
<p>I thought my joke was good considering the circumstances. After all, ever since I had returned home, all I had done was cause rains of blood. I planned to regain my life on Earth and not make my parents concerned about me before I saw them. Therefore, this attempt at humor was the fruit of my efforts. I still couldn’t give up on humanity even while I was taking a break with Yeon-Hee and making love to her.</p>
<p>“You must be one of our subscribers.”</p>
<p>As expected, the woman gave me a friendly smile with a look that showed that she had finished judging me.</p>
<p>I nodded and replied blithely, “I read everything. The Guardian and the Times. We are in a situation where we need as much information as possible. Problems are not limited to politics, those in the business sector are more pressing and really need resolution.”</p>
<p>It was clear why the Guardian reporter was inquiring about me despite her busy schedule. She was looking for a new source of information related to the current political situation from the perspective of Asians like me. Moreover, my high social status was evident as I was traveling first class.</p>
<p>She commented, “You must be a businessman.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, something like that. Is that the article for tomorrow’s newspaper?” I asked while glancing at her laptop. The article was obviously about China’s economic sanctions.</p>
<p>She responded immediately, “The U.S.-led economic sanctions against China are outrageous in this situation. The government will never be able to convince the public. This is a huge problem, so I was wondering if I could get any information about it from you.”</p>
<p>I stated, “The liberal nations guaranteed freedom for the Awakened, but China and other hostile countries did not. What do you think the reason is? They are considering the Awakened as military weapons.”</p>
<p>She replied, “The World Awakened Association is using ‘peace among humanity’ and ‘leap into a new era’ as their slogans. The world wouldn’t want to fall into chaos again because of a few of them. It would be reasonable to think of the matter as an inevitable sacrifice and leave things be.”</p>
<p>She paused and then continued, “I heard that there are many Chinese Awakened fleeing across the border. They may be entering South Korea by now from North Korea. The situation in North Korea is unknown due to its secretive nature, but it can be assumed that it would be like a warzone at the moment. Anyway, a group of Awakened there must be strong. In that context, is it valid to regard the Awakened that are being detained in China as weak? Wouldn’t it be illogical to call them threatening military weapons?”</p>
<p>“Is that what you think, Ms. Carrie?” I countered.</p>
<p>She shrugged. “It’s what the public thinks. That’s why people think it’s ridiculous that the world is imposing ultra-strong economic sanctions on China.”</p>
<p>I snorted. “The public doesn’t think that deeply.”</p>
<p>“Our readers are thoughtful people like you, Ethan. The public is the same to me. As a reader of the Guardian newspaper, how do you view China’s economic sanctions from the United States?”</p>
<p>“Not as an Asian, but as a reader of the Guardian?” I asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>“I hope the U.S. wins since they started it,” I answered.</p>
<p>“Even though it is a pyrrhic victory?” she probed.</p>
<p>I smiled slightly. “I should have told you earlier, but I work for Jonathan Investment Finance Group.”</p>
<p>The woman raised her thin eyebrows. It wasn’t just her, but all the passengers who were listening to our conversation began buzzing. There were thousands of people directly involved in the Jonathan Group, but there were only a few who could travel first class.</p>
<p>“I am confident that we will win again this time,” I stated confidently.</p>
<p>She narrowed her eyes slightly. “What kind of victory do you mean?”</p>
<p>“A victory such that the world won’t be impacted by China’s economic sanction. Of course, there will be a war of attrition. But we protected our global market even on the Day of Advent. As for China? They are nothing compared to that. They would have to be prepared for this.”</p>
<p>“Can I consider this as confirmation that Jonathan Group is involved in this situation? Then, does that mean it will spread to a financial war?” she asked.</p>
<p>I shrugged. “What are you going to do if I’m faking it? Just write it down as an anonymous source. This is not the official position of our group, anyway. It’s just my personal opinion as a businessman.”</p>
<p>“Let me summarize all this. It was shocking that an alien civilization invaded our human race, but how the entire world is agreeing with the U.S. to impose economic sanctions on China is also something we never imagined. China isn’t Iraq in the 90s. They have an enormous influence on the world’s economy, industry, and financial sectors, and they are competing against the U.S. over supremacy.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “That is true, but I’d like to tell you something.”</p>
<p>The woman leaned over.</p>
<p>I said, “This is not a secret. It was proven that those capital forces, including our group, that kept the resistance up on the Day of Advent, made the right decision. Monsters were completely defeated by the returned Awakened. Thanks to them, we restored peace, but the global financial markets have been completely blocked.”</p>
<p>“Yes, they are strained.” She nodded thoughtfully.</p>
<p>I explained, “It was because the stakes of companies around the world were monopolized by such a small number of capital forces. It was an unprecedented situation regardless of their noble purposes.”</p>
<p>“There might be some disagreement regarding their purpose being ‘noble,’ but… please continue.”</p>
<p>I continued, “Those who sold their assets on the Day of Advent must have regretted their actions. It could be a huge capital force, or it could be anyone who’s on board here. Everyone was so terrified at the moment. Thus, ordinary investors had no choice but to dispose of their assets as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>She conceded, “That’s true.”</p>
<p>“But what happened after that? They must now regret selling and are eagerly awaiting a chance to buy it back, as they wait for the capital forces to put their shares back on the market. They must be tearing their hair out and desperately looking at the market. They are probably frustrated and hoping to regain what they lost by selling at a low price.”</p>
<p>Only my voice filled the air in the first class.</p>
<p>“Did you see the global stock market rebound slightly yesterday?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Yes, of course. Jonathan Investment Finance Group did a big deal.”</p>
<p>“What you witnessed yesterday was the outcome of a major transaction, as some ownership shares have become available and spread globally.”</p>
<p>“You are talking about Jonathan and the Gillians, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. “Yes, but that’s only a fraction of what’s in their pockets, and they are not fools. They are the best strategists and owners of world capital. They wouldn’t just watch their assets dry up in their pockets. Yesterday’s trillion-dollar deal is clear evidence.”</p>
<p>I added, “Everyone who seceded from the market is hungry. They only wish for the stake to be released. Here’s the conclusion, Carrie.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I smiled slyly. “What blows up your mind more? The impact of the sanctions on China, or the stocks that have just begun to roam around the world? I’m not saying this with confidence only because I’m from the Jonathan Group. I personally see more money on the latter.”</p>
<p>I turned toward the eyes that were focused on me and spoke as if I ordered them.</p>
<p>“A lot of shares will start to be released soon. The worst concern is gone. Therefore, it will be easy for even a child to predict the dramatic rise in share prices. So hurry up, everyone. Invest in stocks. A boom that is unprecedented in financial history will begin soon. If I were you, I would go all in.”</p>
<p>After my last word, the cabin became noisy again with the sound of typing.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 330</p>
<p>When I arrived, I noticed that the UK’s immigration process was strengthened. I was using my Ethan identity, and Ethan was a real person, who had an actual passport and a social security number in the United States. I explained that I was visiting for a business trip and showed them the gold business card with the logo of the Jonathan Investment Finance Group.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I was detained by the immigration officer and was not allowed to leave. That was why it took a while for me to finally meet the immigration inspector.</p>
<p>The woman from the Guardian had completed her immigration process before me, so she was waiting for me.</p>
<p>When I finally passed through the immigration…</p>
<p>She greeted me instantly, “Thank you for giving me your opinions, Ethan.”</p>
<p>She handed over her business card and appeared to expect me to give her one, but I hesitated and looked uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“I have one last thing I want to hear from you. Will that be okay?” the woman asked, keeping a wary eye on the heavily armed airport security personnel patrolling the area. She then said in hushed tones, “There was an act of terrorism in Westminster.”</p>
<p>People in the U.S. referred to the White House as Washington, whereas the British called Buckingham Palace as Westminster.</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>I had enough time to answer her. The woman started to search for a secluded spot after giving me a glance indicating for me to follow. The restaurant she entered reminded me of the one at Gimpo Airport, where I had first met Jonathan in person. Similar to that place, this restaurant appeared to be going out of business soon due to its poor management, lousy food, and inadequate service.</p>
<p>She sat down and said, “I sent today’s article to the editorial department. Mmm… It will be updated in an hour. Of course, I didn’t include your name.”</p>
<p>The Guardian was indeed a media company focusing on online business, and it was quick at handling things. Although its progressive tendency was very noticeable, it operated a site with the third-largest number of visitors in the world. Kim Cheong-Soo now had less work to do just because I happened to sit next to Carrie on the plane.</p>
<p>“This coffee is the payment for the interview as we are both quite busy at the moment. I will treat you to dinner next time. We can follow each other on social media, right?”</p>
<p>She was boldly requesting a dinner date while leaning her upper body against mine. I noticed that she applied a fresh layer of makeup when she went to the restroom earlier.</p>
<p>I gently pushed her away. “I have a serious girlfriend who I’m planning on getting married to. It’s not because you are not attractive.”</p>
<p>Upon realizing that those words came out of my mouth effortlessly, it seemed as if the blood from the Stage of Advent had vanished within me. It was a good sign. However, the act of terrorism at the Buckingham Palace may have been sparked by the Awakened, and the stench of the Stage of Advent could be permeating the air there.</p>
<p>She easily backed off and smiled slightly. “Congratulations to both of you.”</p>
<p>The woman continued as if it wasn’t a big deal. “Then, I’ll tell you the rest. The act of terror at Buckingham Palace… was caused by the Awakened. But we’ve found out that the person who put a stop to it was another Awakened who belongs to the royal family. Of course, it won’t be on the news.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you can tell me this?” I asked curiously.</p>
<p>She nodded. “I don’t think you will post it on social media. We don’t have much time, so I’ll ask directly. How much do you think the Awakened will disturb the financial world in the future?”</p>
<p>I smiled slightly. “As you know, our group’s CEO is also an Awakened.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. I heard that he is called the King of Hell among the Awakened. It’s the quickest way to create an image, but it’s awkward. Odin… Osiris… They all have great titles named after gods. Are they trying to deify themselves?” she asked.</p>
<p>My lips quirked. “You will figure out why they have names like that. No data has been disclosed, so making hasty judgments is unwise. Nevertheless, apart from that issue, I don’t expect significant changes in the business world due to the Awakened. There is enough power concentrated in the World Awakened Association. You must know well that a knife isn’t the only thing they have.”</p>
<p>The woman lifted a cup of coffee with a smile. She was waiting for my response.</p>
<p>I continued, “You should never forget that Jonathan Hunter and Joshua von Karjan have a firm grip on the banking business.”</p>
<p>She shrugged slightly. “Anything can change in twenty years. Look. Although it has been a few days, no one else has revealed themselves besides Chairman Lee.”</p>
<p>I said, “I heard that the Stage of Advent was a place where survival was a struggle and the law of the jungle ruled. Physical power was the ultimate authority, and those who were Awakened sought and acted upon the power. Of course, we still don’t know how far their supernatural powers go, but I’m certain about this. Let’s just look at Jonathan, our CEO. What do you think his real power is in this world?”</p>
<p>“...” She was clearly thinking hard.</p>
<p>I continued, “Supernatural power? No. With his vast wealth, holdings in global stocks and bonds acquired to safeguard against the Day of Advent, as well the derivatives from there, he can destroy human civilization with a single word.”</p>
<p>She quipped, “That’s such a self-mocking and aggressive statement as an employee of the group.”</p>
<p>I grinned. “We can’t hide it no matter how much we try these days. If the group divests its holdings now, CEO Jonathan’s financial influence will only become stronger. We won’t clean up all the shares. Instead, we will maintain the positions of the largest and major shareholders so they can remain actively involved in the company. If the influence on global companies stays the same, and if you accumulate an unimaginable amount of cash on top of that, any supernatural ability will fall short of that money.”</p>
<p>Then, the woman clapped silently before asking, “You think Jonathan and Joshua will appear in the public soon?”</p>
<p>I replied, “And they won’t just sit and watch the Awakened try to make changes in the financial industry. That is why I said that they will create an unprecedented boom. It’s like killing two birds with one stone. If you leave your holdings unattended, they will rot, so let’s sell them and increase their value. That’s their logic. So simple and easy to understand, Carrie.”</p>
<p>“There is one thing you are missing, Ethan.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“You forgot Odin, the former head of the Awakened. The one that Chairman Lee Tae-Han serves.”</p>
<p>Then, she stopped talking and became lost in thought. She looked around the empty restaurant and moved next to me.</p>
<p>She whispered in my ear, “Have you heard about the Bilderberg Club?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I heard they exist, but they are so secretive.”</p>
<p>She continued in hushed tones, “They are real, Ethan. If Odin is not a part of the club, then the Bilderberg Club might be split in half. Then, the war with China, whether it’s an economic or currency war, will become unpredictable.”</p>
<p>I answered, “But you still managed to submit the article.”</p>
<p>“Because I can’t put the name of the club in the article. They are frightening.”</p>
<p>The woman deliberately said that in a mischievous way, but her face that was reflected in the coffee cup was slightly stiff.</p>
<p>“But regardless of the truth, readers will love it.”</p>
<p>“That’s it. Who would refuse the money right in front of them?”</p>
<p>She sighed. “I took a bit of risk as you gave me your honest opinion. Don’t be too confident though, Ethan. Until Odin’s relationship with the Bilderberg is revealed.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “If this is all true, do you think we will be able to find out whether they are connected or not?”</p>
<p>“For some reason, I feel like you will be able to figure that out one day. I always have a good hunch.”</p>
<p>The woman asked as if it was the last time, “Are you not going to give me your business card? Really?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gillian appeared to have aged significantly even though he had not undergone the Stage of Advent. He looked as if he had lived through many years. He was waiting for me from the lobby of the Rothschild’s secret salon.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, he seemed to be struggling with finding the right words to say to me, given the fact that I had spent many years in a vastly different space-time. Therefore, I broke the silence first, “How are things going?”</p>
<p>He grimaced. “Rothschild was unable to attend. There was a disturbance in which the head had no choice but to step up himself.”</p>
<p>“Is it because of the Awakened?” I asked.</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“What about Russia?”</p>
<p>“They have been waiting for you for a few hours. They also had a bodyguard who seemed to be an Awakened.”</p>
<p>We moved to another secret room before entering the room where they were.</p>
<p>“Do you know why I called in Russia and the golden cartels?” I asked.</p>
<p>Gillian knew the exact answer, “Do you think China will attack the dollar?”</p>
<p>I countered, “What about you?”</p>
<p>He grimaced, “My wife and I are confident that they will.”</p>
<p>“I think so too. They understand that they can’t beat us, so they are trying to make it a tie.”</p>
<p>Gillian placed the data that he had hurriedly prepared on the table.</p>
<p>The information comprised China’s annual trade surplus balance and their gold holdings prior to the Day of Advent. As per the People’s Bank of China’s announcement regarding eighteen hundred tons of gold, China was not listed among the top five nations with the largest gold reserve holdings.</p>
<p>However, no one in the financial community believed that claim to be real. China had not only expanded their arms by competing for supremacy against the U.S., but they had also opened up their market and quickly became a leading capitalistic power.</p>
<p>They were obsessed with gold, so after grasping the rules, they became more active under the leadership of the people’s government. Upon witnessing Russia’s failure to launch a single one of their thousands of nuclear missiles and their downfall from a few financial assaults, they certainly became aware of something. They opened the market and poured the majority of their trade surplus into gold.</p>
<p>Moreover, all the data tracking gold spots had been concentrated on China since the Stage of Advent. Nothing much was happening in the global stock market, but international gold prices were soaring. The rich and elite would like it to be that simple, but they couldn’t just enjoy it because if the international gold price went up above the limit… If the international gold prices go even crazier under the leadership of China, then the dollar would be impacted.</p>
<p>The term ‘impact’ wasn’t enough to capture the true implications because it would basically collapse the dollar, the world’s key currency. No matter how many dollars I could force the Federal Reserve to produce, the more they made, the more the value of the dollar would plunge and flow in the direction that China wanted. The total destruction of the dollar and the sinking of the global economy, including China, couldn’t be recovered with my pockets alone.</p>
<p>That was the meaning behind the world’s key currency. The world economy was connected from one to ten, and we now lived in such an era. This was the period that I wanted to protect from the attack of the Seven Demon Kings.</p>
<p>Gillian looked serious as he pondered the future. It was a future in which China became frenzied and detonated bombs that were more destructive than nuclear weapons all over the world.</p>
<p>The woman working for Guardian and the general public believed that the countries that had severed ties with China would greatly suffer due to the systems that relied on China. Such a problem was ridiculously trivial compared to the future that Gillian and I were concerned about.</p>
<p>However, did China start everything, not knowing the worst-case scenario?</p>
<p>No, and that was why I was here. I called Russia and the elites to discuss this. I continued the conversation with Gillian over this issue. Although he didn’t risk his life to put out an urgent fire like Kim Cheong-Soo, the insight that he and his wife had was truly amazing as they understood my intentions and had prepared the related data in advance.</p>
<p>I slowly got up because I couldn’t keep the guests waiting too long. I opened the room where they were gathered and entered. Other than Rothschild, who was unable to attend, the representatives of the other elites and the executive secretary of the Kremlin in Russia stopped their conversation and stood up immediately.</p>
<p>The first one to kneel down to me was the Awakened. Although his attire was messy with multiple modern and medieval-looking items, he gave off a vibe of someone from the diamond section. It only had been a few days since we had come home from the Stage of Advent. His eyes were still filled with fear from the fearful moments that had unfolded on the stage, and it seemed like his eyes were screaming at me.</p>
<p>“I… I, I see you… O… Odin…” he stuttered.</p>
<p>He was trembling so hard that everyone was wondering why he was horrified at me.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 331</p>
<p>Sergey was confident that he would be the first to register as an Awakened. Although the association had instructed them to refrain from any activities until the registration date, he couldn’t just suck on his fingers at home and do nothing. It was entirely possible that someone would beat it to him to get registered first.</p>
<p>The world was changing at an unprecedented speed. The Stage of Advent gave him unprecedented strength, so now it was time for him to claim the authority he was entitled to. He first contacted the Kremlin. Despite the presence of others who had similar motives there, he was eventually hired due to his previous experiences and successes in his career.</p>
<p>He heard a shocking story while being dispatched to London with the Minister of Finance. It was about the existence of a secret organization that deserved to be called the world’s government and the leader who controlled them. The hands of only one guy controlled the entire world.</p>
<p>“Keep your posture straight in front of him. You and I are going there on behalf of our President and Russia.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, okay, okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m warning you not to be overconfident just because you have a superpower.”</p>
<p>“Just because?”</p>
<p>“No, w…what I meant was… to look at his subordinates closely. You said that the leaders of the association are different from you guys.”</p>
<p>“Watch your mouth before I tear it apart.”</p>
<p>“...Sorry.”</p>
<p>“The King of Hell and the Plague Monster might have been under him, but is that still the case now? You don’t know anything about us, the Awakened. If what you mentioned is true and he once controlled the King of Hell and Plague Monster… Heh, heh. He will have to watch his back. Ah, that might be why.”</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>“The reason why the King of Hell and the Plague Monster didn’t appear in public so far. Both of them might be aiming for his head at the same time. Listen to me carefully. It’s Odin, not him, that you should hug onto.”</p>
<p>“Every Awakened I talk to is really afraid of Odin. Even people like you. Can you tell me more about the Stage of Advent?”</p>
<p>“It’s not your turn to ask yet. Tell me more about him. The club owner. Even if he is not an Awakened, he shouldn’t be underestimated as he has such a position. He could come out while being accompanied by guys like me. I need more information to figure out his weaknesses and control him the way I want.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Why? Is there any problem? Oh, you still haven’t grasped what’s going on even though I told you this much. His world is over. Club? That’s ridiculous. It’s now the World Awakened Association’s era. Soon, Odin and the Awakened will arrive.”</p>
<p>“The club and association have different names, but when it comes to the leadership…”</p>
<p>“How many times do I tell you? That’s an old story.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay. But do as I say until the world you speak of comes. If you don’t promise me, then I can’t take you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you are quite hard to deal with. You are really scared, but that’s a different matter. Answer my question.”</p>
<p>“Only the President knows about him.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so you don’t know anything? You talked like you know a lot about the club, but I guess you are not as great as you think, right?”</p>
<p>“Promise me you will only watch quietly with your companion. You definitely don’t want to miss this chance, right?”</p>
<p>That was correct. They claimed that it was an emergency meeting where capital forces from around the world gathered. He could receive a mission unexpectedly, and it might be to prevent any situations that could be caused by the other Awakened, not to subtly threaten the club’s owner.</p>
<p>To the Russian government, the club’s owner was irresistible like the leader of the Awakened ‘Odin.’ Until then, Sergey belittled the Russian government. Of course, he agreed that they possessed vast financial power and the authority of the person who relished such enormous wealth.</p>
<p>However, he witnessed an absolute deity that transcended any civilization created by mankind at the last moment of the Stage of Advent. But what the hell was going on here?</p>
<p>“I… I, I see you… O… Odin…” he stuttered.</p>
<p>Sergey’s balance collapsed without even realizing it.</p>
<p>“Are you gathering the Awakened from Russia?”</p>
<p>Sergey closed his eyes tightly. It was not just his voice, but also his face was also Odin’s. Sergey looked at the Minister of Finance he accompanied with a pale face. He asked for help with a desperate and sorrowful expression, reflecting a primal urge to survive that he had forgotten for a while.</p>
<p>Say something, you moron!</p>
<p>While Sergey was shouting inside, the Minister of Finance finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“It is true that there are Awakened who have contacted our government as Sergey did. However, we are making sure that no one is trying to circumvent the club’s authority with them as we have not received any updates from the club. So far we have only used their services in circumstances that mandate security, such as the current situation…”</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance immediately stopped talking as if he had realized his crucial mistake. Then, he introduced himself with a sincere apology, “It’s… an honor to meet you. I’m Egor Borbiyev. Vladimir wanted to express his apologies that he couldn’t attend in person.”</p>
<p>Sergey couldn’t bear to raise his head, so he listened to Odin’s voice while looking at the floor. His fate could be determined within the blink of an eye. If he had known that Odin was the owner of the club, then he wouldn’t have come even if they had given him Vladimir’s position!</p>
<p>At that time, he heard the Minister of Finance telling him to go out. He ascended into bliss as he scurried away, feeling as if those words had come from heaven.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meanwhile, at the State Council of the People’s Republic of China…</p>
<p>The paramount leader of China was ready, having finalized the constitutional amendment prior to the Day of Advent. This amendment eliminated the term limit for the paramount leader of the People’s Republic of China, solidifying his permanent hold on power.</p>
<p>The U.S. President begrudgingly accepted this and even said, “The Chinese leader is now called the ‘President for life.’ He was able to do it, and it’s a great achievement. It’s something our nation should try too.”</p>
<p>Reflecting on the past years was incredibly harsh.</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent was often referred to as the ‘Battlefield of Hell’ by Awakened, but for him, his childhood after his father was labeled as anti-party was a sequence of hellish experiences.</p>
<p>One of his sisters had committed suicide because she couldn’t overcome the scarlet letter of being a traitor’s daughter, but it wasn’t the case for him. He had fought the evils who had called his family and him traitors. Finally, the kid who had lived a more miserable life than a beggar triumphed over oppression and became the absolute leader of China.</p>
<p>However, there couldn’t be two emperors in the world. The club had taken out their knife as if they had reached the same conclusion as him. He expected that this day would come, but the timing was unexpected as the world had just defeated the invasion from alien monsters.</p>
<p>It was a time for stability not only for China but also for the entire world. The population needed to reconstruct the destroyed cities and ready themselves for the possibility of another economic downturn. The club’s true intention was clear as they took these measures, not just to contain Awakened in bronze, silver, and gold sections, but also to curb China’s growing power.</p>
<p>The paramount leader of China was certain that they wouldn’t lift economic sanctions even though China had released the detained Awakened.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>He looked at the person asking the question. This guy was the one who had insisted that the Awakened shouldn’t be confined, but he had also taken the lead when it began.</p>
<p>His name was Zheng Zhi. Despite his low status as a third-class sergeant in the Ministry of Public Security, he could now meet the paramount leader in person because his eyes glowed red in the dark. They were the red eyes of the Awakened. In fact, the paramount leader had actually turned off all the lights in his office as he wanted to see those eyes properly.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>Zheng Zhi explained, “We thought that he had died while he confronted Doom Dejire. Therefore, we carried out the quest to assassinate Mary. Most of the Awakened, excluding his allies and confidants, took up the challenge. However, it turned out he was not dead.”</p>
<p>Zheng Zhi continued on, and he ended with the reason why he had been able to get out alive.</p>
<p>“I was in the main attack squad of the Lord of Heaven. If I ran a separate offensive team like the other low-level ones, then I wouldn’t have been able to see you here.”</p>
<p>The paramount leader nodded slightly. “That is a relief.”</p>
<p>“...Sir. This is a matter of life and death to me.”</p>
<p>He soothed the fidgety man, “Don’t worry. We won’t give up on you as long as you stay in China. Also, I pay tribute to your decision on supporting China. Go to the General Inspector of Public Security. Your current status is too shabby.”</p>
<p>The man responded gratefully, “Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Turn on the light on your way out.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>The light turned on, and the leader’s flushed face was revealed.</p>
<p>The problem wasn’t the economic sanctions. The entire world had closed its doors to China, but the consequences were not limited to just China. Soon, the global community would understand the cost of cutting off relations with them.</p>
<p>The paramount leader turned on his computer and checked the videos. Even those who were called ‘idiots’ among the Awakened had an unbelievable power equivalent to the alien monsters. Zheng Zhi stated that the protective barrier generated by items enabled them to withstand being hit by firearms. He also claimed that their Strength allowed them to crush soldiers’ skulls and demolish structures and that their skills created flames and mysterious beings that fought for them.</p>
<p>Even those who were ridiculed among the Awakened were superhumans… It was difficult for him to calculate how transcendent Odin’s abilities were just from hearing Zheng Zhi’s explanation.</p>
<p>That was why he didn’t enter the bunker even though his subordinates had begged him to. All the Awakened he talked to said that no matter where he was, he wouldn’t be able to avoid Odin.</p>
<p>In other words, even if he hired the executives of the association such as Mary, the King of Hell, and Osiris as bodyguards, none of them would be able to stop Odin. They all agreed that Odin was undefeatable even if the entire population of the Awakened cooperated together.</p>
<p>Odin… He wondered if they could call such a being a human. There was a gunless war over the actual authority of the world with the club, but everything would ultimately be determined by Odin’s desires regardless of victory or defeat.</p>
<p>The paramount leader then became preoccupied as he was curious why Odin didn’t dominate the world with physical force. After all, he would have done it if he was him.</p>
<p>Did the slogan of the World Awakened Association open a new era and the peace of mankind?</p>
<p>It’s hilarious, but maybe… Odin sincerely wanted that.</p>
<p>Right then, the Minister of Finance rushed in. Then, he told him that the global stock markets, except for China, were rising together.</p>
<p>The paramount leader banged down on the desk and shouted, “That’s different from what you said would happen!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 332</p>
<p>I finished my tasks in London, assuming that China would struggle. Then, my next destination was a tranquil hotel in Virginia. Preparations were underway for a club meeting set to take place in two days.</p>
<p>There were bound to be protestors every time a club meeting was held. They still thought of us as the Bilderberg Club and shouted that they were not our slaves. However, this year’s conference would be carried out in silence. I didn’t see a single picket and then I passed through the security door.</p>
<p>News about my arrival spread throughout the hotel, but there were only a few who could directly face me. Mick was one of them. Although he wasn’t an official member of the club, he was responsible for security during the meeting. He called the Awakened ‘cats’ and oversaw item warehouses and military enterprises.</p>
<p>There was a familiar face next to Mick. He was a former member of Cat Food Warehouse and had been promoted to the point where he was able to secure one of the thirty seats among the Awakened. He also considered himself a resident of the Savior’s city.</p>
<p>Mason followed Mick into the room.</p>
<p>“I see you, Odin[1].”</p>
<p>I asked Mason after hearing about the hotel security situation from Mick, “The King of Hell’s whereabouts is unknown. Do you know anything about it?”</p>
<p>Mason responded quickly, “He said there was something he hadn't finished in the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>He was referring to those who shouldn’t have come back home.</p>
<p>I had many directives for Mick and Mason as there were programs that needed to be developed based on the various items stored at the Cat Food Warehouse and the association. These programs included a registration system, insignia, and item market.</p>
<p>After I provided them with a rough explanation, I gave him a contact number.</p>
<p>「 Carl &amp; Jane Law and Accounting Office 」</p>
<p>“Send someone useful. They will prepare the rest.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even with just a slight increase in Sense, I could hear the passionate voices of the club members. This was due to the occurrence of unpredictable events that happened between the meetings that were held between 2017 and 2018. The Day of Advent, the return of the Awakened and a sign of an economic boom were examples.</p>
<p>There were still two more days before the meeting began, but most of the members were already there, and their faces were filled with happiness. It was natural because they were sucking up the shares that I had finally begun to release.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the global stock market began to rise as if it was on fire. The political magazines, including the Guardian, played a part in the market’s enthusiasm and fueled the market’s excitement. When the media encouraged the public to buy stocks, it was an attempt to lure ants so that capital forces could shake off the damage and reemerge into the world.</p>
<p>However, there was a chance for those who believed the media this time. People were anxious as they were unable to purchase stocks, but if they did invest after being swayed by the media’s claims, they would deeply regret it.</p>
<p>Yesterday, the New York Stock Exchange alone rose six percent and the average increase in the world, excluding China, also approached six percent. Starting today, the global stock market wouldn’t stop as if it was racing through an autobahn.</p>
<p>People would turn a blind eye to the harm caused by the economic sanctions against China, and instead sing a song of hope for a new era, similar to the optimism during the dotcom bubble. The only difference is that the subject had changed from the Internet to the greatness of mankind.</p>
<p>I browsed through online news and clicked on an article that caught my attention.</p>
<p>「 Even Iran Has Turned Their Back on China</p>
<p>In a bold move, Iran has shut down their oil pipeline despite warnings from their largest customer, China. The National Iranian Tanker Company (NITC) has redirected its oil tanker back to its home port.</p>
<p>Sources reveal that nine out of the seventeen tankers transporting crude oil from Iran to China are operated by China, and Iran has reportedly resorted to armed conflict in an attempt to prevent them from operating.</p>
<p>The United States has denounced China’s detention of the Awakened as a reckless provocation against human peace, in defiance of the World Awakened Association’s guidelines. Moreover, they have praised the commitment of the three largest oil-producing countries within OPEC to maintaining peace among humanity.</p>
<p>However, as Iran has lost their biggest customer… 」</p>
<p>└ Iran can’t do much. Wouldn’t China be enough to be a loner?</p>
<p>└ China has been too confident until now. They have grown enough to fight for supremacy with us, but their one mistake in detaining the Awakened, who prevented the world’s destruction, has stopped them from escaping the same situation as Iraq.</p>
<p>└ You guys shouldn’t be here commenting on this right now. Have you bought stocks yet? It will go crazy this time.</p>
<p>└ The impact of these unprecedented sanctions on unemployment levels and the extent to which the national growth rate will decline remains uncertain. Despite the obvious unfavorable factors lying in front of us, buying stocks now only fills the stomach of financial giants, including Jonathan Investment Finance Group. The upswing is temporary. The whole world will soon realize how much they have relied on China.</p>
<p>└ Stupid. Jonathan Investment Finance Group is a hero. Shut up!</p>
<p>There were only five comments as most of the attention was concentrated on the articles mentioning the stock market boom.</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>「 The Party has Begun… Congratulations on the Great Boom!</p>
<p>Global financial markets, excluding China, have screamed joyfully. The events started when stocks from the Big Four (Jonathan Investment Finance Group, Gillian Investment Finance Group, Telestar Investment, and Gold and Silver Investment) flowed into the market.</p>
<p>Brian Kim, the Chief Financial Officer of Jonathan Investment Finance Group, stated, “We have recognized the strained market trend since the Day of Advent.”</p>
<p>The Chief Executive Officer of Asset Management at AP Morgan said, “I extend my praise to all the market defenders, including the Jonathan Group. The World Awakened Association wasn’t the only entity that saved the world. We were able to maintain civilization, thanks to those who protected the market.” He also announced that all companies that were previously criticized will be acknowledged for their worth from now on.</p>
<p>However, some are concerned about the situation. Critics address that the United States-led economic sanctions against China will bring a shock to the world like the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the global stock market soared by six percent, and the total market capitalization of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and NASDAQ alone increased by four hundred billion dollars as of yesterday.</p>
<p>The current surge in the market, while significant, pales in comparison to the estimated fifty trillion dollars that was lost worldwide during the Day of Advent. Nevertheless, despite facing the unfavorable impact of economic sanctions against China, the financial investment industry views the current state of the market as a celebratory milestone marking the onset of a global stock market boom…」</p>
<p>└ I knew it. I shouldn’t have listened to my wife. She said there’s no such thing as Awakened. Then did the alien monsters jump out of the shit? Ugh.</p>
<p>└ No one can expect when and where this rally will end.</p>
<p>└ I can hear AP Morgan’s sigh of relief. They will love it.</p>
<p>└ The Jonathan Group and those who defended the market are true heroes. Superman does exist. On the other hand, it’s a shame that I couldn’t join their heroics. It was a chance to become a hero and a billionaire.</p>
<p>└ It’s not too late! Let’s get on the board! If you hesitate, then you won’t get that chance ever again.</p>
<p>└ When you all realize when to buy and sell, you guys are already too late. If you have no idea, then close your eyes and buy it! I’m serious. Trust me.</p>
<p>└ Cheers to mankind, the World Awakened Association, and the Jonathan Group! Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!</p>
<p>└ I guarantee you that if you miss this opportunity, then you won’t be able to close your eyes in peace even if you die. This moment will linger in your mind.</p>
<p>The internet was flooded with articles similar to that one, and the number of views on them surpassed even those on topics like the Awakened and monsters. People didn’t stop commenting on them. This was a clear indication of the current market trend, and I wanted to tell them to stop typing and put all their assets into stocks. All in!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When I woke up, the global stock market was still racing. This occurred not only in the countries where the stock market was still open, but also there were others who were predicting the next day’s surge in the futures market.</p>
<p>The figures and symbols displayed on my tablet PC may not mean anything to some individuals, but those knowledgeable in finance would perceive China’s distress through it. It was not just an outcry, but rather a lamentation caused by confusion and decline.</p>
<p>I didn’t leave China alone until now because I liked them. Instead, I knew that their expansion was beneficial to the entire world. Until the Day of Advent, I channeled all my strength towards counteracting the fear that overshadowed it. However, it had come to an end. It was time for China to move within my order.</p>
<p>On the day before the club conference, I detected the presence of an uninvited guest around noon. Since Mason appeared unaware of this unexpected visitor, I knew that the intruder was using an item to conceal herself.</p>
<p>She wasn’t one of the formidable Awakened, so it was my first time seeing her. She didn’t even know I was watching her, so she was calmly walking down the hallway, looking for something. She was seeking me, the owner of the club.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the agent patrolling the hallway could only see me, so when he asked if I needed anything, the girl quickly turned her head toward me. I wondered what her first impression was of me. What was certain was that she didn’t recognize me. If she did, then she would be shivering like the Russian guy I had met at the salon.</p>
<p>She fixed her gaze on me for a while, and it appeared as if she had concluded that I wasn’t an Awakened. This was understandable as I had deactivated all my stats except for Sense.</p>
<p>She soon turned her head away from me and entered the room where the agent’s eyes were out of reach. It was a room assigned to the President of the United States. Also, the pleasant voice of the U.S. President was coming out of that door.</p>
<p>There were five members, including the president and representatives of traditional American families. One of the members was previously a board director at Jonathan Group but had since become the President of the U.S. Reserve Bank. The heads of the families and bank governors warmly welcomed the president into their ranks, and any tension that was previously present was no longer there.</p>
<p>The girl infiltrated there. Based on that, I knew that it was an A-class item, but her item wasn’t of high quality. Instead, she had probably used an insignia as well. Although this insignia wasn’t valued during the Stage of Advent, its significance couldn’t be disregarded as there were vast quantities of it around the world. Therefore, it was supposed to be under the control of the association. That was a work in progress along with the registration of the Awakened.</p>
<p>I followed the girl and stepped a foot into the room. It was the U.S. President’s first time seeing me, but the existing members of the association were already familiar with me. They all saluted me in unison and mentioned my code name ‘Odin,’ which was commonly used in the club and association.</p>
<p>Then, the girl realized she had walked into a dangerous situation, but it was too late. Ugh, I hadn’t cleaned all of the blood out of the sword…</p>
<p>[You have used Indra’s Sword.]</p>
<p>The room was dyed in blue light from the flashing bolts of lightning. The girl screamed, but everyone in the room, the members from a nearby room who rushed in after hearing the scream, and the security personnel all watched as she was quickly reduced into a pile of ashes.</p>
<p>1. The author must be a big fan of Avatar haha. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 333</p>
<p>The club members exerted significant influence over the lives of thousands of people with just a single approval. Whenever the U.S. Central Bank President changed the interest rate, even by a decimal percentage, businesses either went bankrupt or were resurrected, thereby determining the fate of families.</p>
<p>Aside from such economic power, the majority of the U.S. members played key roles in the Iraq War. It resulted in numerous casualties, both among the occupying forces and Iraqi civilians.</p>
<p>Those who killed a number of people were shocked that only one Awakened died. This was a time when the abilities of the Awakened weren’t well known by the public. Moreover, they didn’t realize that wiretapping devices were unnecessary for the Awakened who had reached the master section. Although people roughly had an idea of what the Stage of Advent was like, my actions were labeled as ‘murder’ instead of ‘punishment.’</p>
<p>Meanwhile, there was a general consensus among everyone regarding the identity of the dead girl. They all said she was Chinese, as it was unlikely that any other country besides China would have sent a spy. I agreed with this perspective.</p>
<p>The shock in the crowd slowly subsidized.</p>
<p>Evening arrived and dinner had just started. I eavesdropped on a conversation at the table while eating separately in my room. They were discussing Keynes’ theory as it was the perfect explanation for the shock that occurred in the financial market on the Day of Advent and the current surge in the global stock market. Both were the results of mob psychology because there was no reason for the stock markets to rise based solely on the facts alone.</p>
<p>The world had closed its doors to China, and now they closed doors on us. The reality was that the longer this economic sanction lasted, the more it would harm the global economy. Although we defeated the monsters, many cities were destroyed. No positive effects could be expected from there. The damage remained, so further destruction was expected.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that the Awakened would sweep gold from the alien civilizations at the moment. The mana stones were only monsters’ intestines, and only Yeon-Hee and I knew that they could be used as a new energy source. Nevertheless, the financial industry and the public craved stocks in pursuit of new hope.</p>
<p>“That’s right. Stories are more important than facts.”</p>
<p>There was someone here who shared my views. Although people widely recognized the relationship between human psychology and the stock market now, the economics community had only given it proper consideration during the Great Depression in the 1930s. This was during the time when Keynes was active. Moreover, even genius scientist Isaac Newton left a famous quote that no one could predict human madness after he was defeated in the stock market.</p>
<p>There was a reason why the two financial figures at the table were rediscussing Keynes. Keynes had used the term ‘wild impulse’ to refer to human psychology being reflected in the economy, but such a term wasn’t important. The significant thing was the conclusion that he had reached during the Great Depression of the 1930s.</p>
<p>Keynes’s reasoning was simple. His aim wasn’t to put forward a comprehensive theory about the impact of human psychology on the economy. It was possible that he wanted to be in a similar position as me.</p>
<p>Both economic and non-economic motives play a crucial role in shaping human economic behavior. The psychology of humans is prone to fluctuations, ranging from pessimism to optimism, and fear to hope, which can be determined by the stability of the economy. Hence, there is a need for effective measures to manage and regulate the irrational aspects of human behavior. In this regard, the intervention of the “visible hand” is deemed necessary to maintain the stability of the economy.</p>
<p>What Keynes referred to as ‘visible hands’ was here, the club! The people who were at the table where the conversation continued were proud that they were a part of the ‘visible hands.’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The supper was over. Then, I heard a clattering fork sound from there, as if dessert was being served. The conversation between the two men was moving on the agenda for tomorrow’s meeting.</p>
<p>“Let’s change the topic then. Our club is stronger than the Bilderberg in its heyday. It is undeniable that our authority in the club has decreased, but that’s not a big deal.”</p>
<p>“I agree. If Bilderberg still existed now, then it would have been ruined immediately.”</p>
<p>“It wouldn’t have survived the Day of Advent, and nothing like this would have happened. But do you think things will be fine this way?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“It’s not because of the Awakened. It looks like peace has been restored, but the world is still in chaos. Let’s assume one thing. Well… this is something that can actually happen sooner or later.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“His assets will be revealed to the public. Of course, people will only think of it as the Big Four’s property, including Jonathan Investment Finance Group. Excluding what he has given to paper companies, the public will be amazed by the assets of the Big Four alone, without going into further detail.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that must be the case. The value of the Big Four’s holdings will go up a few times more than now… I can’t even imagine how far it will increase.”</p>
<p>“There is no doubt that the figure will surprise even us, so the public reaction will be even more intense. They will definitely discuss the distribution of wealth. If public opinion takes a certain direction, we won’t be able to control the outcome no matter what actions we take. Look at the examples in America and Korea, where candidates we didn’t support were elected.”</p>
<p>Then, the two lowered their voices as if they were conscious of the U.S. President.</p>
<p>“That’s true. The public calls the Jonathan Group a hero now, but it’s not going to take long for them to turn their back on them. I see what you are thinking. Are you trying to revive ‘Tessera?’”</p>
<p>“The global public needs more direct control, don’t you agree? Not indirect controls like big data from Googol, but controls that can place them under the surveillance network of the club.”</p>
<p>“Mmm… But the problem is that Odin has already rejected that request.”</p>
<p>“He is not like who he was last year. He is more… Sigh. It gives me goosebumps when I think about it again. Did you see the Chinese Awakened woman’s face as she writhed in pain? There was not a bone left of her when he was done. Anyway, Odin must have changed his mind.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“So, I’m saying that he will agree with me that we should revive ‘Tessera.’ This is our chance.”</p>
<p>Project ‘Tessera…’ Tessera referred to the name tag that Roman slaves had to carry in the past. In other words, it was a sign of slavery, but what the two members were talking about wasn’t a wooden plaque, but a microchip that was implanted into a human organism. It would allow the club to track the locations of everyone in the world!</p>
<p>It was the top issue among the world’s slavery projects and remained widely used to this day. The technology was not difficult to implement and was commonly attached to luxury items like cars, clothing, and even the wealthy’s pets to prevent loss. But putting such a thing under the skin of people and the Awakened around the world?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Bilderberg Club had addressed this project after the 8.11 attacks, which was 9.11 terrorism in my past life. They saw an opportunity to advance the project due to the social climate and believed they could push for it. Under the Bilderberg Club’s guidance, the world’s media also promoted the idea that implanting subcutaneous microchips would greatly aid in tracking down suspected terrorists.</p>
<p>However, the public strongly opposed it. The club then reexamined kidnapping incidents to change the public’s mind, claiming that transplanting a microchip in the body would ease the concerns of parents with young children.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the plan went to pieces. The microchips injected under the skin of sex offenders were replaced by electronic anklets in the face of strong opposition from Christian and human rights groups. However, this didn’t mean that the project was wiped out completely as the summary of the plan still remained in the members’ heads.</p>
<p>Let’s say that we can use the notion of an alien invasion and a new era as a means to manipulate public opinion. Then, how will we implant microchips in people all over the world? That many? How can we make this terrible curse a blessing?</p>
<p>The solution was vaccines. The plan was to begin with children in underdeveloped countries and eventually offer free vaccinations to developed countries, all of which would be laced with microchips. This may appear sinister, and the club may be viewed as a source of evil. I couldn’t deny that.</p>
<p>However, human greed wasn’t limited to the stock market. I was certain that if Keynes had been a member of the Bilderberg Club, then he would have been more eager about this project than anyone else.</p>
<p>The club only had one motto: the only world government.</p>
<p>That was why club members constantly talked about control over the public, and this was why they gathered. It was clear that my Jeonil Club had the old Bilderberg Club as its foundation. I couldn’t take away the interests of all club members because the earth was too vast to be governed by a single absolute power.</p>
<p>The media reported that the Big Four, including the Jonathan Group, defended the Day of Advent. However, there were hidden contributors, the club members who had faithfully followed my instructions. We were able to maintain our civilization because they had exerted their influence and left the economic system open even on the Day of Advent. Thus, my relationship with them was between the ruler and the ruled.</p>
<p>This was the reason I left them alone even when they tried to plant a terrifying wiretapping device in all mankind. I couldn’t behead them just because I didn’t like a certain idea of theirs. In addition, their actions and thoughts weren’t against the club’s motto.</p>
<p>‘But if the chipped people became the Awakened?’</p>
<p>It was necessary to keep a close watch on them even if I didn’t confine them within one fence. On the other hand, the Awakened were bound to be implanted with microchips for identification purposes, even if it meant surveilling them. Doctors would administer anesthetics to their triceps and insert microchips using needles. I was confident that they wouldn’t resist, as this would be a mandatory requirement for registration, not only because it was an order under the name of Odin.</p>
<p>Yes, tomorrow’s club conference would resolve the agendas that would compel the Awakened to join the association. This was where the World Awakened Association and the world would come to an agreement. Although it was unfair, no one would be able to refute my statement.</p>
<p>I am Odin, the owner of the club, and the most powerful Awakened in the Ender section.</p>

<p>Chapter 334</p>
<p>“Everything is ready.”</p>
<p>Jonathan and Joshua were still gone, so Kim Cheong-Soo had no choice but to notify us of their absence.</p>
<p>“Out of 131 members, one was represented by someone from the Rothschild family. It was confirmed that one member didn’t come back from the Stage of Advent, while Peter D. Friedman is now recognized as a master section Awakened as you already know.”</p>
<p>It meant that I was the only one left to go to the conference room.</p>
<p>[* Inventory]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor (God of War) has been removed.]</p>
<p>When the armor suddenly appeared and attached itself to my body, Jamie cried out softly in surprise.</p>
<p>Ah.</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor (God of War) has transformed into Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Battle).]</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Golden Armor (God of Battle).]</p>
<p>Upon entering the Ender section, I was now able to summon eight Valkyries. These female warriors, with their short hair and bandaged chests and bottoms, looked like real humans to Jamie. She was mesmerized by their presence, unable to look away. When she attempted to speak to them, the Valkyries simply followed me with blank expressions.</p>
<p>Everyone looked at Valkyries along the way to the conference hall. Mason was the first to recognize what they truly were as his face instantly became pale. He seemed to be punishing himself for failing to prevent yesterday’s infiltration as he was the sole Awakened among the security chiefs. A sense of failure surrounded him as if he believed that I no longer trusted him.</p>
<p>I reassured him, “You couldn’t do much yesterday, Mason.”</p>
<p>I patted him on the shoulder and passed by him.</p>
<p>The conference hall was quiet. They all knew about the Chinese girl’s death. They stood up in unison and held their breath, but their eyeballs were focused on the Valkyries, who were holding various weapons and shields, and my armor.</p>
<p>Ordering the Valkyries around was similar to using a skill as it was guided by the user’s will through their Sixth Sense. As soon as I activated my Sixth Sense, the Valkyries swiftly positioned themselves at the four doors of the hall, standing guard.</p>
<p>Stamp! Stamp!</p>
<p>Two Valkyries were stationed per door. Their emotionless gazes were fixed forward, and they heightened the seriousness of the conference hall.</p>
<p>I said, “We will spare no money in hiring the Awakened in the future.”</p>
<p>It meant that I wouldn’t stop the members from employing Awakened privately, so everyone’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>My reasoning was simple. I was bound to get an order from Doom Kaos one day, and it was obvious that he would demand that I go attack other dimensions. In the Stage of Advent, there were useful tools, XP, and boxes, so the Awakened used them to gain dominance over the world.</p>
<p>But now, with those resources gone, a new approach was necessary. The second option was to scare them while securing their cooperation. Thus, it was essential to ensure they still had access to the benefits they had in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent was dominated by force, but this world was controlled by wealth. Actually… It was my goal to keep this world dominated by money and to maintain consistency between pre- and post-Stage of Advent. I hoped the Awakened would familiarize themselves with capitalism, and I would create such an environment for them.</p>
<p>Also, I didn’t know what dimension I would have to attack, but I would use the resources that existed there to make the Awakened chase the money. I wished there were resources equivalent to mana stones there. A gold mine would be better.</p>
<p>I announced, “Sit down, everybody. Let’s start this year’s meeting.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Members began to present agendas on behalf of their families or countries of influence. They all knew that this year’s conference would determine the future of mankind. Therefore, they were no longer conscious of the guarding Valkyries anymore and were enthusiastic about the meeting.</p>
<p>At present, the topic of discussion was the direction of the basic interest rate of the U.S. Central Bank. The global economy revolved around monetary policy, and the member, the bank president, proposed a gradual rate cut. He was aware of my intention to drive a boom in the global stock market.</p>
<p>The public thought that interest rates were determined by the U.S. Central Bank, but nope. It was decided in this small conference room. This was why club members made investments and always retained money. It was impossible to lose money as they knew the future.</p>
<p>Besides stocks, it was evident that they were also considering derivatives influenced by interest rates. Matters of conflicting interests between families and nations were postponed to tomorrow’s meeting, then the conference proceeded in earnest.</p>
<p>One of the U.S. members raised the topic of the project Tessera, then almost all of the members agreed to it. The support wasn’t limited to just the member who brought it up. Of course, they weren’t going to implant microchips into their own bodies.</p>
<p>Anyway, all members had been waiting for this opportunity to come back because a shocking incident, which was more horrifying than the 8.11 terrorist attack, had just occurred.</p>
<p>I had already come to a conclusion yesterday, so I immediately dismissed the idea on the spot.</p>
<p>“It would be good to proceed only for the Awakened. It will be implemented instantly in time for the Awakened registration date, so never mention that project again.”</p>
<p>I put an end to it, and there was no counter-question.</p>
<p>Peter D. Friedman stood out among the general members as he was the only Awakened and could be considered an executive of the association. He had started calling himself Horus[1]. He wriggled his eyebrows and hurriedly fixed his face. That level of distinction was only evident when compared to other members, but he wasn’t exceptional.</p>
<p>He could have thought the issue was unfair because who would want to put a slave label on their body? Meanwhile, the other members regretted that this chance had come to naught.</p>
<p>I tilted my upper body and opened my mouth as I was resting my chin on my hand.</p>
<p>“There is an agreement that has to be stated between the World Awakened Association and the United Nation.”</p>
<p>Then, Jamie moved just in time. She kindly put the file on the table for each member, then began to examine the documents after returning to her seat. I also got a copy.</p>
<p>「 Agreement Between the World Awakened Association and the United Nations About the Members’ Status</p>
<p>Article 1</p>
<p>The term “members” shall refer exclusively to those individuals who have undergone and successfully completed the formal admission procedure as prescribed by the World Awakened Association.</p>
<p>Article 2 Facilities and Zones - Provision</p>
<p>The World Awakened Association shall have the right to use the facilities and zones within the territory of member states of the United Nations. The usage of each individual facility and zone shall be established through agreements reached by the World Awakened Association’s Board of Directors Conference, which the relevant member state of the United Nations must then execute. The term “facilities and zones” encompasses all existing facilities, fixtures, and settlements used in the operation of such facilities and zones, regardless of their geographic location.</p>
<p>Article 3 Facilities and Zones - Security Measures</p>
<p>The World Awakened Association shall have the authority to undertake any and all measures deemed necessary for the establishment, operation, protection, and management of its facilities and zones. Furthermore, member states of the United Nations shall take the necessary measures within the bounds of their respective laws and regulation, concerning the land, territorial waters, and airspace adjacent to or surrounding the facilities and zones of the World Awakened Association, with the aim of providing support to its members and facilitating access. The World Awakened Association shall also have the discretion to take any necessary steps to fulfill the aforementioned objectives.」</p>
<p>At that point, the position that Horus and general members had began to change. A smile appeared on Horus’s face while the faces of the others became stiff. They looked as if they had never seen such an unreasonable and one-sided agreement. Even a defeated country wouldn’t stamp such an agreement, and this was out of common sense.</p>
<p>This implied that if the World Awakened Association made a request, then they would be given anything they needed, including land, ocean, and sky, as well as all necessary resources and manpower.</p>
<p>However, it was too early to be appalled. Such a thing was possible without this agreement. The largest problem with this agreement lay on Article 22, which dealt with Criminal Jurisdiction.</p>
<p>「Article 22 Criminal Jurisdiction</p>
<p>The World Awakened Association holds the authority to enforce all criminal jurisdictions and disciplinary powers granted by the Association to its members within the territories of UN member states. The Association shall also have the exclusive right to exercise jurisdiction over all crimes related to the safety of UN member states, including those concerning the safety of UN member states.</p>
<p>1. “Crimes concerning the safety of UN member states” include the following:</p> Treason against the relevant country Infringement of laws and regulations that pertain to obstruction, espionage, or the confidentiality of official or defense secrets of the concerned country. <p>2. UN member states are required to provide assistance to the World Awakened Association in conducting all necessary investigations into crimes and acquiring evidence.</p>
<p>3. The World Awakened Association holds the right to exert its police powers within the facilities and zones designated in accordance with Article 2 of this Agreement. The Association may take necessary actions within the confines of its facilities and zones.」</p>
<p>Cough.</p>
<p>The sound of a dry cough filled the space while people gazed around at each other. Everyone, except for Horus, looked at the agreement with horror. The same applied to the Gillian couple. They were waiting for another member to come forward, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>In one sentence, the agreement was basically telling the world not to get involved in anything that the World Awakened Association did. It required the world not to get involved with their matters, even when an Awakened committed murder or conducted treasonous acts. Therefore, the reactions of political and military members were more noticeable than financial members.</p>
<p>People started looking at me with hesitation, and they were shifting their work to others.</p>
<p>Gasp-</p>
<p>When I tapped the agreement while taking a big breath in, the chaotic atmosphere died down.</p>
<p>I made eye contact with the U.S. President, and his Adam's apple wobbled. Then, he said in a voice that no longer shook, “Things will turn out as you wish.”</p>
<p>Another member beside him said, “Things will turn out as you wish.”</p>
<p>And the others also said, “Things will turn out as you wish.”</p>
<p>Then, everyone said the same thing as if it had become our slogan. All the members lowered their heads in their seats and chorused unanimously, “Things will turn out as you wish, Odin.”</p>

<p>Ilsung Hotel in Seoul, Korea.</p>
<p>As Ki-Cheol was eating the meal he had ordered via room service, he clicked his mouse. The articles that he had been reading recently were all about the Awakened.</p>
<p>「 Bloody Conflict due to a Fight Between Awakened - Japan</p>
<p>▷ Newsreader Kim Il-Hyung: We will connect to Tokyo today. Reporter Joo In-Seong!</p>
<p>▶ Reporter Joo In-Seong of KBC: Yes, I am in Tokyo.</p>
<p>▷ Newsreader Kim Il-Hyung: There has been constant news about the Awakened recently from all over the world, and we received news about the bloody conflict in Japan yesterday.</p>
<p>▶ Reporter Joo In-Seong of KBC: That is true. More than a hundred people including police officers and ordinary citizens were caught in this fight between a male and a female Awakened, and thirteen of them died.</p>
<p>▷ Newsreader Kim Il-Hyung: Don’t we have to capture the two Awakened or at least punish them? How has the judicial process been since then?</p>
<p>▶ Reporter Joo In-Seong of KBC: The whereabouts of the two Awakened are currently unknown…</p>
<p>└ What the freak? Thirteen died because of a small quarrel? Danggg.</p>
<p>└ They saved the world, but their hearts are not like the main characters of the heroic movies. Fuck. Don’t forget they had fought and killed for decades. They are murder machines. I attached the link below</p>
<p>└ Watch this.</p>
<p>└ You will die if you annoy the Awakened.</p>
<p>└ I wish I could see them for myself. It’s a shame that there are only fewer than three hundred Awakened in Korea.</p>
<p>└ Shut up if you don’t know a thing. Lee Tae-Han and Kwon Seong-Il are at the top of the association. The others lower their heads around them. I’m dead serious.</p>

<p>「 Surviving the Unimaginable: Catalina Ronea’s Harrowing Memories</p>
<p>Catalina Ronea gave off a strong and confident demeanor, reminiscent of a character straight out of ‘Miami Gangster.’ Specifically, she reminded me of the final scene where the female lead transforms into a ruthless boss. Ronea exuded the image of a collected and in-control female leader at the forefront of a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>However, pain overwhelmed her face as she started tracing her memories. The mere presence of her during the interview showcased her bravery in facing psychological turmoil.</p>
<p>I know everyone’s curious about the Stage of Advent. Someone had to share this to the world, so I decided to take this interview.</p>
<p>Thank you so much, but I am concerned that this interview will cause issues for you. May I still proceed with the interview?</p>
<p>By refraining from this, it will take longer for society to embrace us. Despite the potential consequences from the association for speaking out about what I had gone through, I am prepared to face them. However, I believe they won’t do anything about this.</p>
<p>Why is that?</p>
<p>One of the mottos of the World Awakened Association is ‘Peace in Humanity.’ We want peace. I’m not an official member of the association yet, but I’m waiting eagerly for the registration date to be announced. I hope there’s no confusion between us and the non-Awakened in the world.</p>
<p>Then, where should we start? Do as you please.</p>
<p>First of all, I want to remind everyone that I’m in the gold section. The Awakened are divided into seven sections: bronze, silver, gold, platinum, diamond, master, and challenger. In fact, people in the master or above section are usually in leadership positions, and they dominated the Stage of Advent for decades. First, let’s make it clear that my perspective can be different from someone who is in a leadership position.</p>
<p>You used the term ‘dominate.’</p>
<p>There was a very strict hierarchy in that world with clear distinctions between those who held power and those who were subordinates. Have you read ?</p>
<p>Yes, it’s a novel that depicts a dystopian world created by boys stranded on a deserted island.</p>
<p>The ‘monster’ in that novel was an illusion created by the leadership to control people. However, we experienced the real thing. It wasn’t just the monster. The first hideous being that we had to deal with was the System.</p>
<p>System? Could you tell us more about it?</p>
<p>At first, we thought of it as a computer game because it really was like that. It gave us quests and in return we got superpowers when we completed those quests. However, we soon realized its true identity. In addition to the quests it sent out to hunt monsters or conquer targeted dungeons… (Catalina was speechless for a moment) It then started sending us quests to kill each other.</p>
<p>Think about it. I was just an actress struggling to secure basic necessities such as food, clothing, and shelter. At times, I was forced to participate in battles against menacing monsters. My future was uncertain and, amidst all the chaos, I was commanded to take the life of someone living with me.</p>
<p>I tried to resist, but no one could do that.</p>
<p>Why not?</p>
<p>Even if I gave up on the quest, it didn’t guarantee that others would do the same. Everyone had gotten the quest. In that situation, giving up is stupid. Also, when a person died from the quest, the Guide called it “falling behind.”</p>
<p>Then, the fact that you survived such a quest meant…</p>
<p>Yes, I completed an assassination quest too. But there were more terrifying things. One of the quests put three people in one space and only allowed one to come out alive. I don’t know all of the quests, but I’m just saying that there were a number of vicious quests that the System and the Guides created.</p>
<p>The Guides?</p>
<p>They were the ones who ran the Stage of Advent. They were beautiful like Tinkerbell when they were blue, but they were evil when they turned red. Crushing a human’s skull wasn’t a big deal to them. They were confident that they were executors of the System, so they ordered us to kill colleagues or absolute beings. I can’t just say that it was a continuation of survival and battle in the Stage of Advent because of them.</p>
<p>I know what you are thinking at this point because we all did. However, the System wasn’t a god, and the Guides weren’t Grim Reapers. They were… our enemies.</p>
<p>Are they still giving the Awakened orders?</p>
<p>No. Odin had been fighting against them on the stage. Thanks to him, we were freed from the malicious quests. He is the only one who defeated a ‘Doom,’ so we were able to return home as he had defended us from supernatural beings.</p>
<p>From our perspective, the Awakened, like you, are supernatural beings.</p>
<p>The power of the Awakened varies widely depending on the section. The higher the section and the level, the more powerful they are. I said that I was in the gold section earlier, so compared to you, I must be a supernatural being.</p>
<p>However, the leaders of the association who hold the ranks of master and challenger are supernatural beings to me. Among them, Odin… (Catalina had a hard time continuing her words) stands out as the only one who has defeated one of the Seven Demon Kings, known as the Dooms. These Dooms are worshiped by the same alien creatures that invaded us. He was the only one who confronted them face to face.</p>
<p>Then, Odin is…</p>
<p>That’s all I will say of him. (As is known, Catalina showed high respect toward Odin similar to how the other Awakened refer to him.). Let me be clear. If you are going to ask me anything else about him, I’m leaving.</p>
<p>Okay, sounds good. You guys must have missed your home a lot.</p>
<p>Of course. We spent about twenty years on the stage. But for those who went into dungeons related to the ‘Land of the Dead,’ which had a different time and space, their experience must have been double or triple the amount of the time that I had experienced.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Stage of Advent continued for a long time even after the malicious System disappeared. Monsters kept pouring out, and they became stronger. Imagine a world where thousands of creatures, which you have only seen in horror movies, use terrifying supernatural powers to kill you and your group. Although the cruel System was gone, it left us with deep wounds. We no longer trusted each other, and the power gap between us only grew with time.</p>
<p>The decades we struggled through were just like that. What do you think?</p>
<p>It was under the law of the jungle.</p>
<p>There are many who couldn’t come back alive. Some were killed by monsters or the other Awakened, but look. The Stage of Advent consisted of nine stages. Three stages in Act One, and six stages in Act Two. There was a clear goal that we had to achieve in each stage. Before that, it’s important to note that the Stage of Advent began with 4.5 million groups. The purpose of Act One, Stage One was to form groups of a hundred people each and stop the Kciphos waves.</p>
<p>The Kciphos is one of the alien corps, right?</p>
<p>Yes. Let’s talk about Act One, Stage One first. The Kciphos army continued to flock in larger numbers as the days passed. The objective of Act One, Stage One was to stop them until the end. My group barely succeeded in this, but many others failed. What do you think would have happened to them?</p>
<p>Annihilation?</p>
<p>That was how the Stage of Advent was organized. If a group couldn’t successfully finish the mission, then they were annihilated. Then, as I mentioned earlier, they ‘fell behind.’</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent was indeed ruled by the laws of the jungle, but it was necessary. Without the strong Awakened as the driving force and under strong control, the quests in each stage wouldn’t have been accomplished. The law of the jungle was like a natural provision for survival, and we took it for granted. Even though the stronger were in charge of our lives and deaths, survival came first for us.</p>
<p>What do you mean by ‘us?’ Are you talking about the Awakened in gold section?</p>
<p>I’m referring to those in the bronze, silver, and gold sections. We call ourselves ‘Bsilgol.’ We were complementary resources to the Awakened in the higher sections. Aside from the production work, we had a duty to satisfy their basic needs and serve as a warehouse for them. During a time when the outcome of battles was determined by a mere piece of paper, we too entered the fight. The frequency increased as time passed.</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent got scarier and scarier.</p>
<p>What you mean by ‘basic needs’ are…</p>
<p>There is nothing to worry about. That’s right. It includes sexual desire. We had to do anything to be protected, and we couldn’t resist the orders from above.</p>
<p>But we, the Bsilgol, didn’t simply rest on our laurels. We grew stronger when the box system was replaced with a level system. In fact, several people from Bsilgol were promoted to higher ranks or became captains during this transition.</p>
<p>What do you mean by the transformation from box to level system?</p>
<p>It’s not worth talking about as the System is gone. The details will be covered in my book, which will be published soon.</p>
<p>Did the System disappear?</p>
<p>Yes, right before we returned home. Therefore, the strength of the Awakened will remain unchanged. Any new changes will depend on the remaining items and insignias.</p>
<p>The System has vanished, and the struggle for survival you went through has come to an end. In this aftermath, the tensions and stress of the Awakened seem to be bursting out all around the world.</p>
<p>There is something I want everyone to know. The World Awakened Association promised to advance humanity into outer space. Until then, you should understand the lives of us, the Awakened.</p>
<p>What were Jews like in World War II? They had to watch their families and friends being sacrificed and lived with anxiety and guilt until they died. What about the Vietnamese War? The war heroes, who returned home, suffered a lot to shake off their morbid psychological stress, and many took their own lives as they couldn’t bear it. However, their country ignored them.</p>
<p>You guys can’t do this to us. It’s a separate matter from the fact that we had saved the world.</p>
<p>So you are saying that Awakened needs practical support from the government, right?</p>
<p>The World Awakened Association is already helping us in many ways. The King of Hell spent a trillion dollars on us. I’m not telling the countries that they have to aid the Awakened. I’m saying that they at least have to show their understanding and sincerity toward us. Aside from the association’s motto of ‘peace,’ countries around the world should also work with them.</p>
<p>As I said previously, we have all returned from a hellish experience that far exceeded anything one could imagine. The current situation is a result of the lack of understanding from those around the world. It’s dangerous to approach us with mere curiosity, and nations must establish measures to prevent this. It’s imperative that global citizens are made aware of this issue.</p>
<p>Can I interpret this as the perspective of the Awakened regarding the murder case?</p>
<p>Of course. Don’t approach us with curiosity. We are not cartoon characters. We literally crawled out of hell. This is why I came here today. I understand you guys have so many questions about us, but please wait for us to adapt to our homeland.</p>
<p>There is one last thing I would like to ask.</p>
<p>Go ahead.</p>
<p>Can I anticipate the sequel to the movie ‘Miami Gangster?’</p>
<p>I already signed the contract before the Day of Advent. As an actress, I am looking forward to meeting the audience. I won’t need a stuntman anymore. You will be able to see some amazing action scenes. I can guarantee that to you.</p>
<p>I hope you love the sequel of the film ‘Miami Gangster’ and my upcoming memoir.</p>
<p>I felt a shiver run down my spine after the interview as I became aware of the years of suffering that lay beneath Catalina’s smile. The environment she was in was controlled by power, and it was beyond my comprehension what she had endured just to make it through a living nightmare.</p>
<p>The Awakened brought salvation to the world. However, their access to supernatural abilities didn’t materialize out of thin air. They earned these powers through a struggle for survival that lasted for decades. They battled against extraterrestrial beasts in a civilization where survival was the only objective, and they were successful in defeating these monsters and returning from the war front.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember their accomplishments and their bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. Against the brutal and vicious monsters…」</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol turned his head from the monitor to look out of the door of the room. Then, he saw his father, Seong-Il, who was lying on the couch, scratching his butt while he was only in his underwear.</p>
<p>There was one thought that crossed his mind.</p>
<p>How can he be a murder machine? He is just an ordinary old guy.</p>
<p>“Dad! I’ll be back in a few hours.”</p>
<p>“Okay, don’t get lost, son. Can you find your way back?”</p>
<p>“I’m not a kid… I’ll see you later.”</p>

<p>Chapter 336</p>
<p>As Seong-Il had stated, multiple buildings such as the Ilsung Hotel, Ilsung Department Store, and Ilsung Duty Free Shop were connected to one another. Even though there were signs everywhere to direct shoppers and hotel guests, it was easy to get lost.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol took the wrong path from the hotel to the department store, so he barely made it back to the hotel. He asked people standing nearby for directions to the swimming pool. Among them, the pool reserved for VVIP members was at the ideal temperature for them to use until April.</p>
<p><em>This is awesome.</em></p>
<p>Ki-Cheol had thought that only k-dramas had people in a high enough class to enjoy such a life. The TV shows were fake, but this was the reality.</p>
<p>When a glamorous woman walked in front of him in a bikini, Ki-Cheol couldn’t take his eyes off her gorgeous back. His puberty hormones were at their peak, so he hurriedly settled on the sunbed as all his blood was drawn to his bottom.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol swallowed and then turned on the messenger application on his phone.</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Do you know who I just saw?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Who?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Kwon Se-Hee. She was in a bikini, and she was fucking hot.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Stop lying.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: No, I’m not!&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Odin’s son: If your dad is Caliber, then my dad is Odin, you jackass.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: You are going to be in big trouble, Yong-Joo. Hurry up and change your username back to your name... You should never use his name like that.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Odin’s son: Fuck you. Why not just Odin? You are using Caliber’s name like that.&gt;</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol took a selfie that showed the swimming pool and the back of the famous actress Kwon Se-Hee. Then, he sent the photo to Lee Yong-Joo.</p>
<p>&lt;Odin’s son: What is this? Where are you?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: The pool at Ilsung Hotel. This one is only for VVIP. It’s unbelievable here.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Odin’s son: Wtf.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Come. My dad said I can hang out with my friends anytime here.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Odin’s son: Yo, for real?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: You should’ve trusted me from the beginning.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Hey, is it true? Is your father really the Caliber?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Lmao.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: WUT THE ACTUAL FUCK?!&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: I’m so bored by myself. Come, man. Don’t tell anyone else, though. Just you. I give you special permission lol. Tell the hotel lobby that you came to see me.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Omg I have goosebumps now.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: How long will it take for you to get here?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Two hours?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Just take a taxi, and tell the lobby that it’s under my dad.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Caliber?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Yea. Hurry up. I’m so bored.</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Yong-Joo: Kk. See you soon.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Caliber’s son: Okay.&gt;</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol enjoyed swimming while waiting for his best friend Yong-Joo to come. He deliberately moved to bump into Kwon Se-Hee while pretending that it was an accident. When she passed in front of him, his gaze naturally turned toward her butt.</p>
<p><em>Kwon Se-Hee in a bikini? In front of me?</em></p>
<p>From that, Ki-Cheol realized just how powerful his father was. The Internet had been talking about all sorts of things regarding the Awakened, but what remained unchanged was that Awakened were the heroes who saved the world. Just because a small number of Awakened caused problems, not all of them could be accused of murder machines. He knew it was true just by looking at his dad.</p>
<p><em>Those who know nothing about it are always like that. Idiots.</em></p>
<p>Thoughts like that ruined his initial excitement, so he came out of the pool. Looking at Kwon Se-Hee in a bikini wasn’t interesting to him anymore, so he went back to browsing the Internet and commented on articles that criticized the Awakened.</p>
<p><em>Ugh, you guys really don’t know how to be grateful. They saved you, and now you guys are telling them to fuck off. Tsk tsk.</em></p>
<p><em>No? Only two of them caused trouble, and now you are accusing the innocent ones.</em></p>
<p><em>Humanity will come to an end if you keep talking shit about the Awakened. They are the ones who blew away the monsters that the world’s armed forces couldn’t deal with. If the Awakened were out of control as you said, then the world would have been already over. How are you going to stop them then?</em></p>
<p><em>One of my friends is an Awakened, and he is hella nice. Shut up if you don’t know much about them.</em></p>
<p>Ki-Cheol had no good recollection of his father from his childhood. Back then, his father was always arguing with his mother, and Ki-Cheol was always nervous when Seong-Il raised his voice because he was so big. It was also difficult to understand why his mother kept fighting him back. He was constantly worried that one day Seong-Il wouldn’t be able to take it and end up hitting his mother. As a result, whenever they fought, Ki-Cheol cried and grabbed his father's pants to stop him.</p>
<p>Looking back, his mother was to blame for all of the household appliances that had gotten broken. Whenever they fought, his father would often stay outside for a few days, and when he returned, they would fight again because he was drunk.</p>
<p>However, his dad had actually changed. Not only did he treat his mother kindly, but he was also nice to the old guy, who Ki-Cheol didn't want to call stepdad. Even the old guy, who talked shit about his dad whenever his mom was away.</p>
<p>His ‘stepdad’ could be described as ‘someone who would work him to the bone until death and then sell waste paper to afford oneself.’ The old guy also scolded Ki-Cheol and mocked him, claiming that he would turn out to be as awful as Seong-Il since they were blood-related. Ki-Cheol didn’t tell Seong-Il anything because he thought Seong-Il would kill the old man, but he assumed his father was aware of it.</p>
<p>However, he didn’t punch the old brat. Instead, he thanked him for taking good care of Ki-Cheol.</p>
<p>Seong-Il had changed just like that, so all the bullshit that people said on the Internet was nonsense. If he was a murder machine, then he would have cracked the old guy’s skull open immediately.</p>
<p>“Here!”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol found Yong-Joo from afar. It was quite fun to see Yong-Joo looking around in a hurry.</p>
<p>“Dang, you were right. You weren’t lying.”</p>
<p>“I told you, bro. My dad is the Caliber.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol wrapped his arm around Yong-Joo’s neck. Without Yong-Joo, it would have been hard to meet up with his dad again.</p>
<p>In fact, he had been ready to withdraw all the money from his account and join the Runaway Club in Busan before the Day of Advent. He had wanted to move as far as possible from Seoul. Yong-Joo was the friend who chased him to the bus terminal and stopped him.</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m not saying this because he is your dad, but the Caliber is the top of the Awakened. He must be really strong.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol responded proudly, “He is in the challenger section.”</p>
<p>“Dang… So, are you going to live here from now on?” asked Yong-Joo.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol shrugged. “Maybe.”</p>
<p>“What about school?”</p>
<p>“I’ll think about it if school opens again. He said he will do whatever I want. We will probably move closer to school. I don’t want to transfer either.”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo’s eyes widened. “That’s amazing.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol offered, “So, come visit me anytime until then. I told my dad about you, and he said your parents are also welcome here. There are plenty of rooms, so just tell me if they want to visit.”</p>
<p>“Wow, your dad is so rich.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol shook his head. “Uncle Lee Tae-Han is super rich, not my dad. This hotel is also his. You know about Uncle Lee, right?”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo nodded. “Yeah, the Ilsung guy.”</p>
<p>“Yup, I had dinner with him last night.”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo’s mouth gaped open. “Wait, so Lee Tae-Han is your uncle now?”</p>
<p>“Stop calling him by his full name. He is my uncle now. You’d better show some respect.”</p>
<p>“Hey but… Are you not afraid of your dad?” Yong-Joo whispered.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol frowned. “What do you mean? He is my dad. Don’t trust the assholes on the Internet because they know nothing.”</p>
<p>“Have you seen this? Oh… it’s gone. It’s okay. I downloaded it already.”</p>
<p>“What is it?” Ki-Cheol asked.</p>
<p>“Just watch it. It’s crazy.”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo handed his smartphone to Ki-Cheol. The video in there was different from the photos that were circulating on the Internet. It wasn’t a scene where alien monsters’ intestines were flowing out of their exposed stomachs or disgusting heads rolling around the ground.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol’s heart started beating fast when he spotted something. There was definitely a crushed face of a person sticking out of the building’s wreckage. It was hard for him to properly watch the video as he couldn’t even stand seeing the smashed cat stuck below the car. He hurriedly turned off the phone and frowned.</p>
<p>“Ew. Why are you keeping this in the album?” he asked, grimacing.</p>
<p>“I wanted to show you.”</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“You don’t want to watch it anymore?”</p>
<p>Since then, Ki-Cheol glanced at it with his eyes half-closed. Just as Kwon Se-Hee in front of him was real, the pandemonium in the video actually existed too.</p>
<p>The main character in that video was a Chinese man who was clearly an Awakened. He was yelling in rage, and Ki-Cheol was able to identify him as Chinese because the road signs were written in Chinese characters. Every time the man walked around, blood splattered and limbs were thrown in all directions.</p>
<p>He was the most terrifying monster Ki-Cheol had ever seen. There were many soldiers in the chaotic city, but they were not enough to handle the monsters. One of the monsters ripped off the soldiers’ heads alive. As their decapitated heads were separated from their bodies, their spines fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol stopped the video as he had somehow begun to feel dizzy. His pounding heart didn’t seem able to calm down and instead thumped against his chest. The adrenaline inside him soared. This was Ki-Cheol’s first time seeing such a horrifying sight in his life, so he couldn’t bear to watch anymore. He felt nauseous and knew that the video would remain in his head forever, just like when he had accidentally clicked pornography on the Internet.</p>
<p>Moreover, this video was…</p>
<p>He looked away and grumbled, “Ah, shit. You should have told me what it was. That’s so disgusting. Also, my dad is different from this guy. He is just normal. Do you want to say hi to him?”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, my dad also wants to meet you. Come.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seong-Il gave Yong-Joo plenty of pocket money and told him to continue being friends with Ki-Cheol. He was willing to do anything for Yong-Joo, who had helped Ki-Cheol to stay on the right track.</p>
<p>“Could you show me your skills, please? Please?” Yong-Joo asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head and laughed. “This hotel will collapse if I use my skills. Hahaha. I’m telling you only because you are Ki-Cheol’s friend. I don’t need skills because my fist is enough for everything.”</p>
<p>“Wow, but why are you called Caliber?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his head. “Umm… It’s supposed to be ‘Human Caliber,’ but if you put ‘human’ in front, it’s not that fancy.”</p>
<p>“Human Caliber?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s because I wield humans like weapons. That’s my main skill.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>
<p>“Is there anything else you want to ask?” Seong-Il asked patiently.</p>
<p>“Then… have you killed humans?”</p>
<p>“Hey!” Ki-Cheol shouted instantly.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, son. Let me just say that I removed them rather than ‘killed’ them.” He continued, “I’ve broken the heads of traitors. Everyone was like that, so be careful if you bump into an Awakened. If you do, then just tell them that your friend’s dad is Caliber. Then, they will fuck off.”</p>
<p>“Whoa. I have another question. Have you watched this?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il cocked his head to the side. “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Are you stronger than this guy?” Yong-Joo asked eagerly.</p>
<p>Seong-Il watched the video Yong-Joo played and looked at Ki-Cheol. Tae-Han had once stated that it would be difficult to stop people spreading rumors about the suppression of monsters and prevent videos about them from being distributed on the Internet.</p>
<p>However, this was definitely a terrible video for middle school students to watch. Seong-Il got pissed at the person who distributed this clip, but he couldn’t reveal his rage as he was in front of Ki-Cheol and his friend.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head in disapproval. “This is too violent for you guys to watch. Erase it.”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo nodded obediently. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“You asked if I’m stronger than this guy, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“He seems to be in the early gold section, but Ki-Cheol. Which section am I in?”</p>
<p>“Challenger,” Ki-Cheol replied.</p>
<p>“Yes. Even if hundreds of people like this guy try to take me down at once, I can defeat them with one fist. Also, I'm not going to just sit around and watch them doing things like this. I will make the world where you guys live very peaceful, so don’t worry and just grow up healthy. Being smart doesn’t really help you live in this world. You will find a way to live in the end, so just stay healthy. Okay?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il looked at Ki-Cheol and Yong-Joo with eyes that glistened with something wet.</p>
<p>When Ki-Cheol and Yong-Joo left the room, Yong-Joo said in awe, “Damn, your dad is <em>dope</em>.”</p>
<p>When their voices faded away, Seong-Il's face hardened. People said the System had vanished, but no matter how many times he blinked, a message that resembled the one from the Stage of Advent was floating in his window.</p>
<p>[You have been appointed as one of the four priests of Doom Man.]</p>
<p>[Chief Priest: Lee Tae-Han</p>
<p>The Four Priests: Mary, the King of Hell, Osiris, Caliber]</p>
<p>[You have learned the ritual of the human corps ‘Transition.’]</p>
<p>[You have received a command from the Almighty Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>[Complete the ritual ‘Transition’ (Command)</p>
<p>The Battle between the Star Dragorin and the Seven Demon Kings' corps is coming to an end. There is not much time left until the human corps participate in the war. Get ready. The dungeons left by the Old One still remain on the mainland of the human corps. Through the ritual, you will have to move the exit of the dungeon toward the battlefield.</p>
<p>The ritual ‘Transition’ makes this possible.</p>
<p>Success: The exits of dungeons lead to the Star Dragorin. The user will acquire the ritual of human corps ‘Mammonism.’</p>
<p>Failure: Unknown]</p>
<p>“What the fuck is this…” he snarled.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 337</p>
<p>Upon arriving in Seoul, I received two calls that I couldn’t disregard. I put aside my plan to visit my parents and said, “Let’s make a U-turn to go to Ilsung Hotel.”</p>
<p>The taxi driver glanced at me in the rearview mirror, then replied with a smile, “Have you made an appointment? It’s a mess there right now. A Korean Awakened named Caliber is staying at that hotel, so everyone is there to see him.”</p>
<p>When I answered that I had made a reservation, the taxi driver increased the radio volume.</p>
<p>“This is a report about the current KOSPI market. As of 2:13 PM, the KOSPI index has hit 1273.90, experiencing a significant rise of 52.94 points from yesterday. The KOSPI began the day with a 12.33 point increase from the previous day, starting at 1233.29.</p>
<p>Despite being two weeks into the U.S.-led economic sanctions against China, the worldwide stock markets continue to soar. This afternoon’s announcement of the ‘Microchip Transplantation on Awakened’ plan by the World Awakened Association has alleviated concerns and is driving the surge in the market.</p>
<p>Moreover, stock prices of all affiliates, including Ilsung Group’s parent company, are…”</p>
<p>“Wow. Stockholders… I can hear investors getting lots of money, haha. Right?”</p>
<p>Taxi drivers often gauged a passenger’s social status based on their appearance, demeanor, and final destination, and this ability only improved as they got more experience. There was only one reason why he continued talking to me even though he knew that I didn’t want to talk. He clearly wanted advice from me about investing in stocks.</p>
<p>“It’s not too late. Even if you start investing now, you won’t lose money,” I finally said.</p>
<p>He responded enthusiastically, “Really? Some of my clients said that the stock market is at its peak right now, and that I will lose a lot if I get in right now. I guess you have a different viewpoint. Hahaha.”</p>
<p>I smiled slightly. “Buy it now and withdraw half of it when it reaches 2500 points.”</p>
<p>I didn’t know if the taxi driver would follow my advice or not.</p>
<p>As he mentioned, the Ilsung Hotel was quite chaotic as the press were camping out at the entrance. The security guards of the hotel were busy stopping broadcasting vehicles from entering, and this showed that the interview of the Awakened named Catalina was of little use.</p>
<p>I was escorted from the lobby to Seong-Il’s room. Boxes of empty soju bottles were stacked on one side, creating a stark contrast to the lavish room that cost thousands of dollars per night. In addition, there were soju bottles neatly placed on the table in front of the couch, where Seong-Il was sitting. The glass in front of him was also filled with soju instead of water. Seong-Il was venting his spite from the Stage of Advent with every sip of soju.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t drunk. After all, he could easily raise his level of drunkenness with just a small sip if he wanted to. In fact, he now had the capability to regulate his mental state, regardless of how much alcohol he consumed.</p>
<p>He greeted me, “Yo, you look so fancy in your suit. Did you finish what you were doing?”</p>
<p>“Did Ki-Cheol say nothing about all of these bottles?” I asked, raising an eyebrow.</p>
<p>He shrugged and took another sip. “He just complimented me that I’m a heavy drinker, hehe. It looks like he’s tried soju multiple times before. He is freaking young, but… that’s my fault.”</p>
<p>My lips quirked. “Kids learn from their parents, so parents should take the initiative and be role models.”</p>
<p>He waved a hand. “Yeah, so I’ll stop doing this from tomorrow. I’m going to quit drinking.”</p>
<p>“Oh yeah?” I said sarcastically.</p>
<p>He suddenly grinned. “Hehe. There is something Tae-Han gave me yesterday. Would you like some? I don’t like the taste, but it’s super expensive. So… I don’t want to waste it.”</p>
<p>I resisted the urge to roll my eyes. “Where is Ki-Cheol?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il gestured with his free hand. “He is hanging out with his friend in the pool. His friend’s name is Yong-Joo, and he is much better than me. Tae-Han took great care of me, and I really appreciate it.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il wasn’t aware of the fact that all the facilities in the area, including Ilsung Hotel, Department Store, and Duty Free Shops, were owned by the Jeonil Group. Although they still used their old branding, they had switched owners a long time ago.</p>
<p>When I sat on the couch, Seong-Il pushed toward me a piece of paper that had what he had prepared. He even wrote down the messages that had appeared on his notification window. They were the same as what I had heard from Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>He asked somewhat anxiously, “Do we have to start the Ritual now? It’s not a big deal with Mary since she lives close by. But the King of Hell and Osiris are the problems.”</p>
<p>I responded, “Let’s wait. I also called Mary to come.”</p>
<p>“To here?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Yes. Were you about to leave Ki-Cheol alone? It will take a few days.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il rubbed his nose with a touched look.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I wondered what the ritual ‘Mammonism’ was. It was clear that there was a difference in the rituals depending on Doom Man or the corps’ characteristics.</p>
<p>After relocating to my room on the same floor as Seong-Il’s, he visited me in my room accompanied by a young boy. The boy had a skinny build and a face shaped like an egg as if he inherited more of his physical traits from his mother rather than his father.</p>
<p>Seong-Il quickly said, “What are you doing? Introduce yourself. This is Odin.”</p>
<p>“H…Hi.. I’m…” he stuttered.</p>
<p>I interrupted. “You are Ki-Cheol, right?”</p>
<p>“...Yes.”</p>
<p>I said, “Your father endured the Stage of Advent only because he wanted to come back to see you, then he became one of the most powerful Awakened. Don’t forget what kind of man your father is.”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>I continued kindly, “Take good care of yourself. If something happens to you, your father will start a world war just to save you. You know what I’m saying, correct?”</p>
<p>His eyes became round. “Y… yes…”</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>He hesitated before finally asking, “But that coupon…”</p>
<p>I smiled slightly. “Think carefully when you use it.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il smiled as if he was embarrassed after sending Ki-Cheol back to his room.</p>
<p>“He is still a kid, haha,” he said.</p>
<p>I shrugged. “That’s only to you. He is all grown up since he is in eighth grade. By the way, I’m glad he doesn’t really look like you.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il guffawed. “Haha. You sound like you have raised a child before. When are you going to tell me the good news about Mary? I can’t wait to cut some steak at your wedding.”</p>
<p>Then, Yeon-Hee arrived without a guide from the hotel.</p>
<p>“Was that Ki-Cheol?” she asked curiously.</p>
<p>Seong-Il immediately responded, “Yes, noona.”</p>
<p>She smirked. “He looks like his mom, right? That’s a relief.”</p>
<p>“Why is everyone saying that? He does look like me! Well… a little bit. My face is good enough for a man,” he blustered towards the end.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled wickedly. “Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Sure about what?”</p>
<p>“Do you really think you are handsome?” she asked teasingly.</p>
<p>He huffed. “I’m not saying that I’m handsome, but my face is good enough for a real man. The girls in the bar all swooned when they saw me. They touched my thigh and chest every time.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee quirked an eyebrow. “I thought you were a good guy. Gosh, you even cheated on your ex?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il became flustered. “Hey, I’m talking about what happened after the divorce. Before that, I had always been loyal to my ex. Oh, I just asked Odin when you would feed me some steak at your wedding. When can I get the invitation, noona? I’m waiting for that day.”</p>
<p>“It has been less than a month since we came back, Seong-Il. You must have gotten used to the normal life here already.”</p>
<p>He grinned. “A glass of soju gives you a life lesson, and since I’ve guzzled down dozens of boxes, there is no need for an explanation. Hehe.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee rolled her eyes. “Ah, I’m going to get drunk just by smelling you. Doesn’t Ki-Cheol say anything about that?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il sighed. “Gosh, you guys are the same. If it were anyone else, they would have thought you guys had colluded beforehand. All you have to do is schedule the day.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il just winked at Yeon-Hee instead of answering. Yeon-Hee then looked at him and shook her head, but soon smiled brightly. She was genuinely happy. The Kciphos in her arms began to make strange noises.</p>
<p>Grrrrr.</p>
<p>Seong-Il suddenly asked, “By the way, is it okay for you to carry it around like that? I thought this hotel didn’t allow dogs. It’s such an expensive place.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That evening, Ji-Ae noona delivered information regarding Orca’s whereabouts. The Awakened had emptied out the hotel where they were initially relocated so Orca had moved to a suite at Jeonil Resort, which served as the headquarters of the association.</p>
<p>A photo sent by Ji-Ae through the messenger app depicted Orca’s new dwelling, and it resembled a monster’s den. Huge tentacles wriggled out of the broken window, providing a clear indication of the hideous state inside the room. After instructing Jamie to prevent anyone from accessing the area occupied by Orca, I pushed my smartphone aside.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee climbed on top of me as if she had been waiting. She said, “I’ve been waiting for so long. I didn’t know it would take two weeks when you left.”</p>
<p>“It’s not because you’ve been thirsty?” I smiled.</p>
<p>She slanted a look at me. “Hohoho. Then do you want to be eaten by a hungry monster?”</p>
<p>I cheekily responded, “No, I’m more thirsty for you.”</p>
<p>When I hugged her and put her to the side, she giggled in happiness.</p>
<p>Then, my smartphone rang again. There were only a few who had this number: my parents, Yeon-Hee, Seong-Il, Kim Cheong-Soo, Ji-Ae noona, Jamie, and a few more.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee crawled under the blanket and poked her head out. “It might be the King of Hell or Osiris.”</p>
<p>She was half right.</p>
<p>Jamie’s voice was filled with bewilderment.</p>
<p>As soon as I finished talking to her, I found the remote control and turned on the television. All the channels were focusing on Joshua and his squad members. Their arrival scene unfolded on the screen.</p>
<p>「[Breaking News] Joshua von Karjan, the Head of German Karjan Family and the Director of the World Awakened Association, Has Arrived in Korea.」</p>
<p>Joshua was undoubtedly wearing a necromancer robe, and only darkness filled the hood. Despite the cameras’ attempts to zoom in, the inside of the hood remained shrouded in an enigmatic blackness.</p>
<p>Moreover, his subordinates were wearing the same clothes as they did during the Stage of Advent. Their blood-stained equipment seemed to exude the stench of blood from the television. Their distorted faces and murderous eyes were threatening the cameras. This was why Jamie was flustered and the arrival gate was silent. It was obvious to everyone that the dark messenger had brought demons along with him.</p>
<p>“I’m reporter Lee Soo-Won. What made you suddenly come to Korea? Are you here to meet President Lee Tae-Han? Or is it because of the microchip?”</p>
<p>There was no sound other than the voice of a reporter shouting from a distance. A number of reporters crowded there, as much as the ones around Ilsung Hotel.</p>
<p>However, no one blocked Joshua and his people’s path. Instead, everyone unconsciously cleared a path for them to pass through. The scene was changed to a studio desk after they got on a black van. The newsreader seemed to have forgotten her duty for a moment. The director would have cued her, but five silent seconds passed before she finally got ahold of herself.</p>
<p>「[Breaking News] The Head of the Karjan Family Has Entered Korea with Other Awakened. 」</p>
<p>“We will now connect to the reporter who is out at the arrival gate. Reporter Park So-Yoon.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Joshua von Karjan, also known as Osiris, has just arrived. Then, he left without going through the press conference in a prepared vehicle.”</p>
<p>「[Breaking News] The Head of the Karjan Family Has Refused to Hold a Press Conference.」</p>
<p>“So, let’s delve a bit deeper into the recent arrival of the Head of the Karjan Family. The appearance of him and the Awakened forces under his command has certainly caught the attention of many, wouldn’t you agree?</p>
<p>And with the ongoing speculation about the whereabouts of the Karjan’s mysterious leader, the sudden emergence of a fully armed Karjan has definitely sparked a lot of questions. What are your thoughts on how we should approach and understand this in the current scenario?”</p>
<p>「[Breaking News] The Head of the Karjan Family is Equipped with Items to Cover His Face. The Awakened Under His Command were also Equipped with Items.」</p>
<p>“It is believed that he neutered the country as Osiris, the director of the World Awakened Association, rather than Joshua von Karjan, the head of the Karjan Family. Yesterday, the World Awakened Association had announced that they would implant microchips to the Awakened. The whole world is paying keen attention to whether his sudden entry will lead to a new phase or not.”</p>
<p>“Breaking news just in. Our sources have confirmed that Jonathan Hunter, the CEO of the prestigious Jonathan Investment Finance Group, who had been missing in action like Joshua von Karjan, has left the United States and arrived in Korea. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.”</p>
<p>「[Breaking News] Jonathan Hunter, the CEO of Jonathan Investment Finance Group, Joins the Journey to Korea.」</p>
<p>“Yes, the field press is raising concerns as they question the level of communication and transparency within the association regarding the controversial topic of microchip transplantation. With only two weeks remaining before the deadline for the registration of the Awakened, the public is eagerly awaiting a response from the association.”</p>
<p>“In other news, Korea is basking in pride as the World Awakened Association has chosen the country as the location for its headquarters. Furthermore, President Lee Tae-Han has been appointed as the president of the association, adding to Korea’s prestige…”</p>
<p>There was no need for me to watch anymore. The Four Priests of Doom Man were coming, so it was time for me to move.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 338</p>
<p>I originally planned to hold a meeting at the hotel out of consideration for Seong-Il, who was concerned about Ki-Cheol. However, Joshua had caught the public eye unexpectedly. Therefore, I had no choice but to move our venue.</p>
<p>We arrived at the headquarters of the World Awakened Association, which was previously known as Jeonil Resort, by helicopter.</p>
<p>“Umm… Dad…”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol pointed to the ground toward the entire building that was being occupied by Orca. When a giant tentacle suddenly soared through the air, the boy screamed briefly and then buried his face in Seong-Il’s arms like a child.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>The helicopter pilot was also taken aback as the aircraft briefly tilted in midair. The massive tentacle that had rapidly grown and was about to reach the helicopter then suddenly retreated back into the building before vanishing.</p>
<p>“See? Orca is helpful. It was a good idea that I gave him the entire building, right?” Yeon-Hee looked at the bizarre building where tentacles were shaking as if she adored them.</p>
<p>Seong-Il consoled his son, “It’s okay, Ki-Cheol. That monster is under our control.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Seong-Il. Orca is going to be sad if it hears you say that. Shush.” Yeon-Hee smirked.</p>
<p>“By the way… why do you keep talking to my dad as if he is younger than you? Aren’t you just in your thirties?” Ki-Cheol finally asked.</p>
<p>This was why the boy had looked at Yeon-Hee stiffly throughout the flight. Yeon-Hee couldn’t help but laugh at Ki-Cheol’s brave comment.</p>
<p>Seong-Il apologized, “Sorry, noona. Ki-Cheol is still a child.”</p>
<p>She chuckled. “All kids are like that. I’m more familiar with those in his age better than you, Seong-Il. Hey, Ki-Cheol. I’m not a noona to you. I’m your aunt because I’m older than your father. And stronger too. Does that answer your question?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>She continued, “I’ll be the one to fulfill your wish because I’m the top one.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol glanced at me.</p>
<p>She flapped a hand at me. “Excluding him of course.”</p>
<p>Anyway, Jeonil Resort had lost its previous beauty as it had been changed to the association’s general headquarters. The swimming pools were filled with dirt and covered with marble. The murals on the barriers, which had been created to prevent public criticism, were removed and surveillance cameras were attached to them, resembling the tentacles of Orca.</p>
<p>As the helicopter touched down on the roof, I could see that there were workers installing a fist-shaped stone statue in the spot where the Jeonil Group’s logo statue had been removed. The new statue appeared to be clutching the air.</p>
<p>All of this was to be expected. After all, I had originally created this place for the purpose of making it the association’s headquarters. It appeared the construction would proceed smoothly as expected and be finished before the registration day of the Awakened.</p>
<p>The lights that lit up the night stood out. It was still disordered with construction going on, but it would have been more unsettled when we first returned to earth. I was informed that the bereaved families of both Revolucion’s and Tomorrow’s Awakened had held a joint funeral at this location. Additionally, some survivors purposely avoided reuniting with their families.</p>
<p>One of the security chiefs approached the helicopter. He was a civilian, and he had the corporate mark of the military company Whitewater on his combat uniform. He was heavily armed with automatic firearms and had magazines in his vest.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to meet you. Please call me Benny.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol exclaimed loudly as if the disciplined mercenary looked more powerful than us.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It would be annoying if any novice reporters noticed us. They would write some nonsense about the armed foreign mercenaries while rambling on the sovereignty of the country. It was because a formal agreement with the U.N. had not yet been signed.</p>
<p>However, I had finished talking with the Blue House. They also believed that China, which was a permanent member of the United Nations, would soon declare it was surrendering and stamp the agreement. This was an area of extraterritorial jurisdiction, the real domain of the World Awakened Association.</p>
<p>Benny explained the progress so far. As one of the chief security officers, he would have realized that I was the top dog here as he was in charge of this place before and during the Day of Advent. He emphasized his accomplishments, which encompassed preventing infiltration attempts by the Korean CIA and foreign spies, as well as giving his subordinates their orders while we were flying toward here.</p>
<p>After a long explanation, he left while Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il came over.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee said, “It must be gold.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and we have to offer a bill as a sacrifice,” Seong-Il replied.</p>
<p>The notification message that the Four Priests received lacked specific details, but the two of them definitely felt how nervous I was about them, similar to how Doom Kaos was concerned about me. They said the altar was supposed to be made entirely of gold, and the sacrifice being offered should consist of valuable bills, whether in dollars, won, yen, euros, or any other high-value currency.</p>
<p>None of this was funny to me. Rather, I became fearful. Doom Kaos had perfectly figured out what was valuable to me and humanity as a hold, and it was what motivated us normally. Seong-Il said a glass of soju embodied life, but in reality, a single piece of paper symbolized the collective anguish and yearning of humanity.</p>
<p>Money drove our world, and Doom Kaos was aware of it. Maybe he had grasped it from my nature.</p>
<p>Anyway, Joshua arrived two hours later.</p>
<p>He announced, “I was cleaning up the house, Master.”</p>
<p>Jonathan arrived the next day. Then, the construction of the altar room was completed after another four days. The golden room was connected to the secret passages and security devices deep inside the headquarters, where construction was still in full swing.</p>
<p>It wasn’t merely covered with thin gold foil. In fact, actual gold bars made up the walls, floor, and ceiling on all sides.</p>
<p>We, the Awakened, didn’t need any lighting as we could all see the golden color hidden in the dark. The altar was located on the front wall.</p>
<p>“Excuse us.”</p>
<p>The four priests began to stack piles of bags filled with money. I didn’t need to be there, but I wanted to see everything in person. One interesting fact was that all of the money contributed came from the priests’ personal funds.</p>
<p>Jonathan personally withdrew some funds from his account, while Yeon-Hee used some of the money she had earned while adventuring with me in the dungeons. Seong-Il’s contribution was the lowest as he had spent a portion of the two hundred thousand dollars he had received from the World Awakened Association to enter the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>This was the requirement for the Doom Man priests’ offerings. It was said that I shouldn’t be paying for any of it, which meant a lot.</p>
<p>“This is the end of preparation. All that’s left is the ritual… But I’m not sure if it will end before the registration day of Awakened,” Yeon-Hee said with a nervous look.</p>
<p>I nodded to them, then stepped back toward the entrance. Starting with Yeon-Hee, they kneeled toward the altar. There were no spells or specific ceremonial procedures.</p>
<p>However, the tension that filled the narrow space sealed with gold was palpable. Then, the bags of money placed on the altar suddenly burst into flames. Right then, I heard voices from every direction. I knew these weren't auditory hallucinations.</p>
<p>Hehehe-</p>
<p>The sound of a woman laughing.</p>
<p>Waaaah-</p>
<p>The sound of a man crying.</p>
<p>Aaaaargh-</p>
<p>The sound of an old guy screaming.</p>
<p>At that point, mixed voices of various genders and ages started to echo. It all originated from the altar as the priests were kneeling in silence. It didn’t take long before I realized that the sounds were a collection of all kinds of emotions. They wound around the room and didn’t stop.</p>
<p>When the weeping intensified, I grew sentimental. The sound of mirth made the corners of my lips turn up at the edges, whereas the scream was so agonizing that I physically felt the pain.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>My people were being exposed to this vortex of intense emotion, and no one knew when this would end.</p>
<p>[Your priests are performing the ritual ‘Transition.’]</p>
<p>[Save your Power to respond to their wishes.]</p>
<p>I walked out of the altar with heavy strides. However, this reminded me that I had an ongoing task just as they had their own.</p>
<p>The war against China was ongoing, and they would have felt the urgency after receiving the agreement by now. They would move soon.</p>
<p>I sent a message to Kim Cheong-Soo.</p>
<p>「Be ready to attack.」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The State Council of the People’s Republic of China.</p>
<p>Certain items were accessible within the national market, while others were not. For instance, certain medications were not obtainable inside China, and the Minister of Finance cited Iraq during the 1990s in order to exert pressure on international human rights groups. He warned them that imposing economic sanctions on their country could lead to casualties and constitute a severe human rights issue.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“How the hell are you doing your job?!”</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance threw his cell phone at his subordinate’s face, and the guy squeaked in response.</p>
<p>His subordinate apologized profusely, “I’m so sorry. The human rights groups seem to have agreed to focus only on implanting microchips to Awakened.”</p>
<p>“How should I report this to our leader?” the Minister of Finance snarled.</p>
<p>If economic sanctions against China were accepted as ‘unhumanitarian measures’ by the international human rights groups, then they could have turned the tide from there.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>The subordinate couldn’t afford to deal with his bleeding nose because he had one more piece of sad news to report. The entire State Council was confused by the agreement that had been informed in advance by the United Nations.</p>
<p>「 Agreement Between the World Awakened Association and the United Nations About the Members’ Status 」</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance became speechless after reading through the documents, then he looked at the subordinate with shaky eyes. Then, there was an unbelievable answer.</p>
<p>The world was becoming crazier and crazier. The way they declared the end of diplomatic relations with China was frantic, but this agreement was even madder.</p>
<p>However, the leaders of the world, as well as their elite supporters, weren’t all irrational. The only explanation for their behavior was that a dominant force was manipulating them from behind the scenes.</p>
<p>“If we, the People’s Republic of China, don’t accept this, each country will…”</p>
<p>“Each country!”</p>
<p>“Each country will make its own agreement with the World Awakened Association before the registration day of Awakened.”</p>
<p>After receiving a response from his subordinate, the Minister of Finance was convinced that a force existed that had the ability to influence the entire world, even in situations where the United Nations was unable to resolve the issues at hand.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t assume that the power was the Bilderberg Club because they wouldn’t be able to manage oil-producing countries and Russia.</p>
<p>This power is much stronger than the Bilderberg…</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance suddenly became overwhelmed by a huge unknown force. A chill rushed up his spine, and goosebumps appeared on his skin. The anger that had previously soared up quickly dissipated.</p>
<p>Then, he met the leader, who had the same expression as he had after reading the agreement, in the hallway. Surprisingly, the leader had reached the same conclusion.</p>
<p>“Minister of Finance… I don’t think it’s the Bilderberg Club.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“I can’t believe our insight into this was this narrow. We were big fish in a small pond.”</p>
<p>All the Awakened feared Odin. Since he possessed the strength of a deity, his force would have exceeded even the powerful entity that drove the world at the moment.</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance looked at the ground and thought, ‘It’s definitely not the Bilderberg Club.’</p>
<p>“So we have no choice but to dig up the dirt around the pond to expand it. Can you do that right away?”</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance raised his head in surprise.</p>
<p>“This is a good lesson for us. We should name the operation ‘Golden Fish.’ Let’s start all over again. What do you think?”</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance inwardly freaked out as the collapse of China was inevitable along with the downfall of the global economy.</p>
<p>His only hope was that he and his family wouldn’t be purged. Also, he saw the light because the leader was spending time with him instead of the members of a standing committee, including…</p>
<p>… the Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister of Economic Affairs, President of the National People’s Political Consultative Conference, Secretary of the Central Organization and Discipline Inspection Committee, Director of the Central Office and Standing Committee of the National People’s Congress…</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance’s unsettled thoughts became resolute.</p>
<p>“You are right.”</p>
<p>The leader was right. If he became a fish in a pond, he would have no other option but to excavate the surrounding soil to enlarge it, even if doing so meant risking his life.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 339</p>
<p>Sabina was a strikingly beautiful woman. In fact, her beauty never paled in comparison to Catalina’s, even when the spotlight was on the other woman.</p>
<p>「I will see you there.」</p>
<p>She got up after receiving the message. She kissed the forehead of a conservative U.S. politician sleeping next to her and left as if she was Cinderella at midnight.</p>
<p>Her face froze when she got out of the shabby motel due to the current grave atmosphere of the world. It had been four years since she had entered the U.S. on a study visa. She actually received a master’s degree in international relations from a graduate school in Washington and established a small organization among her colleagues.</p>
<p>However, this was all a disguise. The truth was that she was a Chinese spy! The way she looked around resembled the sharp eyes of the Awakened. Fortunately, there was no one tailing her.</p>
<p>Sabina moved to the contact point while thinking that the Chinese authorities were overtaxing themselves. Hastening in this manner would inevitably exacerbate the situation.</p>
<p>In fact, engaging in any wrongdoing could result in her prosecution under the Foreign Agent Registration Act (FARA) for failing to register with the U.S. government while working for a foreign country. Considering the present political climate, the prospect of a spy exchange between China and the U.S. seemed far-fetched, especially if she was revealed to be a spy.</p>
<p>“If we keep doing this, this will only raise suspicions. Do you know who I was with?”</p>
<p>Sabina was simply nervous. She needed a good night’s sleep as she always had to maintain her looks, but she had been suffering from insomnia recently. China’s relations with the U.S. had deteriorated to an extreme. No bullets had been fired, but it was a war.</p>
<p>Sabina was nervous when she looked at her silent contact. Then, the contact handed her an envelope. Sabina froze as she noticed the envelope was red. That meant Code Red! The worst-case scenario was actually happening, and the Chinese government was unsheathing the sword.</p>
<p>“...Is this true?” she asked.</p>
<p>The contact only nodded. After he left, Sabina was afraid to open the envelope because she felt like a nuclear bomb would explode as soon as she did that. Code Red was full of missions that marked the start of World War III, including nuclear attacks and data system paralysis.</p>
<p>Of course, she was a mere intermediary like the man who had delivered the envelope, but that didn’t ease her mind. Thanks to the Awakened, Earth had barely averted an assault by extraterrestrial creatures, but now the world and China were engaged in a war without bullets that was rapidly approaching its conclusion.</p>
<p>Sabina opened the envelope with trembling hands. A map appeared.</p>
<p>After following the directions, she arrived at a place disguised as a pedicure shop. It was full of computers and whiteboards. Sabina wasn’t quite sure what was going on when she got there because people there didn’t appear to be hackers or soldiers. Rather, the place felt familiar to her.</p>
<p>A man asked her, “Are you familiar with the chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX), Sabina?”</p>
<p>Sabina nodded because he was among the people she had to seduce. “Yes, but I still don’t know who you are.”</p>
<p>“I’m Mickey Chung,” the man responded.</p>
<p>Sabina scanned Mickey from head to toe. He was clad in a fine suit and with impeccably styled hair, so he exuded the typical image of the Wall Street elite. As expected, he told her that he was running a hedge fund.</p>
<p>“Where is this?” Sabrina asked.</p>
<p>“I’m developing a cannonball. I completed it a long time ago, so all we have left is checking some stuff.”</p>
<p>All she could hear was the clicking of a keyboard, and there was no hint of gunpowder in the air.</p>
<p>People were speaking in raised voices at some tables, engaging in discussions about financial data using technical terms specific to the industry.</p>
<p>Sabina said, “It looks like my job is to connect you to the chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange.”</p>
<p>She had to remember that this mission corresponded to Code Red, so she shouldn’t be prematurely relieved that it wasn’t a nuclear attack. Instead, they would attack the U.S. mainland with something equivalent, and Mickey Chung likened it to a ‘cannonball.’</p>
<p>Sabina focused on her surroundings and the sounds of the meeting, then soon realized that it was a war of money! The Chinese authorities were risking both the fate and the power of their nation!</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p>“Come this way.”</p>
<p>Mickey guided Sabina to the office, then he said, “There are a few things you need to know in order to connect me to the chairman. I will briefly tell you the basic framework. Before we get into that, how much do you know about the subprime crisis in 2008?”</p>
<p>She promptly responded, “That since then, Jonathan Investment Finance Group has become more prominent.”</p>
<p>“Then, I can just explain it like this and move on. Wall Street geniuses were good at beautifully wrapping up dangerous waste. They finally created the evil species by combining and twisting everything.”</p>
<p>Sabina interjected, “Then, the Rothschilds swallowed it all.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, that complicated mechanism has inspired us all. Hence, ‘Small Golden Fish’ was born that way.”</p>
<p>“A small golden fish?”</p>
<p>Mickey shrugged. “The authorities gave it that name. It doesn’t matter.”</p>
<p>Sabina concentrated on Mickey’s explanation. Despite possessing fundamental financial knowledge, she struggled to comprehend the intricate structure of Small Golden Fish as Mickey expounded on it with professional expertise. The extent she understood was that a derivative named Small Golden Fish was closely linked to gold and the renminbi[1].</p>
<p>“It’s difficult.”</p>
<p>“While it is indeed true that the dollar has lost its position as the world’s dominant currency, it has been enjoying its heyday since the Day of Advent. What do you think will happen if the dollar collapses now? The entire world would be unable to avoid fallout.”</p>
<p>“Then, even our nation will…”</p>
<p>Mickey nodded calmly. “The People’s Republic of China will also have a fallout.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Fuck! This is crazy! This is crazier than what the entire world is doing to China!</p>
<p>Mickey shouted inwardly after meeting with the chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange after Sabina introduced him. In fact, Mickey, who had hoped that Small Golden Fish would go down in smoke, couldn’t hide his disappointment. The chairman affirmed that he would release Small Golden Fish into the market, as though Sabina had exploited his weakness and seduced him.</p>
<p>This world has barely managed to survive! But this means nothing matters as long as they maintain their power! But what about our people? My family? And me?</p>
<p>Mickey swallowed his anger. For now, he thought it was a priority to get Sabina’s eyes off of him. Of course, he put in effort to help her realize the seriousness of the situation, but she valued her own life more than the collapse of the global economy.</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have expected anything.</p>
<p>He smiled at Sabina without revealing that his mind was going crazy.</p>
<p>Sabina answered with a smile, “I’m glad the conversation worked out well.”</p>
<p>“But Sabina… Don’t you want to make a fortune? As a person who handles money, I won’t be able to close my eyes when I die if I miss this opportunity.”</p>
<p>“It sounds like you are going to use the authorities’ tactics.”</p>
<p>“It won’t be a big deal if you turn a blind eye. I can guarantee at least ten million dollars. Of course, I will exchange the dollar in spots before it turns into a worthless piece of paper. We will share the profit exactly half and half.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>He continued, “Let’s let the higher-ups take power, and let’s share some money.”</p>
<p>Sabina hesitated and finally said, “...What is the plan?”</p>
<p>“The government will notice if I intervene myself. However, I have a friend. He was successful even in the midst of two global economic crises, including the subprime and the Day of Advent. We can hand him the investment proposal and just wait.”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Jonathan Hunter?” she asked.</p>
<p>Sabina had managed to alleviate her tension to the extent that she could make jokes.</p>
<p>“He is Chris Lee.”</p>
<p>“This is my number. I’ll be waiting for your call,” Sabrina said.</p>
<p>Mickey headed straight to Chris’s office which was close by. The world was in a great economic boom. The rally was just in the beginning phase, so it was too early to predict the end. Chris’s office was full of joy like any other office on Wall Street.</p>
<p>Chris was having a meeting with a man when Mickey arrived there. Mickey didn’t pay much attention to that. However, once something colorful flashed from the man’s hand beyond the window, Mickey realized that the man was one of the Awakened. Then, he saw them exchanging documents and shaking hands.</p>
<p>More time passed.</p>
<p>The office door finally opened, and Mickey couldn’t bear to make eye contact with the Awakened. Media censorship alone was inadequate in concealing the problems that the Awakened had caused in the private sector, so Mickey was aware of several incidents too.</p>
<p>“Mickey?” Chris continued to speak while Mickey stared at the Awakened’s back. “I was expanding my business. I had something to talk to you about, and you came just in time. Come on in.”</p>
<p>Mickey momentarily forgot his purpose for coming. He pondered what kind of business venture had motivated Chris to bring along such a dangerous Awakened.</p>
<p>Chris clarified, “The formal contract will be made after the registration day of the Awakened.”</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Mickey asked.</p>
<p>“We are in a hurry because we have to enter before military law gets strengthened. Simply put, it’s similar to management.”</p>
<p>Management? Managing the Awakened?</p>
<p>Mickey shuddered at Chirs’s audacity because he wasn’t a guy like this. He had an excellent success rate in the market as a person who ran a successful hedge fund.</p>
<p>However, he changed from the Day of Advent. When everyone, like friends, colleagues, and rivals, in the industry, was busy disposing of their assets, Chris instead jumped into the ranks of defenders. Then, he became a passionate believer in two financial conglomerates, Jonathan and Gillian.</p>
<p>In fact, that was why Mickey was visiting Chris. Mickey thought Chris would take his situation boldly and help him out.</p>
<p>Chris said, “Why didn’t you answer my call? I was very worried, thinking that you had gone back to China.”</p>
<p>Mickey grimaced. “Even if I try to go back, I can’t. The important matter…”</p>
<p>“Did it go well?”</p>
<p>“It was a project that I’ve been in charge of for a long time, and I just finished it.”</p>
<p>“Please take a seat first.”</p>
<p>Mickey sat on the couch where the Awakened used to sit. Chris opened his mouth while Mickey was trying to figure out how to start the conversation.</p>
<p>“I don’t have many people to trust, so I have been only waiting for your call. There’s no time to rest now. The market targeting the Awakened is rapidly forming, so we should jump in faster than others.”</p>
<p>Mickey found himself envious of Chirs’s gleaming eyes, and he unwittingly fixated on them for an extended period.</p>
<p>Chris’s voice broke through, “Are you okay? Whatever it is, don’t hesitate to tell me, Mickey.”</p>
<p>“...There is something I haven’t been able to tell you.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Mickey confessed, “I’m from China.”</p>
<p>“Yes, so?”</p>
<p>Mickey continued nervously, “I… I was working for the Chinese authorities. Please help me. I beg you, Chris. Please connect me with the U.S. government and Jonathan Investment Finance Group.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“The Chinese government is trying to self-destruct with the world. Please protect me and my family. Please,” he begged.</p>
<p>That night, Mickey received a phone call. It was an unfamiliar number that wasn’t registered on his phone.</p>
<p>It was Brian Kim, the Chief Financial Manager of Jonathan Group! The vanguard of the Great Financial Empire!</p>
<p>Mickey became speechless for a few minutes, then he started brooding over Brian Kim’s determined words.</p>
<p>“Yes… You guys… are… Jonathan Group…”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was a thing called the IMF special withdrawal right (SDR). Aside from the role of managing it, it was important to note that the constituent currencies of the SDR played a vital role in the world economy as a global currency. Until 2016, there were only four: dollars, euros, pounds, and yen.</p>
<p>However, China’s renminbi was then added, so one could argue that the dollar was the party venue while the other four currencies were guests. Basically, one party drove the world economy.</p>
<p>There was a reason why the renminbi was able to occupy such a significant position. When Yeon-Hee and I were wandering around nonstop, the renminbi issue also emerged in our club. It started after one of the club members, the IMF chairman, complained that pressure was growing in China.</p>
<p>China desperately desired to integrate the renminbi into the currency party that governed the global economy, asserting that their significant growth warranted recognition from the world. They even threatened to divulge the number of gold reserves they possessed to the world unless the global economy accepted the renminbi as a party member.</p>
<p>Of course, China’s intimidation didn’t work at the time. Why? Because they would never reveal the number of gold reserves they held to the public. They didn’t want the international gold market to falter as much as we did.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we invited the renminbi as a party member under the dollar. Why? Because it not only benefited us but there was also another important reason to comfort China. We had to use either force or somehow convince them not to use nuclear power arbitrarily on the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>“I think it’s the beginning of the Big Golden Fish.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo’s voice boomed from the speaker, while at the bottom of the screen, the breaking news headlines continued to scroll on the Internet news feed.</p>
<p>「 Breaking news: China’s Deputy Prime Minister of Economic Affairs, “The authorities’ gold reserves are more than fifteen thousand tons. Number one in the world.” 」</p>
<p>「 Breaking news: China’s Reconstruction Movement Began, Similar to Korea’s IMF Gold Collection Campaign in 1997. 」</p>
<p>「 Breaking news: International Gold Prices Soar in the Wake of China’s Remark. Global Stocks Turn to Decline.」</p>
<p>The briefing that China’s Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs gave to the world was as intense as Lee Tae-Han’s press conference.</p>
<p>「 Is Renminbi’s Inclusion in the Currency Party a Prelude to a Gold-based Currency Promotion? The Future of the World’s Dominant Currency, the Dollar, Remains Uncertain.</p>

<p>「 Whose hand will the Big Four, the Financial Empire, Raise? The United States or China?</p>
<p>- Is Jonathan Hunter a Financier or an Awakened? 」</p>
<p>The world was becoming clamorous again. 2018 would be remembered as the most dramatic year in recorded history.</p>
<p>“Things are going as you said. Then, I’ll contact the club members.”</p>
<p>I commanded, “Tell them that any seceders will face the same fate as China.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>I accepted the currency war. Breaking into the People’s Bank of China and stealing their gold didn’t exist in the future I was drawing. Without resorting to extreme measures, I could easily crush the small and big fish with my financial power and claim the valuable rewards that awaited me.</p>
<p>Yes. I had relied on the past so far, but now was the moment for me to create my own history.</p>
<p>Welcome to the history that I will be making.</p>
<p>1. The official currency of China. ☜</p>

<p>Chapter 340</p>
<p>The Rothschild’s main mansion.</p>
<p>It must have been decades for Odin.</p>
<p>However, it had been less than a month for Dresner. He risked his family’s fate on the Day of Advent even though Odin had warned him not to do anything stupid. Nevertheless, it seemed to be his last chance to restore the old glory of his family. During that time, many financial forces were busy disposing of their assets despite the club’s determination.</p>
<p>Anyway, joining Odin’s side to form a defensive line ahead of other financial entities on that day turned out to be a wise choice. When other forces saw that Odin’s defense was holding strong, they started joining him. On the other hand, Dresner’s family had been with him from the outset, and though the journey was difficult, the outcome was immensely satisfying.</p>
<p>His family was getting closer to their old glory. Then, he received a call from Jonathan Investment Finance Group.</p>
<p>Only the caller had changed from Odin to Brian Kim, and they basically talked about the same thing. It was a direct threat that if Rothschilds went against Odin, then they would go to hell with China.</p>
<p>Dresner chuckled hopelessly after putting down the phone. The current state of the Rothschilds was so dire that even threats from one of Odin’s subordinates, not Odin himself, didn’t provoke any anger. This starkly proved just how far the Rothschild Family had fallen in the past decade.</p>
<p>Dresner had believed that Odin held some fondness for him and that, through the Day of Advent, he had been able to recover some of his family’s assets. However, it appeared that the Rothschilds were still being looked down upon.</p>
<p>He turned his head to where Kubera[1] was devouring financial books and magazines. His real name was Samuel Rothschild, but he insisted on being called ‘Kubera,’ one of the gods of Indian mythology. Therefore, Dresner called him that way.</p>
<p>“Kubera, that was from the club.”</p>
<p>Kubera didn’t take his eyes off the book, then nodded.</p>
<p>“As you can see, this is the reality of my family. You must be very disappointed.”</p>
<p>Kubera closed the book and looked up at Dresner.</p>
<p>“Wasn’t it obvious that our family’s situation was getting worse from 2008? It was a great decision to participate as a defender on the Day of Advent. I wouldn’t have done that either.”</p>
<p>Dresner grimaced. “Thank you for saying that.”</p>
<p>“I mean it. I would never be able to wag my tail after getting screwed by them. I’m not a dog.”</p>
<p>Dresner offered a feeble smile in response. He thought it was pointless and absurd to tell Kubera that they were in the same predicament.</p>
<p>Kubera continued while Dresner stayed quiet, “Just like China, we should have let the world collapse. If the situation remains unchanged, then the Rothschilds will be forever bound to Odin’s control, down through the generations. We are slaves in all but name.”</p>
<p>Despite being the one who mentioned the slave label, Kubera frowned as he thought about the microchip that was soon to be implanted in the Awakened.</p>
<p>Fucking microchips.</p>
<p>It was only a matter of days before that damn device would be injected into his skin.</p>
<p>“I just realized that you have endured a difficult time. We should have let the world go to ruin? Hahahaha. It seems you have not fully grasped the situation yet. Take your time. I won’t rush you.”</p>
<p>Dresner added, “Look. Odin’s defensive line didn’t even budge a little. They were like a black hole as they devoured everything that was being sold in the market. We were fortunate that we entered the line before the other forces as we could recover a bit. Do you know how long Odin had been preparing for the Day of Advent? Don’t doubt it. He was born a financier. He hopes the current order will be maintained.”</p>
<p>Kubera nodded on that point.</p>
<p>The only reason China endured the turmoil was because of gold. China was the world’s largest producer and consumer of gold, so the government encouraged its citizens to stockpile the precious metal. They also stored the gold they imported from other countries, essentially acquiring and mining gold solely for the purpose of hoarding it.</p>
<p>With their substantial reserves of gold serving as their weapons, China was even daring to take the hegemony of the world. All the other countries had to do was to seize their gold.</p>
<p>However, Odin didn’t do it. Kubera was unhappy, as it was clear what would inevitably happen if China, which had the hegemony, was suppressed by the world. There would be a slow trickling of forces starting in China and eventually happening in Europe, Asia, and America, marking the beginning of the world of the Awakened.</p>
<p>What exactly was the Day of Advent, and what did the Awakened learn and gain from there? They learned how to exert control and prepared themselves to seize power in their homeland.</p>
<p>However, Odin’s move was quite the opposite. He announced that Awakened would go into outer space and instead made the Awakened slaves. Although there were efforts to let Awakened live an extraterritorial life, Odin’s move was definitely not like the Awakened.</p>
<p>Well… Odin had no motivation to conquer the world by force since he already held mastery over it. Additionally, he had a deity to address the grievances of the Awakened.</p>
<p>Kubera had a burning sensation in his stomach. Dresner said to Kubera’s stiffened face, “So you, Awakened, will have to get used to Odin’s order. Odin wants you guys to be incorporated into capitalism.”</p>
<p>“That’s why you are still alive,” Kubera snapped.</p>
<p>Dresner laughed. “I can’t take care of all my blood relatives. Some I wish to protect, while others hold little importance to me.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“You have likely been privy to all the privileges of the family. Reflecting on the past serves no purpose. What is important is what lies ahead, like tomorrow. If you cannot understand this, then I see no need to spend any further time with you.”</p>
<p>“So what are you going to do now?” Kubera asked.</p>
<p>Dresner shrugged. “China’s gold standard will fail. They would have succeeded if they waited a few more years. Well, of course, Odin wouldn’t have stood by for that either. Anyway, China’s gold standard will soon push its economy to the brink. But do you think China is still carrying it out because they don’t know about it?”</p>
<p>“You love to ask a lot of questions. I think I already answered that,” Kubera answered insensitively.</p>
<p>Dresner smiled. “Yes, they are trying to co-destruct by using their economy as a suicide bomb and exploding themselves against the dollar or whatever.”</p>
<p>Dresner moved in front of Kubera. Although Kubera’s eyes glittered with murderous intention, Dresner wasn’t afraid of him. Kubera comprehended and attempted to follow Odin’s rule. In order for Kubera to wield the same level of power as he had during the Day of Advent under Odin’s orders, he needed to ally with the Rothschild. With the same blood!</p>
<p>“Then what are you thinking about?” Kubera asked the face that was staring at him fearlessly.</p>
<p>“Where did all the assets that were liquidated during the Day of Advent end up? Gold. The notorious elites are among those who possess it. If Russia and these families collaborate and push for more gold, then China will conclude that their gold standard would be effective.”</p>
<p>“That’s interesting.”</p>
<p>This meant the world could be reorganized into a China-centered order. Which one would gain public confidence? The renminbi that could be converted into dollars? Or the dollar that could be printed indefinitely on a computer?</p>
<p>If China’s gold standard were to succeed, then the dollar would no longer be able to maintain its status as the primary currency, ending the era of ‘bring dollars if you want to purchase oil.’</p>
<p>“Oil is being traded in dollars now, but if a currency that could be converted into gold appears, then that order will be broken.”</p>
<p>Dresner indulged in reminiscence after finishing what he had to say. During the time of his education as the heir to a family with a history of consolidating world power into the dollar, he had to memorize the reasons why a select few families were able to dominate the world.</p>
<p>His family was great at the time as they shared the U.S. Central Bank with a few other families and printed dollars at their will. They were more reckless since the gold standard had been abolished.</p>
<p>However, it was all in the past. The U.S. Central Bank was now in Odin’s hands, and dollars had become his exclusive possession.</p>
<p>He ended his thoughts there as Kubera sarcastically interjected, “Why? It’s getting interesting, so keep going. You stopped after saying that you could betray Odin.”</p>
<p>“Odin gathered Russia and the elites before things happened to warn them. Then, he also warned them right before everything began.”</p>
<p>Kubera barked out a laugh. “Heh heh. But you still want to betray him? Amazing, man. This is amazing.”</p>
<p>“You must have really lost your touch. I’m talking about the greatness of gold.”</p>
<p>“...?”</p>
<p>“Odin is holding a knife in one hand and money in the other. I can’t think of a way to knock down his knife, but gold is the way to cut off his hand that holds the money. Have the Awakened really stopped growing?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Mmm…”</p>
<p>“Go on.”</p>
<p>“I’m going to risk our family’s destiny this time just as I have done on the Day of Advent. I will put everything to be with Odin.”</p>
<p>“Gold?”</p>
<p>Dresner nodded. “Exactly. Our family will also pillage China’s gold. We will amass gold and wait until our family’s primary source of power becomes gold. It’s my responsibility to gather gold, so I need you to gather the swords. This is also something that Odin advises, so there’s no need to be concerned.”</p>
<p>“Heh heh. Do you think that’s enough?” Kubera asked.</p>
<p>“I know it’s not, but I heard the last moment was very short, wasn’t it? The majority of the Awakened had no choice but to be massacred unilaterally on the stage. But after all, Odin is also a human like you and me.”</p>
<p>“Those who had mistakenly thought so also died the fastest. It’s a shame when I think about it after coming this far. Our conversation would have been much better if you were an Awakened too.”</p>
<p>Dresner remarked, “You also worship Odin like god.”</p>
<p>Kubera grimaced. “He is the devil. The absolute demon.”</p>
<p>“So collect the knives and look for the devil’s kryptonite[2].”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I think it’s better to look for his relationship with others first.”</p>
<p>Kubera was impressed by Dresner due to the presence of a traitorous usurper hiding behind a clown’s disguise. Such individuals were destined to become leaders during the Stage of Advent. Kubera was uncertain, but he believed that if Dresner had been Awakened, he would have been among the thirty seat holders.</p>
<p>Dresner made his last statement, “Start with his family.”</p>

<p>Chapter 341</p>
<p>China had outlined its position on the gold standard for the renminbi. They basically stated that if the world assigned the renminbi as the global currency, then they would convert other countries’ money into gold at any time.</p>
<p>This was why the value of gold now surpassed its previous high from the Day of Advent, as even ants started selling off their stocks. The media made a fuss that global hegemony had been handed over to China, and the global public were now paying attention to the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX).</p>
<p>The link between gold and the renminbi was tightly intertwined, and numerous derivative products were intricately connected. This led to a vast amount of documentation on these products, which could make up a thick book. Even I found it difficult to comprehend, as the situation was caused by the extensive efforts of Chinese financial engineers. I wondered how many of them would actually have a complete understanding of it.</p>
<p>They called the derivatives ‘Small Golden Fish.’ A ticking bomb was attached to the small fish, and China was waiting for the right moment to detonate it. They would do so when the dollar and other global currencies reached a point of no return. At that moment, the renminbi would rise to prominence as the world’s dominant currency.</p>
<p>Then, the Chinese would brazenly say, “Despite our best efforts, the gold standard was abolished.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>After pulling the trigger, renminbi would turn into pieces of useless paper and the derivatives that had inflated to an extreme would become more worthless than the renminbi and get stuck to the ground.</p>
<p>Bang! Bang!</p>
<p>At that point, all currencies would become rubbish, and the global economy would be plunged into a bottomless pit that nobody could touch. That was the Chinese authorities’ plan.</p>
<p>It sounded scary, but China’s lack of awareness that the war would end even before reaching that phase would lead to their significant defeat. If they called this operation ‘Golden Fish,’ then we would call it ‘Blitzkrieg[1].’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We moved, and the Jonathan Group’s headquarters guide pretended she knew me personally.</p>
<p>“Ethan! It’s so nice to see you in good shape. But have you not heard the news? The CEO is in Korea.”</p>
<p>“I’m here to see Brian Kim,” I replied.</p>
<p>A moment later, Kim Cheong-Soo greeted me with a puzzled look on his face because I had just talked to him through facetime minutes ago. Thanks to Jonathan’s returning stone, I managed to arrive in New York within a few seconds.</p>
<p>Anyway, the employees at the headquarters were exhausted since many things had happened over the past month. Energy drinks were piled up on each table, and many were taking illegal stimulants for the money and the sake of their current job.</p>
<p>The same went for Kim Cheong-Soo as I sensed a fabricated liveliness in him. His energy was being artificially induced by drugs. When I arrived at his office, I found a portable medicine case full of pills. He followed my gaze and asked without shame, “Is it true that the Awakened don’t need to sleep?”</p>
<p>I responded, “The duration we can stay awake varies by section, and it’s important for us to also get some sleep.”</p>
<p>He remarked enviously, “Hmm, let’s imagine what would it have been like if I was Awakened.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “Then, you wouldn’t have been here. One of my aides is Kwon Seong-Il.”</p>
<p>“You are talking about Caliber, right?”</p>
<p>I nodded. “That’s right. He wields people like weapons, but you do that with money. There is no need for you to envy the Awakened because you are stronger than most of them.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for saying that.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo’s chair had been warmed through him sitting longer enough to now be classified as ‘hot.’ With six monitors on his desk, each displaying four open windows, it was evident that he was in full control of the battlefield.</p>
<p>I expanded the New York Mercantile Exchange website, which was one of the battlegrounds. Enormous transactions were taking place that were beyond the usual scope. The incessantly soaring trading volume suggested that all the capital that could be mobilized around the world was being concentrated there. The funds from Big Four, including Jonathan Group, were pouring in there.</p>
<p>I commented, “China must be smiling now without knowing what is about to happen.”</p>
<p>That was true. They might have assumed that we would only transfer funds from the Big Four, without taking into account those from the paper companies.</p>
<p>“How long does it take to digest everything?” I asked.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo responded, “At this rate, I think we will have a strand in an hour.”</p>
<p>“What’s the dollar trend?”</p>
<p>As China had played its gold standard card, the race was on for speed. The longer we delayed, the more the value of the dollar would diminish.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo continued, “It’s still on the decline, but I’ve done the calculations. I can finish this by the end of today.”</p>
<p>“Okay. You said they are baby fish, right?”</p>
<p>He nodded. “Yes.”</p>
<p>I grinned. “Take them all in. We will start cooking after that.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Hahahahaha-!”</p>
<p>China’s Minister of Finance cried out in joy as the little golden fish were swimming wild. His plan was going smoothly. The country had successfully released the fish on the New York Mercantile Exchange and drawn the world’s attention to them. Since then, torrents had been swirling in accordance with the physiology of the capital market.</p>
<p>He shouted at the monitor, “Yes. Yes! It has to be like this! This is the capitalism that you can’t live without!”</p>
<p>The vast trading volume on the New York Mercantile Exchange exemplified the nature of capitalism, setting a record as the largest in the history of the financial world.</p>
<p>He agreed that the power that moved the entire world, even Russia and oil-producing countries, was absolute as they had broken off diplomatic ties with China. Nonetheless, the trend favoring money represented true capitalism. Not even the most powerful entity on earth could quell during a time when the world order was shifting in such a manner.</p>
<p>Attempting to do so would be defying the will of heaven, but, as evident, such a thing wasn’t possible. Everyone was going crazy as they couldn’t pick up the golden fish!</p>
<p>The Minister of Finance banged his desk in excitement.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>Following his outburst, he became bitter. If only he had a few more years, then current operations could have been executed using China’s power rather than bombs, establishing themselves as the center of the world. China’s currency could have stood on its own atop other existing currencies.</p>
<p>An hour after that, the Minister of Finance was in the washroom. He usually had to strain to get all of his urine out, but that was no longer needed. His urine stream was as strong as it was during his prime. He finished the job with a satisfied expression as if this was the first joy he had felt in decades.</p>
<p>He suddenly remembered a young girl he had taken as his mistress, feeling that his vitality would return at night as his power of urination had also come back.</p>
<p>Nice, nice. I should enjoy this while I can. There is no need for me to worry about the future now.</p>
<p>When he came out of the washroom, he walked slowly in the hallway. As he was in charge of the Golden Fish, he wished to relish the feeling of triumph within the building.</p>
<p>However, things became weird as he started to see more people running around in a hurry. He looked around nervously to check if any of the defiant Awakened had trespassed. If so, then he should have heard the sound of fighting between the soldiers and the invaders outside the window, but strangely, the disturbance was only taking place in the building.</p>
<p>No way. It’s impossible for the operation to go wrong in that short time I went to take a pee.</p>
<p>When he approached one of his subordinates from behind, the guy flinched as if he had seen a ghost.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” he asked.</p>
<p>“The counter-sales have begun.”</p>
<p>It meant that the operation was being put on hold. The minister sat where his subordinate had stood up from. The scale of the counter-sales exceeded his comprehension just by looking at it. Everything seemed to be under control up to that point.</p>
<p>However, the issue was that all of the buying power had dissipated all of a sudden. The buying trend, which had been sustained, was being driven by a small number of regular investors. It was safe to say that the buying trend had stopped now.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. It’s no use pressing it now.”</p>
<p>“...Look here.”</p>
<p>His subordinate enlarged several other windows. From then on, the numbers began to blur in the minister’s vision. What typically occurred on a minor stock market was unfolding on the ground where China had gone all-in. It seemed that the golden fish were being manipulated by a group of people with the same purpose as China.</p>
<p>The minister became ghastly pale and began to feel dizzy. His subordinates helped him to stumble to his office. He needed to pull himself together. The Small Golden Fish were aggressive derivatives, but they were futures exchanges, so they were linked to the Chinese gold and renminbi.</p>
<p>This meant if the group that controlled the fish didn’t liquidate their position, the spot had to be delivered to them. All of China’s gold and renminbi!</p>
<p>The product wasn’t made after seeing it this far in the first place. The minister shook his head like crazy because he had only considered the current situation as a hypothesis. No group could fully bear the bubble that had swollen to more than a trillion dollars. Particularly, in this world where the value of the dollar was falling fast!</p>
<p>It was impossible even if the Big Four, the financial empire of the West, collaborated together.</p>
<p>No. No… This is impossible even if heaven and earth opened up together!</p>
<p>The minister stared at the monitor and began to collate the data. He was doing his best to the point where he had lost his sense of time. When he suddenly came back to his senses, two hours had passed.</p>
<p>He staggered out of his seat because he wanted to pee even though he hadn’t had any water since he had come back from the bathroom. The hallway leading to the washroom was still noisy, but he couldn’t hear anything. All he could see were the numbers he had looked at for the past two hours.</p>
<p>Multiple groups had seized control of the Golden Fish, selling and buying among themselves to minimize losses and maximize profits. This happened all the time in controlled capital.</p>
<p>However, the minister couldn’t hide his anxiety.</p>
<p>What if they don’t liquidate? What if they really want us to deliver the goods?</p>
<p>He desperately wanted to void, but he couldn’t pee no matter how hard he tried even though it had gushed out two hours ago.</p>
<p>Right then.</p>
<p>Thud!</p>
<p>The washroom door made a loud noise with a brittle shock. The first thing that the minster saw was the military boot that had kicked the door. Soldiers and police poured into the washroom.</p>
<p>“Minister of Finance! You should come with us!”</p>
<p>Only then did the minister realize that he had forgotten the most important fact. He should have taken his pistol from the drawer instead of coming to the washroom.</p>
<p>“Is there something you want to say?”</p>
<p>A forceful voice was directed towards the bewildered minister, who mumbled while gazing at his poorly functioning penis.</p>
<p>“This… this… this is not… capitalism…”</p>

<p>Chapter 342</p>
<p>“Could you please share with us your insights on the current situation in China regarding the renminbi currency reform? It has only been two days since implementation, and they are already facing challenges. The Chinese authorities have urgently stopped issuing new bills. According to multiple financial experts, the problem might have started with products traded on New York Mercantile Exchange. Why is that so?”</p>
<p>“It’s true that China has worked very hard to break the order of dollar hegemony. A gold standard is a valuable tool in the ongoing economic competition between nations. I share the perspective that this approach can provide an advantage, and it’s a viewpoint that seems reasonable and logical to me.”</p>
<p>“Yes. So what happened at the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday? I would appreciate it if you could explain in easy-to-understand terms for the viewers.”</p>
<p>“Products linked to new bills and gold were traded, but above all, we have to pay attention to the amount traded. Let’s exclude the renminbi first and focus on gold.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“There was a lot more than gold traded on exchanges around the world. Given the scale of this activity, we now need to ask where did such an abundant supply of gold originate from? After all, it now exceeds the amount currently in circulation. What are your thoughts on where this excess gold may have come from?”</p>
<p>“From China?”</p>
<p>“Correct.”</p>
<p>“But isn’t China being sanctioned right now?”</p>
<p>“While imports and exports were subjected to limitations, not all financial transactions were completely restricted. The U.S. would have wanted to freeze the Chinese assets through the second round of economic sanctions, so China would have sought to preemptively change the situation before the sanction was enforced. This is potentially why they took the risk of implementing the currency plan and even engaging in the New York Mercantile Exchange.”</p>
<p>“So why did yesterday’s New York Mercantile Exchange transactions play an important role?”</p>
<p>“Modern wars differ significantly from those in the past as they don’t necessarily involve physical combat. They are commonly referred to as ‘currency wars’ or ‘wars without gunfire.’”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see.”</p>
<p>“If a currency war breaks out, then the entire world would turn into a battlefield.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“Because the exchanges that trade stocks, futures, and foreign exchanges are distributed all around the world. Local wars break out simultaneously, and there are bound to be warzones that determine the victory or defeat of the war among them.”</p>
<p>“So the New York Mercantile Exchange must have served that role yesterday, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Gold prices were being supported by dollar-based financial conglomerates at exchanges back then as they were defending it with all their might. But despite their efforts, gold prices continued to rise. However, this trend reversed suddenly when certain traded products experienced a significant decline. Since then, there have been attacks suspected to be originating from the Chinese capital. But… as you can see, it seems that these efforts had limited impact on changing the market outcomes.”</p>
<p>“Then, is the war still going on?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“So… Am I correct in understanding that the transactions conducted on the New York Mercantile Exchange had a considerably larger impact compared to other exchanges, thereby influencing market prices on the latter?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“But here is the question. The value of the dollar is declining while the prices of gold are surging. Why is it that such a contrasting market situation is predominantly occurring on the New York Mercantile Exchange, where significant transactions are taking place? Furthermore, why is China venturing into gold-based product trading when they are supposed to stop exporting gold? The most puzzling thing is that in order to enter all those transactions at a time when the value of the dollar is declining…”</p>
<p>After the host asked the question, the guest abruptly faced the camera and crossed his arms, signaling for them to stop filming. The recording light on the camera immediately switched from its middle-of-recording state to a red ‘stop’ light. The tension in the room was palpable as the interviewee stared at the host with a rigid expression.</p>
<p>Then, the producer strode into the studio.</p>
<p>“What the heck are you doing? You should follow the script. Don’t add anything else!” the producer shouted.</p>
<p>The host yelled back at the producer as if he had made up his mind, “This is what the viewers are most curious about. How can I proceed with the interview without asking the most important question?”</p>
<p>“Who says the viewers are curious about that?”</p>
<p>“Then are they not?”</p>
<p>The tension between the host and the producer remained unsolved, then suddenly, the host realized why the producer was being particularly sensitive regarding this matter.</p>
<p>There must have been pressure from outside! Is it from Washington D.C. as they have enough control over the news station? Or a business owner? No, no… The person must be in a higher position than them.</p>
<p>The host thought he couldn’t back down. The incident on the New York Mercantile Exchange didn’t only deal with the hegemonic war between China and the United States. There were substantial capital forces that ruled the world from behind the scenes. Those who could beat superpowers like China only with money!</p>
<p>Oh, gosh.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo acted as if all of the air had gone out of him, similar to how I acted when the Man Who Overcomes Adversity died down. At the same time, he didn’t only think about the current front, but also included what would happen later in the calculation.</p>
<p>“Our group and your assets will be revealed to the world, Odin.”</p>
<p>I exerted external pressure, but the public wasn’t stupid. By comparing the Day of Advent to yesterday’s struggle, they would come to the realization that the assets of the Big Four, including Jonathan Investment Finance Group, were vast beyond imagination.</p>
<p>Members also brought up this agenda at this year’s club conference. They argued that the entire human race should be labeled with slave marks as the public would soon find out the immensity of wealth I held. Kim Cheong-Soo obviously felt the same way. When I told him what happened at the meeting, he also expressed remorse that the project Tessera was confined solely to the Awakened.</p>
<p>When his stimulant pills became ineffective, I received a call from the White House that the Chinese ambassador wanted to meet the owner of the club.</p>
<p>It was said that there was a punishment called Domoji during the Joseon Dynasty[1] that stuck wet pieces of paper to a person’s face. As additional layers of paper were added, the slips of paper became more and more adhered to their nose and mouth, obstructing their air passages.</p>
<p>The Chinese ambassador looked like a criminal getting that punishment. He came in with a ghastly pale face, and it seemed like layers of paper were over his face.</p>
<p>As I was the only one present in the office upon his arrival, he could quickly grasp who the owner of the club was. Nevertheless, he appeared taken aback as he saw a young Asian adult waiting for him and became distracted for a few moments. It was only after I gestured towards the couch with my chin that he quietly took a seat across from me.</p>
<p>“...We apologize first that our leader couldn’t come.”</p>
<p>Despite the cold weather, he was sweating. He wiped his forehead with a wet handkerchief, and the way he studied my face was annoying. As I remained silent, an uncomfortable hush descended into the atmosphere. The ambassador opened his mouth as he couldn’t stand the silence.</p>
<p>“It started when the authorities detained the Awakened. The leader is concerned that you and the world leaders are failing to overcome the association’s coercion.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t just me who was experiencing sleep deprivation, as Kim Cheong-Soo, my knights, and their elite corps had also been unable to sleep lately. The ambassador rubbed his bloodshot eyes, suggesting that he may have been in a similar situation, then he waited for my answer.</p>
<p>However, he should have been honored that I had let him see my face. I didn’t have the slightest intention of replying to the nonsense. The ambassador coughed several times, then continued, “We will hand over the Awakened who have been detained by the authorities to the association.”</p>
<p>He decided to turn in a direction as I still didn’t answer him.</p>
<p>“Do you have the products from the… New York Mercantile Exchange?”</p>
<p>“Then what?”</p>
<p>He moved his butt and pulled the chair close as he finally heard the voice he had been waiting for.</p>
<p>“The products are linked to the new renminbi bill, as well as gold.”</p>
<p>“Yes, and you guys stopped issuing them. But you will have to keep printing while turning a blind eye and pretending that nothing has happened so far…heh.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t a financier, but he seemed to have heard enough about what would happen in the future from his aides. Otherwise, there was no reason for him to stop breathing with a deadly pale face.</p>
<p>Soon, he became short of breath, and I said to him, “We won’t stop by just designating China as the axis of evil.”</p>
<p>“As… as you know… The World Awakened Association doesn’t want armed conflict. If they intervene, you will be in trouble.”</p>
<p>It meant China would cancel all the products that were poured out from them.</p>
<p>“It won’t happen if you keep your promises.”</p>
<p>The ambassador became speechless since he didn’t have the right to make a decision. He was here to inform me of the Chinese government’s decision.</p>
<p>I continued, “Are you sure that you won’t hand over the renminbi and gold? There is still a lot of time left before the expiration date. You are being too hasty.”</p>
<p>The ambassador became overwhelmed with fear. Was it because he was facing me? No. it was because he knew that the currency war could turn into World War III, where real nuclear missiles would be used, if he said a single wrong word.</p>
<p>Within a short span, he started trembling visibly. Despite attempting to conceal his apprehension by clenching his fist, even his hand was shaking.</p>
<p>“The leader said… we won’t… transfer… Please listen until the end. I’m sorry to tell you this, but you must not want an all-out war.”</p>
<p>They were thieves. Although they sold items without limitations, now that things hadn’t gone according to their plans, they were acting as if nothing ever happened. They received trillions of dollars in advance, but they were now saying that they couldn’t give people the products. The most heinous thieves of all time were grouped together and extorting money from others.</p>
<p>I laughed in vain at their courage. I was unsure of how the ambassador perceived my laughter, but he feigned a smile and nodded. Of course, he couldn’t stop shaking uncontrollably even at that time. He was staring at my lips.</p>
<p>“Well, if you are not going to do that, then I have no choice but to forcibly take them away.”</p>
<p>That was the reply that the Chinese authorities wouldn’t have wanted to hear the most. They didn’t have a scenario of shooting nuclear missiles at each other. They would rather let their economy collapse because World War III would render everything a barren wasteland and annihilate all vested interests along with their lives.</p>
<p>“...!”</p>
<p>The ambassador froze on the spot as if he had been attacked by a skill with an ice attribute. He didn’t even blink his eyes, and nuclear missiles were flying in his mind.</p>
<p>Then, he squeezed out, “Please… please give me time. I… I will talk to the leader… again.”</p>
<p>I demanded, “Call him.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?” he squeaked.</p>
<p>“Call your great leader. I’ll talk to him myself.”</p>
<p>The ambassador became indecisive because doing something like that exceeded his jurisdiction and was evidence of his not fulfilling his duties appropriately.</p>
<p>However, he soon rummaged inside his jacket and took out his phone. After he hung up the first call where he spoke in enraged Chinese, he received another call. He handed it over to me instead of answering it himself. The vibration of the phone was as strong as how the ambassador’s body was shaking.</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 343</p>
<p>There was nothing else but a painful sense of defeat left on the leader’s face. He realized that there was no strength left in his legs when he got up from the chair, so he sat down again. Then, he crumpled the reports in front of him and threw them on the floor.</p>
<p>Xiang Yu[1]’s decision to commit suicide was justifiable, given that he was unwilling to accept the prospect of defeat. If the outcome of a single defeat had the potential to drastically alter the course of a nation for centuries to come, then his suicide might not have been considered a significant event.</p>
<p>The leader pondered what desperate measures could be taken to alter the precarious state of China’s fate. From the start, the gold standard currency reformation had been counterattacked. Also, even if they exerted pressure on global companies impacted by economic sanctions, such as the manufacturer of A-phone that had factories located along China’s coast, these companies only feigned compliance.</p>
<p>At this pace, China would be attacked by the occupation forces instead of co-destructing with the world.</p>
<p>“I’m Odin. I’ll pick up my stuff sooner or later.”</p>
<p>As the cold voice lingered in the leader’s mind, a man came in quietly. Having been a friend of the leader for fifty years, he began to collect the documents that the leader had thrown. If the aliens hadn’t tried to invade Earth, he would have been appointed deputy prime minister in charge of economic affairs at the State Council by now.</p>
<p>Thanks to him, it was possible for the nation to have China's Dream[2] and proceed with the New Normal[3]. This brought a stable growth trend in their economy.</p>
<p>The leader said bitterly, “I’m ashamed that you have to see me now.”</p>
<p>The other man apologized, “I’m sorry. I should have dissuaded you more.”</p>
<p>The leader shook his head and closed his eyes. “You have done enough.”</p>
<p>The leader’s office was spacious, but it felt as if the dark air was stifling. It felt more stuffy than a confined area. In fact, the guy was loosening his tie, trying to catch a breath.</p>
<p>As the man read through the reports, time seemed to slow down for the leader, who was immersed in his own thoughts. The documents detailed the failure of the Golden Fish project and the measures that were to be taken after the incident. Many options were available, but only one appeared to be a viable solution.</p>
<p>With holdings of 1.2 trillion dollars in U.S. bonds, China was the largest foreign creditor of the United States. It seemed likely that they would shock the Federal Reserve (FED)’s interest rate policy if they began to sell the bonds to the market. The U.S. FED had already declared its intention to gradually reduce interest rates, a move that was evidently aimed at reviving the global stock market.</p>
<p>Their actions had the potential to disrupt the work, but it would only be a minor disruption, nothing more and nothing less. Even if they proceeded with it, the problem was that one of the capital forces that defeated the Golden Fish had the unimaginable financial power to release an astronomical amount of one trillion dollars to Awakened.</p>
<p>So even if we sell U.S. government bonds to the market, they will defend themselves in the same way with money. There is no need for other defense policies as money alone is enough to protect them. The West ended up giving birth to a monster…</p>
<p>The monster went by the name of Monopolistic Capital, and there was no need to search for it from afar. Across the sea, the Korean Peninsula served as a miniature representation of the global dominance of monopoly capitalism.</p>
<p>Ever since the 1990s financial crisis, Korea has been occupied by foreign capital. The giant conglomerate ‘Jeonil,’ which devoured existing conglomerates, emerged and controlled the country’s economy. In fact, Korea was in a miserable state that couldn’t be called a ‘country.’</p>
<p>As the man contemplated the possibility of China falling victim to the same fate, his expression became hardened, causing the leader to lose some of his own energy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The leader was a formidable presence who possessed a cunning mind like a fox and fearless courage like a bear honed over decades. This made him a warrior who had seized the throne amidst the dark and treacherous struggles of his predecessors.</p>
<p>The leader and the man had a long conversation, but the more they talked, the more the man became aware of the emptiness within the leader. He felt as though all the years he had spent assisting the leader had been in vain.</p>
<p>Therefore, the man’s words were mixed with anger and sorrow.</p>
<p>“It’s not done yet, sir. Don’t hand over the gold, and…”</p>
<p>The leader shook his head. “I just finished a call with the owner of the club.”</p>
<p>The man couldn’t help but close his mouth.</p>
<p>The owner of the club!</p>
<p>The leader had mentioned the individual who wielded the most power in the world and had brought monopoly capitalism to fruition. This led him to conclude that only Odin, the Awakened, had the ability to confront the owner of the club. Given that even the ruthless supermen were often intimidated by the name ‘Odin,’ that meant he was the only one capable of taking on the person who had achieved the pinnacle of financial success.</p>
<p>“Oh, you did?” he asked eagerly.</p>
<p>“All our comrades agreed with you that we shouldn’t hand over the gold. That’s why I informed him that we have no intention to do so. Then, he told me that he would come and get his stuff by himself.”</p>
<p>“Does he mean that the war will break out soon?”</p>
<p>The question ‘only because of the gold?’ rose to his throat. If an armed war between China and the world began, then gold was nothing compared to it. Shiny metal would be meaningless in a world contaminated with radioactivity.</p>
<p>The man realized that things had truly gone wrong. He immediately suggested, “Now, find Odin and ask him to mediate…”</p>
<p>The leader asked back with a smirk, “Are you talking about the Awakened Odin?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. It has already been confirmed from the economic sanctions that the club’s owner has the power to move the world. We will engage in armed conflict with the forces that are compelling us to surrender the gold, but it will stop immediately. No one in the world wants World War III, and the World Awakened Association won’t overlook it. So, we should ask a man named Odin to mediate and make a table of negotiations.”</p>
<p>The leader sighed. “I thought this same way until I found out who the owner of the club was. Who do you think he is?”</p>
<p>The leader gazed at the man with a stiff expression, and their eyes met each other. Soon, the man’s eyes shook. When the leader nodded while making eye contact with him, the man realized why the leader had greeted him so helplessly earlier. Odin was the club’s owner.</p>
<p>“H…how could such… a thing…” he stuttered.</p>
<p>The leader grimaced. “Odin will be here soon. Will you welcome him with me? As you know, this isn’t something that the military should take care of. Our attacks don’t work on him.”</p>
<p>The man was clutching his pants with both hands. He was holding back his fist as a dangerous word was about to come out of his mouth. However, the leader was the one who uttered the term.</p>
<p>“All the Awakened said that a nuclear attack wouldn’t even be able to harm one hair on Odin;s head.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>The leader continued, “It’s risky to test things like his lightning power, absolute battlefield, and gates.”</p>
<p>The man had to agree with that.</p>
<p>“There is nothing to stop him if he comes. Even more so if he comes as the owner of the club, not as an Awakened.”</p>
<p>The man nodded. “Yeah, I think we have left some room for negotiation. When did he say he is coming?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say anything about that. It was a short phone conversation.”</p>
<p>What a freak.</p>
<p>The man’s head was already throbbing. Thinking that Odin focused on money power instead of physical force, the packs of hyenas would rush in after smelling the money. He needed to schedule a meeting with Odin as soon as possible, but that didn’t seem possible.</p>
<p>Who would back out now that the victory had been confirmed? Odin was determined to seize all the spoils, and in truth, the leader was more afraid of Odin as the owner of the club than as an Awakened, as he had never experienced the Stage of Advent. He was actually fearful of the fate that Odin might bring upon China.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The value of the dollar had stabilized as before in the past few days. The battlefields around the world had completely turned in our favor. Then, a series of intense new battlefields began to emerge, arising not only from my aggressive purchasing on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but also from the hedge funds that had incurred massive losses during the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>They came together and launched various attacks, just as they did toward Asia in the 90s. Everyone was now bent on ripping China apart. The depletion of Chinese authorities’ foreign exchange reserves was gaining momentum, and Chinese companies were succumbing to bankruptcy at an increasing rate.</p>
<p>On a day not long before China’s Moratorium[4] declaration, I turned my head while checking the data that Kim Cheong-Soo gave. His office was busy with clients as always. Elite employees who wanted to be hired by the group came in with portfolios, and there were many financial firms who also hoped that the group would invest in them.</p>
<p>The title of the portfolio would be this: Global Financial Crisis Caused by China.</p>
<p>There was a rumor circulating from Wall Street, and it wasn’t by any Chinese spies. Considering the vast global financial network, the collapse of China’s economy impacted other countries. In particular, since China was a country that was aiming for the world’s number one economic power, the crisis would spread globally.</p>
<p>Despite the economic sanctions, the lingering sentiment that humanity had overcome formidable adversaries outweighed all the negative news. Nonetheless, if China were to declare a moratorium, then the world would finally comprehend the true extent to which the global economy had deteriorated.</p>
<p>The world would follow the same bad method as it did during the 2008 subprime crisis, so now was the time to revive the world economy. Recovering stocks after driving the economy into a pit would only strain the flow of capital.</p>
<p>The taming phase was over, so I decided that it would be better to boil China as a whole.</p>
<p>When Korea received the IMF bailout, the world’s capital forces went crazy saying that a super-special bargain sale had appeared and that it would never come again. It was China’s turn now.</p>
<p>The leader called one of the club members, the head of the IMF. That old lady was chosen as the commander of a spearhead to send to China. She was to use every means in her power to completely open up the Chinese market and keep him informed of all that is happening in the country to secure her next term.</p>

<p>Chapter 344</p>
<p>The International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) was based on surveillance journalism. More than two hundred journalists from eighty countries participated in the organization, and Bastian was one of them.</p>
<p>「China at Crossroads: Will They Hold IMF’s Hands?」</p>
<p>「IMF Head, “Strong Reforms in China Must Precede Lifting Economic Sanctions.”」</p>
<p>Oh my gosh, they really beat China.</p>
<p>Bastian was an investigative journalist with a basic understanding of the financial field, so he was left stunned by the incident. According to the article, the minor capital forces had taken the victory.</p>
<p>Some considered the Awakened, who possessed superhuman powers and fierce savagery, as the world’s biggest problem. However, this perception was based on their limited knowledge of the group as the issues related to Awakened were all resolved by the World Awakened Association.</p>
<p>Hence, the foremost issue of global concern was the extreme economic disparity prevailing in the world. The apparent currency war between China and other nations, also known as US dollars against Chinese renminbi, was essentially a struggle for power and resources between a few dominant capital forces that monopolized wealth and the Chinese economy. The capital forces were the Big 4, including the Jonathan Group, Gillian Group, Telestar Investment, Gold and Silver Investment, and their followers.</p>
<p>This wasn’t the first time that they had destroyed a country. During the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s, many Asian nations collapsed like dominoes, and even Russia was swirled up in the disaster.</p>
<p>However, comparing the Asian countries of the past and the current China was impossible. China was currently the second-richest nation in the world after beating Japan in various economic indicators. During the financial crisis, many capitalists had attacked Asian countries’ poorly thought-out financial policies and intimidated them, but this was an all-out war on national fortunes.</p>
<p>A small number of capital forces had overpowered China with only money in such a war. That meant that their financial power was beyond imagination. It was inevitable that wealth was concentrated on a few capital forces in the capitalist world, but this was too much!</p>
<p>Bastian believed that the future of humanity was hopeless.</p>
<p>「 1. Jonathan Investment Finance Group</p>
<p>2. Gillian Investment Finance Group</p>
<p>3. Telestar Investment</p>
<p>4. Gold and Silver Investment 」</p>
<p>Bastian jotted down the names of the so-called ‘Big Four’ in the financial sector in his notebook and stared at them with a disturbed look on his face.</p>
<p>A few forces have knocked down a powerful country in an all-out war…</p>
<p>What was even more appalling about them was their ties. The marginal forces that appeared after the Asian financial crisis in the 1990s followed the same path to establish themselves as formidable financial empires today. Industry experts stated that the Big Four were blood comrades as evidenced by their collective approach toward existing capital forces.</p>
<p>It was the same on the Day of Advent. The Big Four had been the only ones aggressively buying stocks while the rest of the world was frantically selling. Their actions played a crucial role in preventing a complete collapse of the international financial system and preserving human civilization in the aftermath of the Day of Advent. However, their actions were reckless and deemed crazy.</p>
<p>Bastian was horrified by the existence of a blood alliance in the contemporary financial world, where the parties involved stood to both gain and lose together. It was more terrifying than the process and consequences of them destroying China! As long as that bond lasted, their empire was bound to be the strongest empire in human history.</p>
<p>During the late thirteenth century in the Venetian Republic, the governor-general held the official position of ruler, but it was a small group of merchant aristocrats who wielded the true power. The Republic’s policies were ultimately shaped by this merchant elite through the Grand Council, which they heavily influenced. What happened in a small city-state in Italy during the Middle Ages had now expanded around the entire globe.</p>
<p>Their influence must be great within the Bilderberg Club. This was…a war that the financial empires deliberately created. The detainment of the Awakened was just an excuse. The World Awakened Association is bound to be one of them.</p>
<p>The Day of Advent was a great turning point in human history as the financial empires were completed. Humans had protected themselves from alien invasion, but the power of financial empires expanded out of control.</p>

<p>Each passing day shocked Bastian more and more. It was still dark and quiet outside the window, but he still couldn’t focus on writing the article. Therefore, the notification sound from the speaker sounded louder than usual.</p>
<p>Ding-!</p>
<p>The chat window opened.</p>
<p>No way.</p>
<p>An unidentified agent was approaching him through encrypted channels.</p>
<p>A few seconds ago, Bastian was on the verge of falling asleep, but now he was wide awake. Then, he sent a nonsensical answer. It was one of the authentication methods to contact an informant.</p>
<p>The first time the agent approached Bastian was two years ago. He had sent the leaked internal data from Mossak Fonseca, one of the largest law firms in the Panama Islands. There were 4.8 million emails, over thirty thousand database files, and over 2.1 million PDF files.</p>
<p>He continually sent data exceeding 2.6 terabytes over days, and they were about tax avoidance information from big names around the world, including politicians, entrepreneurs, financiers, and athletes.</p>
<p>This informant also disclosed corruption valued at four trillion, which had been concealed by China’s leader and his associates, who were currently being targeted by the Big Four. The Panama Papers[1] project was made possible two years ago due to the enormous data provided by Agent A.</p>
<p>Bastian hesitated to answer the informant’s message. While he had managed to create a stir, it had little impact on the world, and further revelations would likely have made no difference. With the catastrophic Day of Advent, it had all been erased from public memory, rendering the agent’s efforts futile.</p>
<p>When the encrypted channel moved on to the next screen, Bastian briefly saw himself in the monitor that had turned dark for a second.</p>
<p>Although news outlets briefly covered the embezzlement cases involving pop stars and soccer players, the high-profile cases regarding the big names failed to garner attention from the public.</p>
<p>Bastian widened his eyes as the reporter’s instinct flashed. What remained a disappointment in the Panama Paper revelation in 2016 was that none of the Big Four’s data was included. There were two law firms in Panama that were tax avoidance factories. One was Mossack Fonseca, and another was Carl and Jane’s Law and Accounting Office.</p>
<p>While Mossack Fonseca was open to clients who wanted their services, the other office wasn’t. Nevertheless, the name of paper companies that Carl and Jane poured out overtook Mossack Fonseca every year.</p>
<p>Bastian was convinced that it was a dedicated factory for the Big Four. He pressed the keyboard with trembling hands.</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>Bastian felt like he was out of breath. Aside from how the informant had obtained such data, it was finally the moment to cross the walls of financial empires. On the other hand, he was concerned about what type of threats the guards of the empire would pose. Two of the leading journalists in the revelation had died in a mysterious car explosion and were buried in silence. It was obvious who had killed them.</p>
<p>The encrypted channel transitioned to a new screen and initiated a fresh chat window. Tracing the source of the complex interplay of interests among thousands of paper companies was a task that could not be accomplished quickly.</p>
<p>The information at hand was more intricate than that in 2016, and it was clear that the task could not be undertaken alone. Even with assistance from comrades at ICJI, it seemed that the investigation would take longer than a year. Most concerning of all, the situation had worsened compared to back then as the Big Four’s capital now dominated the world’s media since the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>Bastian felt like he was trapped in a black hole. The data was a gigantic puzzle. While the financial industry often referred to derivatives from China registered on the New York Mercantile Exchange as enigmatic, Bastian was certain that the magnitude of this situation was incomparable.</p>
<p>At that time, the existing chat window disappeared and a new one popped up.</p>
<p>The company’s name on the data was Destiny, and they were a pharmaceutical corporation.</p>
<p>Bastian recalled the names of several journalists who had participated in the Panama Paper, including the Korean reporter Lee Soo-Won.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>China’s ruler and elites were not stupid. What they had planned was irrepressible co-destruction, not suicide. That was why they carried out currency reforms that would certainly fail in the first place and created an unaffordable bubble on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</p>
<p>If they rejected the IMF’s bailout now and triggered the global financial crisis, China couldn’t help but face the obvious circumstances that would never be recovered.</p>
<p>When I was collecting replies from my financial empire’s knights on that matter, an email with a different vibe cut through.</p>
<p>「Subject: Proper reports on the first half of the year</p>
<p>From: Destiny</p>
<p>Content: We have successfully extracted new elements by breaking tellurium, germanium, and palladium. We named the new element ‘Destinium.’ We have also discovered the energy that Destinium emitted in combination with its constituent elements, and now…」</p>
<p>I finally received a report that I had been waiting for. It was research that could take away all the value of oil and gold. If they had discovered it earlier, I could have poured a mana stone gold standard attack on China instead. Acquiring more mana stones could pose a problem if the resources were depleted around us, but using the ones already in our possession was a viable option.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the process of converting mana stones to energy was occurring at a much earlier time than it did in the past.</p>
<p>When I completed an encouraging message to send to Destiny, I spotted the Beijing Airport out of the plane window. Kim Cheong-Soo also put his tablet PC down under the guidance of the flight attendant and began to pack up his stuff.</p>
<p>Beijing Airport was severely damaged, but there was no scent of gunpowder. It appeared that a restoration project was in progress, like the construction site of the World Awakened Association’s general headquarters. The work seemed to have halted upon my arrival.</p>
<p>Then, I saw Chinese officials lining up. China gave off the impression of a defeated country, as they had no other option but to sign the agreements themselves, which was a humiliating decision. They agreed to open up Chinese markets that had been closed, because of the unreasonable demands of the IMF.</p>
<p>Their requests included the privatization of U.S.-owned businesses, opening up China’s land, and creating a more favorable investment climate for foreign capital.</p>
<p>However, this was only the beginning. The IMF would proceed with its colonization efforts by increasing its intensity to China as it had done to our country. Then, the Chinese government would be criticized by their people for selling out their economy to foreign capital. That was the expected future of China.</p>
<p>I exited the plane and realized the one with the most rigid expression was the Awakened standing next to the leader. She appeared to be one of those who were currently detained in China. It appeared that the Chinese authorities wanted her to form a connection with me, which was why they had refrained from utilizing interpreters.</p>
<p>She had awakened in her early twenties, was quite fluent in English, and had a pretty face. She was the only one Awakened there. Considering that tears welled up in her eyes as soon as she saw me, she likely was struggling a lot with her painful memories of what she had undergone than being terrified of me.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the leader was perplexed by the woman’s unexpected reaction.</p>
<p>Right then, I stepped to the end of the stairs. Only the leader and the Awakened girl approached me. There was no pretentious smile on the leader's, and he was polite and careful when he asked me to shake his hand.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo, who followed me from the back, said sharply to the leader, “From now on, you should talk to me, not him.”</p>
<p>I ignored the leader’s embarrassed eyes and told the girl, “I guess they still consider me as a diplomatic envoy.”</p>
<p>The girl dropped her trembling head.</p>
<p>“There must be an invitation party, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes…” the girl answered, unable to make eye contact with me.</p>
<p>“I’ll go see my stuff first. These bastards disgust me.”</p>
<p>These guys had tried to steal my things and destroy the world. I had no intention of slicing their necks right now, but I did plan on seizing all of their secret funds and taking possession of a significant portion of their property.</p>
<p>Gulp.</p>
<p>1. A massive leak of confidential documents from a Panamanian law firm that revealed widespread tax evasion and financial misconduct by individuals and entities around the world. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 345</p>
<p>The Chinese leader’s closest aides, including his personal connections and immediate subordinates who were either from his hometown or had worked with him closely, were called the Xi Clan. They were the people who had been helping the leader remove his political opponents as he slowly climbed into power.</p>
<p>Liu Wang was one of them. He was the drafter of the New Normal and served as the head coach of the Chinese economy behind the scenes. It was safe to say that his power was comparable to the power that the Guides had held during the Stage of Advent. In addition to his ability to impact the Chinese economy through his signature alone, he wielded enough power to single-handedly cause harm to individuals by simply pointing at them.</p>
<p>However, the man’s authority was solely derived from his social position, and he didn’t possess any supernatural abilities. In fact, the true possessor of such a power was the girl standing beside him. She was capable of physically breaking someone’s skull and extracting their spine without breaking a sweat.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the girl was clearly rattled by being so close to him. Before we got into the waiting car, she asked me in a cautious manner if she could take a seat next to me and Liu Wang in the passenger seat. Then, she added that Liu Wang would serve as a guide to the gold bar storage.</p>
<p>What was interesting about it was that she actually referred to him as a ‘guide.’ Despite her fear of him, she still used that terminology as it was influenced by the combination of her experiences in the Stage of Advent and her present life on Earth. This was a transition period for her.</p>
<p>Anyway, I nodded because I had an issue to deliver to Chinese economic officials. The girl formally introduced herself when she sat next to me. Her voice no longer trembled as if she had mentally prepared herself.</p>
<p>“My name is Yang Ga-Hye. It’s an honor to have you here.”</p>
<p>Then, Liu Wang got on the passenger seat and lowered his head briefly. To non-speakers, Chinese often sounded noisy as it was a language with numerous tones, but Liu Wang lowered his voice and began to speak calmly. He spoke for a long time, but in essence, he conveyed his gratitude for being able to accompany me and expressed his wholehearted commitment to serving me.</p>
<p>As we drove into downtown Beijing, I noticed that we were the only car on the road. Not a single civilian was in sight, and there were only police officers stationed in the area. The road was so empty and cleared up.</p>
<p>By the time the vehicle sped up after getting the officer’s salute, Liu Wang opened his mouth after carefully looking at me for a while.</p>
<p>Yang Ga-Hye interpreted, “He said he is a believer in the new type of major power relationship.”</p>
<p>The new type of major power relationship was the idea to respect each other without having conflict with the U.S. The leader’s purpose for sending a business figure from the Xi Clan was to gain my favor and alleviate the IMF’s demanding requests. The leader was obviously treating me as the owner of the club instead of the Awakened Odin.</p>
<p>Liu Wang began to describe how hard he had tried to prevent the incident. I knew it was all a lie, but I let him keep talking. The information he revealed was exclusive to the innermost circle of the leader, but it wasn’t what I had been expecting to hear.</p>
<p>When he started talking about the IMF, I finally interrupted, “The Small Golden Fish was comprised of two elements: new renminbi bills and gold. Do the Chinese authorities plan to continue issuing new renminbi bills?”</p>
<p>When Yang Ga-Hye translated what I said to Liu Wang, he suddenly became quiet.</p>
<p>The renminbi’s monetary plan had ended in failure. Reissuing the new renminbi currency, which was tied to gold, would only cause a national crisis. As a result, the Chinese government was withdrawing and returning to the existing old renminbi notes.</p>
<p>“I can just take over the gold, but how will you deal with my loss in regards to the new renminbi?” I asked ruthlessly.</p>
<p>Originally, the Small Golden Fish was a product made under the assumption of bankruptcy, just like China’s currency reform. It was aimed to puff up the bubble and then slam it. The problem arose there because I had bought them all.</p>
<p>I continued mercilessly, “I calculated, and the damage alone would be worth two trillion dollars.”</p>
<p>At last, Yang Ga-Hye realized why I came to China. For a moment, she couldn’t interpret my demands, but she soon stammered and started talking.</p>
<p>“Since you breached the contract and failed to fulfill it, we must now commence discussions regarding the reimbursement of six trillion dollars in accordance with international practice, which is three times my incurred losses. However, considering the circumstances of the authorities, I can accept five trillion U.S. dollars instead,” I said casually while looking out the window.</p>
<p>Liu Wang was articulate and cognizant that what he said next would determine a lot. Therefore, the car became as quiet as the street outside.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Liu Wang barely managed to suppress the urge to scream due to the stifling atmosphere in the car. The phrase ‘international practice’ had always been a powerful tool, and it had been employed several times during trade disputes with the U.S. prior to the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>As the defeated nation, China had no choice but to comply with it. However, five trillion dollars was an astronomical amount. That exceeded the two hundred and ten billion dollars they had gotten from the IMF when the government’s foreign exchange reserves became empty.</p>
<p>Basically, five trillion dollars was twenty times more than the amount they currently had! Although this wasn’t an act of physical violence, it was still a form of cruel violence that was certain to inflict severe damage. Even if Odin’s thunderbolt, which was frequently discussed by the Awakened, wouldn’t be able to impact the country more than this.</p>
<p>Liu Wang didn’t scream, but he turned his head to eye Odin. Then, he became speechless. The guy who had casually talked about five trillion dollars as if it wasn’t a big deal was now looking out the window with indifferent eyes.</p>
<p>Therefore, the only one Liu Wang could make eye contact with was Yang Ga-Hye, an Awakened he brought as an interpreter because she had been on the same stage as Odin in Act Two, Stage One. However, she didn’t meet his expectations at all.</p>
<p>The vast difference in their statuses, both in the Stage of Advent and on Earth, was so immense that she found it difficult to even make eye contact with Odin. The gulf between them was akin to that between heaven and earth.</p>
<p>Of course, Liu Wang had somewhat expected this, but he also believed that Yang Ga-Hye’s beauty would lighten up the mood.</p>
<p>Liu Wang shifted his gaze back to the driver’s seat and scrunched up his face, indicating that the weight on his shoulders was taking a toll on his entire body. His opponent was the owner of the club and a man with supernatural powers. The man obviously possessed a wealth of knowledge in economics and was adept at controlling figures, like Jonathan and Gillian, who were legendary in the financial industry.</p>
<p>In fact, that was why Liu Wang couldn’t understand why Odin demanded that they give him five trillion dollars in capital right now. He should have known that this was impossible for them.</p>
<p>Liu Wang asked, “Can we replace it with U.S. bonds?”</p>
<p>Odin replied in a calm tone.</p>
<p>Then, Yang Ga-Hye interpreted, “You will still have to give him 3.5 trillion dollars.”</p>
<p>Liu Wang was on the verge of informing Odin that the payment would be made over a span of more than a decade, but he stopped himself. China’s economy would be on the decline for a while. They would be overwhelmed by the U.S. in the trade dispute, and it was impossible to record a large surplus like they had in the past even if a miracle happened.</p>
<p>In the event that there was even a minor surplus and all of their annual foreign currency earnings were spent, the Chinese economy would become vulnerable to attacks from capital forces.</p>
<p>To Liu Wang, Odin looked like an atrocious monster. He walked like a human and was dressed in an expensive suit, but his jaws were wider than any of the extraterrestrial monsters that had invaded on the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>What was the reason for Odin sending occupation forces, the IMF, to forcefully enter the market? In light of the newly opened up market, who would control them? It was Odin. The nation would be ruined, and all the Chinese companies and state-owned businesses with high potential would be busy getting into Odin’s pockets.</p>
<p>However, Odin would never be happy with that. He was asking for five trillion dollars in capital, including a penalty for the loss.</p>
<p>Right then, Liu Wang heard a familiar word that didn’t have to go through the interpreter. Panama Papers! Mossack Fonseca!</p>
<p>In fact, Liu Wang and his family had secretly amassed a slush fund in the capital. He felt that the invisible hand of darkness had grabbed and was pulling his hair strongly to the ground. It was the story he wanted to hide, but Odin clearly knew the existence of the slush funds.</p>
<p>At that time, Liu Wang gasped.</p>
<p>Yang Ga-Hye said, “He is asking if it would be possible if the Chinese authorities collected all the offshore funds.”</p>
<p>To what extent will he deplete our funds? Will he go as far as to extract our very bone marrow?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the problem at hand was that the offshore slush funds didn’t solely belong to the current government. It could have been feasible to accumulate 3.5 trillion dollars if China had seized the slush funds of past leaders and their associates. This was a matter that all of China’s powerful figures throughout history were intertwined in!</p>
<p>Liu Wang had to answer, so he barely opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“... As you know, touching the slush funds of the old regime in addition to the current government creates a lot of issues. Please consider the situation of the authorities.”</p>
<p>“He asked if you mean you want to rebel now.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>Liu Wang became afraid to speak more. He felt a shiver run down his spine as he anticipated what avaricious words the monster in the back seat would spew next.</p>
<p>“I saved you from drowning, but it’s like you are asking me to even take care of your stuff. If you are afraid of rebellion, then you should spare no money to hire Awakened. After all, there is one right here,” Yang Ga-Hye translated.</p>
<p>Then, she told Liu Wang her personal opinion for the first and last time, “You will have to thank Odin while he is being merciful. At least he is sparing your lives.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The car stopped in front of the People’s Bank of China in Beijing. Since China had revealed its gold holdings, the gold bar storage located under the bank had briefly gained a reputation as the world’s largest gold warehouse. Under normal circumstances, they would have seized not only electronic devices but also any sheets of paper from individuals who entered there.</p>
<p>Places requiring high security had a similar structure. There was only one entrance at the Federal Reserve Bank’s gold bar vault in New York, the Cat Food Warehouse, the World Awakened Association’s headquarters’ altar room, the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues’ base, and my hideout in the past. In addition, there were people stationed there for twenty-four hours with security devices attached to them.</p>
<p>As a precaution against attacks from other Awakened, the Chinese government may have recruited the cooperative ones to safeguard this place. However, they had opted to station regular shooters instead, as they were wary of the consequences of their previous actions of detaining the Awakened.</p>
<p>Chinese soldiers armed with automatic firearms saluted Liu Wang whenever they saw him. Liu Wang had been silent for a while. As he stepped into the Golden Hall of Fame, a place where mere monetary value became meaningless, he was consumed by the notion that the country would need to generate five trillion dollars in the future. Therefore, only the sound of footsteps filled the air.</p>
<p>Liu Wang inserted a key into the final door of the storage room and entered the password. The lights in the ceiling illuminated a long corridor that resembled a gold prison or a brick factory warehouse. Hundreds of spacious rooms were stacked with gold bars, and the spectacle was so enchanting that it could cause people to lose their sense of reality. Gold had become nothing in this warehouse.</p>
<p>There were fifteen thousand tons of gold bars, which was equivalent to 7500 trucks that could carry two tons each. The light from the ceiling reflected off the gold bars, causing them to gleam brilliantly.</p>
<p>However, it was that night that I received an urgent call from Jamie.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 346</p>
<p>A certain thought came to my mind first.</p>
<p>I returned to Korea after entrusting Kim Cheong-Soo with all the work related to the transportation of gold and the IMF.</p>
<p>Upon receiving the report of an abnormal phenomenon, I initially assumed that the ritual had begun. However, the picture taken of the abnormalities was quite unusual. The entrance of the association headquarters was now blocked with a blue barrier, which was similar to how dungeons worked.</p>
<p>When Jamie and I arrived at the location by helicopter, we noticed that the press had gathered outside the area controlled by the military and police. Both Korean and foreign journalists were present, indicating their interest in the association.</p>
<p>Since the association had requested for an embargo[1], there was no breaking news broadcasted on television immediately. However, news of the phenomenon had spread out through social media.</p>
<p>At a glance, it looked like the headquarters had become a dungeon. It was like how the whole area was blocked by the power of the Old One when the Awakened entered the dungeon of the Seven Demon Kings in the Stage of Advent, except this time, the situation was reversed.</p>
<p>Apparently an external attack was in progress, and it was likely being carried out by a species originating from a dimension known as Star Dragorin. That was the most likely scenario. I had assumed this would happen when I made a deal with Doom Kaos, but I still thought it was acceptable.</p>
<p>Considering the mechanism, by which the Old One created dungeons on the mainland of the Seven Demon Kings, I identified shared conditions. It applied to the dungeons of the Baclans as well. Baclan dungeons were strategically placed in military bases, arenas, and the king’s palace, rather than in residential areas. This led me to believe that I could easily clear them. However, I was to be dropped directly onto their mainland, as in the Challenger quest.</p>
<p>Therefore, my task was simply to establish a defensive system in the designated military areas of the human legion, specifically the current association headquarters where the majority of the Korean Awakened would congregate.</p>
<p>Moreover, the species that the Old One chose as soldiers had to confront the Seven Demon Kings’ corps sooner or later. Their firepower was bound to be dispersed, and they couldn’t exert their power properly in the land where Doom Man resided, unlike when they were in the mainland of the other Dooms.</p>
<p>Therefore, rather than exposing our mainland to the entire Seven Demon Kings Corps, humanity’s safety would be more guaranteed when we were working under Doom Kaos. That was why I accepted Doom Kaos’s deal, so this wasn’t something to be bewildered about.</p>
<p>In addition, Orca and Yeon-Hee’s pet were in the association’s headquarters. The creatures were of such strength and power that they were deemed ‘monarchs.’ Uncertain of the level of difficulty that the monsters attempting to impede the ritual would pose, even if they managed to get past Orca and Yeon-Hee’s pet and reach the altar, their efforts would only serve to delay the ritual’s completion, as they would be swiftly annihilated.</p>
<p>Since the priests of the human corps were all gathered there, the association’s headquarters was technically an SSS-class dungeon.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Zeus’s Thunder Spear has been removed.]</p>
<p>I told Jamie, “Expand the restricted area as wide as possible.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The association’s boundaries remained fixed using the same reasoning that created Odin’s Absolute Warzone. Nonetheless, during my conflict with Doom Dejire, a minor blemish had appeared on the Absolute Warzone, suggesting that a forceful impact being exerted over several days could potentially create a small crack.</p>
<p>Zing-!</p>
<p>Stalks of lightning remained for a long time after the thunderstorms passed. Therefore, those who were shocked were the few people who were able to witness the scene inside the boundaries instead of only looking from the outside.</p>
<p>Jamie was one of those lucky people. Although she had seen the Valkyrie during the club conference, it was her first time directly witnessing a destructive force. Since she was a club member, there were many ways for her to access the superhuman abilities of the Awakened.</p>
<p>There were multiple cases where the Awakened causing problems had been captured on video. However, countries made every effort to conceal these incidents by categorizing them as confidential. Things hadn’t gotten out of control as each country spent around two hundred thousand dollars per person to shut their mouths</p>
<p>Anyway, Jamie was definitely more fascinated by the thunderstorms than by any of the videos she had ever watched before. As I drew closer to her, the expression on her face, which was steeped in fantasy, became more distinct. In her eyes, there was a scene of charred earth and jagged bolts of lightning raining down from the sky.</p>
<p>Jamie couldn’t take her eyes off the vast expanse ahead of her.</p>
<p>“It will be dangerous if I get closer, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>There was no need to warn her.</p>
<p>I simply responded, “You will become a pile of ashes as soon as you touch something.”</p>
<p>Jamie looked like she was in her dream.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A campsite was built right in front of the boundary blocking the association’s headquarters. If this were the Stage of Advent, the tents would have been made of monster leather and woodblocks, but Jamie’s campsite here was great. We had a spacious camping vehicle and the ability to regulate the level of illumination using mobile LED lights, whether it was daytime or nighttime. LED lights were used as a threat to prevent reporters from approaching.</p>
<p>A day had passed since I had started handling the construction in China in the camping car. After the embargo was lifted, the media began to report on abnormalities at the association’s headquarters. There was an abundance of articles and news pieces about this that surpassed the coverage of China’s IMF bailout, with reported content that included photos taken of lightning bolts from a distance.</p>
<p>However, all they could do was make ridiculous assumptions. Around sunset, the boundary disappeared, and the Korean Awakened had gathered after watching the news.</p>
<p>As I walked through the gate alongside them, the scent of blood wafted toward me. It had been a while since I had last smelled that scent. On one side, Yeon-Hee’s pet was gnawing on something, and I could see marks indicating that a body had been dragged toward the building where Orca resided.</p>
<p>I could hear the voices of the survivors, as well as the association’s security personnel, coming from the same direction. I dispatched a group of Awakened to that side while I made my way toward Yeon-hee’s pet.</p>
<p>Crunch. Crunch.</p>
<p>A huge mouth was chewing off several corpses at the same time, and the parts of the body that were cut and dropped on the ground looked just like human limbs. I could tell that they were not the security mercenaries because they were not wearing their uniforms.</p>
<p>At that time, Yeon-Hee’s pet cast a menacing gaze in my direction, its eyes brimming with bloody murderous intent. The excitement of the battle had not yet been drained from the Kciphos as there were multiple wounds on it. It appeared as though destroying the bodies of its enemies, those who had caused it harm, was not enough to satiate its agitation.</p>
<p>Kraaaaaak-!</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s pet started to scream. Since it hadn’t consumed the entirety of the body, fragments of limbs protruded from its mouth, revealing that it was definitely not a human body. Even though the Kciphos’ body fluids and blood were mixed within, pointed ears were visible.</p>
<p>Judging by the length of the dead creature’s skull and limbs, it was not significantly different from us humans. However, its skin wasn’t blue like the Moong. The Old One must have chosen a species that resembled humans.</p>
<p>I wanted to see the more intact bodies and find the entrance to the dungeon where they came in, but I couldn’t feel the twisted flow of time and space. I wondered if the entrance to the dungeon had closed with their annihilation. It was a possibility.</p>
<p>This had been the situation during the Stage of Advent when Doom Kaos had focused his malevolence on me, which held significant implications. However, for the time being, there seemed to be no issues with the building where the ritual was taking place because I heard the sound of Yeon-Hee’s regular breathing as I raised my Sense.</p>
<p>The regions that were formerly used as the entrance and garden for the resort were now concentrated with signs of battle and wriggling tentacles belonging to Orca.</p>
<p>During this time, Kim Ji-Hoon, who had been persistently pursuing Ji-Ae noona during the Stage of Advent, emerged with two lifeless bodies slung over his shoulders. He lowered his head silently and put the bodies on the floor.</p>
<p>First, I looked at a body where Orca’s tentacle had penetrated its abdomen. That one didn’t have pointed ears. By anyone’s eyes, he was the same species as humans as he had the same DNA as ours.</p>
<p>It was an elderly man with a lengthy white beard that extended down to his chest, and his eyes were frozen wide in fear as his body had gone into rigor mortis[2]. He still had a short cane clutched tightly in his hand. His robe was originally white, but it was now soaked in blood.</p>
<p>The second one was a body whose lower body was cut off. The tattoos engraved all over the body stood out, but this body could be regarded as a female human.</p>
<p>The two bodies shared a common trait in that the same sentence was inscribed on the elderly man’s robe and tattooed onto the woman’s chest. The sentence ran vertically through all seven archetypes, and it was undoubtedly an indication of their respective groups.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long before I found what it was. The weapons of the intruders, which were brought in by the Awakened under Kim ji-Hoon’s guidance, shared a common name.</p>
<p>[Lacryma Priest Organization’s Big Shield]</p>
<p>[Lacryma Priest Organization's Combat Cane]</p>
<p>[Lacryma Priest Organization’s Sacred Sword]</p>
<p>Lacryma Priest Organization… One of the residents in the Savior’s city expressed his opinion of the group.</p>
<p>“The invaders weren’t monsters. There must have been another Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>That might have been the case for those who didn’t know the truth.</p>
<p>After kicking a severed head in their direction, the Awakened noticed the pointed ears on the head.</p>
<p>I stated calmly, “They are not humans. They are enemies we have to confront in the future.”</p>
<p>Then, I turned to the tentacle castle where Orca stayed. The Lacryma Priest Organization probably had the goal of destroying the altar of Doom Man.</p>
<p>However, they might have misunderstood that the altar was at Orca’s place since the traces of the battle were concentrated there. It was natural because the ominous aura emanating from Orca’s castle had captured their attention.</p>
<p>I walked to where Orca was. Although the size of the invading force was relatively small, consisting of only two attack squads, it appeared that they possessed enough core skills to break through Orca’s realm and hurt it.</p>
<p>Orca greeted me with five bodies spread out as if it was appreciating its masterpiece.</p>
<p>“Lacryma.”</p>
<p>The term mentioned earlier also came out of the darkness in Orca’s hood. I nodded and then replied, “That name might refer to the Old One. What do you think?”</p>
<p>1. An agreement between a source and journalists not to publish or report on a story until a specified date and time. ☜</p>
<p>2. The stiffening of the body’s muscles after death due to the depletion of ATP, which causes the inability of the muscles to relax. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 347</p>
<p>Orca nodded slowly, then stared at the bodies. I sensed that it was lost in its own sense of power and pride as it looked at them. Apparently the five men who had made it this far were formidable enough to elicit such a response from Orca.</p>
<p>Orca was observing their dead bodies as if it was admiring a work of art while emanating an aura that suggested it didn’t want to be disturbed.</p>
<p>When I shifted my gaze to the bodies, Orca opened its mouth, “Orca’s spoils.”</p>
<p>Their weapons had all been destroyed as it was a quite fierce battle. No information window popped up, and there were more bodies of intruders outside. Orca’s insolent attitude was annoying, but it was acceptable. It had defended the headquarters, so it was up to it if it wanted to take all the spoils. I nodded at it to express my approval.</p>
<p>Then, unique Maruka tentacles grew out of the mud. Dozens of small and thick tentacles intertwined with each other to form the shape of a throne. Other tentacles that were not part of the throne were used to tie up the dismembered body parts. The remains of a body that had been severed from the head down to the groin, as well as the body of a female whose limbs had been completely cut off, were pieced together and suspended in the air like exhibits.</p>
<p>I left after watching Orca appreciating its trophies.</p>
<p>The structures that once served as warehouses and stores in the former Jeonil Resort were in ruins. Although they had already been marked for demolition, the destruction of power lines and buried pipes resulted in water pooling on one side. There was evidence of fire on the other. It was the military’s responsibility to deal with them.</p>
<p>Jamie had entered with the soldiers, and she walked towards me. Upon seeing the forty-five torn and trampled bodies that had died in various ways, she eventually began to vomit. Only the Awakened could look around the place where blood and organs were cluttered in an unperturbed manner.</p>
<p>I spotted Kim Ji-Hoon sorting out the unique characteristics of the dead. Indeed, the composition of the invaders varied. Some were species that were no different from humans, but I also noticed a species that resembled dwarves from their solid skeletons.</p>
<p>The invaders could be classified into three species. There was the one that looked the same as mankind, the dwarf species, and the pointy-eared species. Therefore, everyone had the same suspicion that the extraterrestrial beings that were often described in fantasy novels actually existed somewhere in outer space. Yes, like the elves and the dwarves.</p>
<p>Regardless of what they called themselves, their appearance resembled the fantastical creatures that humans had imagined, making the names made by humans seem fitting for them.</p>
<p>“Hehe…”</p>
<p>One of the Awakened laughed in a weird manner, then he immediately shut his mouth in surprise. However, he wasn’t the only one who welcomed the emergence of new enemies. None of them had spoken these thoughts out loud, but they were all thinking the same thing. They wanted to check the intruders’ mainland and regain the power they enjoyed in the Stage of Advent. They wanted to unleash the strength that had been suppressed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After returning home, Kim Ji-Hoon only felt content for the first two weeks. Following the honeymoon period, more frustration overwhelmed him as time passed by. The news was busy broadcasting China’s and the world’s economic war and they often used the faces of the earth’s authorities as references.</p>
<p>However, it was ridiculous. Almost everything was absurd here. Although he was certain that he could decapitate either the Chinese leader or the U.S. president at any given moment, he refrained from doing so, as he had no reason to and it went against the guidelines set forth by the association governed by Odin. He could also steal the fifteen thousand tons of gold stored in China if he wanted to.</p>
<p>What if I grab the Chinese leader’s neck and threaten them?</p>
<p>If the other Awakened didn’t intervene, then he had the power to do everything imaginable. He had even reached the master section.</p>
<p>In fact, he believed that he would be able to exert his power upon his return to the mainland of humans[1]. The ideas he had discussed with his squad members were plans that they intended to implement as soon as he arrived. Their goal was to gather all the Awakened from around the world and establish a world of Awakened under the leadership of the Savior Odin by reassembling their squad.</p>
<p>However, Odin clearly had a different intent. He always claimed symbiosis with the poor mainlanders. He even said that he would implant microchips inside the Awakened. Control was imposed, so the current situation was the same as the time before the Stage of Advent. The Jeonil Group still governed Korea, and the world was only run by money.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>All the time that he had spent rolling around like a dog and fighting like a demon on the stage were in vain. Furthermore, now normal humans looked warily at the Awakened who had saved the world for them.</p>
<p>We are the ones who are keeping the world safe! Not the two hundred thousand dollars or pieces of a gold bar!</p>
<p>The Awakened deserved more, especially those who stood on the side of Ms. Mary in the Final Stage.</p>
<p>About a month had passed after returning to the mainland, and it was an unexpectedly long time. He was unable to exercise his full potential due to his increasing dissatisfaction and frustration, which hindered his ability to make sound judgments.</p>
<p>However! It seemed to be coming to an end.</p>
<p>Ting-</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon flicked his finger, causing a blood-soaked gold coin to spin mercilessly. This was the only item that he was authorized to take from the dead invaders. He snatched at the coin again and began to giggle in a silly manner.</p>
<p>A portrait of an old man donning a crown was embedded in the coin, but the minting hadn’t been done delicately. It resembled a coin from the Middle Ages, indicative of the intruders’ lack of civilization.</p>
<p>Another thing that was important was their appearances. He had seen Odin’s skeletal dragon before, so it was possible for strange monsters to exist in the world like elves and dwarves. If these bodies were still intact instead of being chewed by the Kciphos, then they could be beautiful elves.</p>
<p>According to Odin, their mainland was the extraterrestrial space where the Awakened would invade and advance in the future. He had expected the next destination to be the monsters’ mainland, but the land of the elves sounded much better!</p>
<p>They would depart sooner or later, and there would be no need to make peace there. This was something Odin and the association had consistently declared.</p>
<p>I will be able to exert all my power there!</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon crumpled the coin after staring at it for a while. The king carved on the coin was also crushed. Right around that time, he received instructions for all Awakened to withdraw and return. He hastily stuffed the crumpled coin into his pocket before venturing out to find Ji-Ae noona.</p>
<p>He couldn’t approach Mary or the other leaders of the association, but apart from comradeship, there were always other people he needed to make sure that he was on good terms with. Ji-Ae was one of them.</p>
<p>“Are you going to Seoul, noona? Then, I will drop you off there.”</p>
<p>“By car?” she asked.</p>
<p>“We can’t get around on our usual rides, so I got a car instead. Or would you like to drive? When you press the accelerator, it’s not too bad.”</p>
<p>He had spent his entire share of the two hundred thousand U.S. dollars he had received to get the car.</p>
<p>“There is a lot to tell you on the way.”</p>
<p>“Just send me a message later,” Kim Ji-Ae answered bluntly and turned her back to him.</p>
<p>He lowered his head. “Okay, noona. Take care.”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon then raised his head and moved to his car. Since he had been inside the building where the Maruka clan member resided and had recovered many bodies, his car had quickly become dirty with mud and blood. He could use the shower at the rest area.</p>
<p>Anyway, he couldn’t wait to get off the highway. One of the ways to relieve his stress over the past week was to overtake low-class civilians’ cars on the road. He felt better when he had a quarrel with the owners of bougie cars. He could coquet them, stop the car on the shoulder of the highway, and give them the bitter taste of violence.</p>
<p>After beating them to the point where they were barely alive and were begging for mercy, he often snidely said: “Thank Odin, you poor things.”</p>
<p>He felt a sense of relief after making such a statement.</p>
<p>Woong-!</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Hoon started the engine. However, the phone on the dashboard vibrated and caught his attention. He had received messages while he was cleaning up the headquarters: one spam and another from his father. The others were notifications from the group chat.</p>
<p>The Stage of Advent was fucking long, but it appeared that everything had come to a halt since his departure. The group chats he had prior to entering the stage remained the same in his phone application. Although he had never responded to the chat of low-ranking civilians, something caught his attention all of a sudden.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il.</p>
<p>The name sparked a vague sense of appreciation within him. He was a civilian colleague who had gone to the same school as him in the past. It was when Odin was his classmate and Mary was his homeroom teacher. The savior with divine prestige and power was once in the same space with him. None of his civilian classmates would know the truth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 348</p>
<p>The UN General Assembly usually began its session once a year on the third Tuesday of September. However, a separate meeting could be convened if there was a special agenda to discuss, and there was a UN Emergency General Assembly this year.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han could hear the situations that had occurred in the association’s headquarters through the phone call with Odin. Creatures resembling those commonly found in human mythology and fantasy had infiltrated the headquarters, and their attempt to disrupt the ritual suggested that time was running out.</p>
<p>He started revising his speech after hanging up the phone.</p>
<p>「I am honored to stand before you today to discuss a monumental moment in our history. The defeat of the alien invasion on the Day of Advent was not just a triumph for our nation, but for the entire world. It was a spiritual achievement that should be acknowledged as such by the United Nations.</p>
<p>The repulsion of the alien invasion was no small feat. It was the result of the tireless efforts of our Awakened as well as the strength and determination of all humankind.</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>I urge and appeal to the leaders of the United Nations, including the esteemed members of the Security Council, as well as leaders across the globe. The core principles of the security community, enshrined within the UN Charter, must be manifested throughout the world. To that end, it is imperative that the World Awakening Association serves as the vanguard for realizing this shared goal of global peace, for it is precisely in such a capacity that its vital contribution is most urgently required.」</p>
<p>At that time, a guest came to the room where he was waiting. It was Catalina Ronea. She was a world-famous movie star before becoming an Awakened, but now she was a mere low-level Awakened who was taking full advantage of her celebrity fame.</p>
<p>She took all kinds of interviews and published her memoirs before anyone else. She was also good at hiding a viper-like expression unique to the Awakened behind a fake smile. Despite her low-level, she was spreading a reputation as a competent Awakened among the civilians.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, no one stopped her because she was playing an important role in repairing the Awakened’s tarnished reputation. It seemed she had earned the trust of even the most skeptical individuals in the public. In fact, Lee Tae-Han himself had recommended her as the ideal candidate to become the next speaker.</p>
<p>Catalina straightened her back and put her hands together in front of her stomach. She was always bright and pleasant when talking to the media, but her face was stiff when she faced Lee Tae-Han. She was even conscious of blinking her eyes in front of him.</p>
<p>It was their first time meeting each other in person. He approached her while holding a revised speech in his hand. The manner in which he grasped her chin and turned her face from side to side multiple times was reminiscent of someone assessing the quality of a product.</p>
<p>“Smile,” he said.</p>
<p>Catalina’s stoic face immediately broke into a smile. All Awakened in the lower sections had the habit of smiling or employing sexual tactics when someone pressed their buttons. They had no choice but to learn the skill to survive.</p>
<p>However, her smiling face at that moment wasn’t that beautiful because Lee Tae-Han was forcefully gripping her face. Despite the pain she was experiencing, she continued to smile while quivering. Her face was unnaturally serene, lacking any indication of discomfort or agony. Only her blonde hair swayed as a result of Lee Tae-Han’s touch.</p>
<p>He commanded, “Cry while smiling.”</p>
<p>Following that, Lee Tae-Han checked her various facial expressions. While there were directors who could coach speech writing, coordination, and presentation intonation, in this case, Lee Tae-Han was doing the teaching as there were two issues that would bring a huge impact. One was the agreement between the World Awakened Association and UN member states, and the other was about the extraterrestrial space that the Awakened would enter soon.</p>
<p>Therefore, he had to pay close attention and be responsible for everything.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sinchon, Seoul, South Korea.</p>
<p>“Kim Ji-Hoon, that motherfucker is hopeless. There is nothing much we can do. Just give up. You will never be able to get it from that bastard.”</p>
<p>This was their first time meeting since the world had gone crazy. One fortunate thing was that none of his friends were dragged to the Stage of Advent. Those who were unable to attend didn’t do so for various reasons such as their wives not allowing them to go, attending job interviews in Busan, or owing large sums of money to their friends.</p>
<p>“People say don’t lend money even to parents and siblings. But Ji-Hoon? Gosh, Soo-Il. What made you lend that much to him?”</p>
<p>Soo-Il groaned. “His father’s hospital bill… Ugh. Let’s stop talking about this. I am an idiot.”</p>
<p>“Let’s just say it was bad luck. God might have seen you being nice and didn’t drag you into the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>It was safe to say that most of the people who were sent to the Stage of Advent had died there because fewer than two hundred thousand of the original forty-five million people returned. Also, the association announced that there were fewer than two hundred Awakened in Korea.</p>
<p>He grimaced. “Yes, I’m an idiot.”</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il couldn’t help but sigh whenever he thought of Kim Ji-Hoon. It wasn’t only because of money. Of course, his heart ached when he thought about the money, but it couldn’t be more painful than Kim Ji-Hoon’s life. The more he thought about him, the more he felt sorry for him. Whenever things were about to work well, his father interfered every time.</p>
<p>His life had been like that for more than thirty years. Oh Soo-Il couldn’t forget the last word Kim Ji-Hoon said as he worked multiple part-time jobs to make ends meet. He said it was becoming increasingly challenging to secure new part-time jobs as he was getting older. He then proceeded to ask for money.</p>
<p>Of course, not all parents were loving and caring. In many cases, they were worse than enemies.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il tilted his soju glass as he recalled his memories in middle school.</p>
<p>“It was a mess back then.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t talking about the Day of Advent. There was a period of time that they always talked about when drinking. It was the day when their grade 8 homeroom teacher’s mother came to school and made a fuss. She ran wild while calling her daughter “crazy.” The school ended up kicking the daughter out.</p>
<p>“Woo Yeon-Hee wasn’t crazy. Wasn’t her mother the crazy one?”</p>
<p>“She shouldn’t be called by the word ‘mother.’ Her actions have become even more absurd to me now that I have kids. By the way, don’t you guys miss that time?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“That was the best year of my life.”</p>
<p>“We were too mean, haha. We didn’t even open a textbook during class.”</p>
<p>“Yo, take a shot.”</p>
<p>Their soju glasses clinked.</p>
<p>“But even if that guy went into the Stage of Advent, I feel like he would have survived somehow. I was so nervous in front of him. He was different from us.”</p>
<p>“Na Seon-Hu?”</p>
<p>“You were the one who chickened out the most, bruh.”</p>
<p>“Hey, you were the same as well.”</p>
<p>This was why Oh Soo-Il liked his middle school reunion the most. Everything was a good memory, free from any concerns that he had to be careful in what he said. Everyone spoke freely and laughed without a care in the world. They talked about the same thing every year, but he always had so much fun.</p>
<p>When they were tipsy, they began talking about how they were forcefully dragged to the martial law forces on the Day of Advent. When they took another shot, they were comparing the installed applications on their phones. Those who didn’t install certain applications mentioned a website that dealt with the same content.</p>
<p>The world hadn’t changed much for them, so the topics of their conversations revolved around trivial matters. The Awakened and alien monsters sounded as unreal to them as North Korea’s fat dictator who existed but was deemed as a cartoon character. They didn’t exist in the reality of Oh Soo-Il and others.</p>
<p>“Let’s watch this first. Lee Tae-Han is coming out,” Oh Soo-Il said while putting his smartphone on the table.</p>
<p>「Lee Tae-Han’s, the President of the World Awakened Association: “The defeat of the alien invasion was a brilliant achievement of the United Nations.” 」</p>
<p>“He is fluent in English. He must have learned it in the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>“He was already good at it. Ah, I should have bought Ilseong stocks earlier.”</p>
<p>「 “The role and contribution of the United Nation in the international community will grow.” 」</p>
<p>“Yo, stop talking about stocks. I don’t want to think about it.”</p>
<p>“Did you lose a lot? They are going up again these days.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, I sold everything when China went crazy. I can’t even bring it up to my wife. Lend me two thousand too. I will pay you back with interest, haha.”</p>
<p>“Interest worth twenty years?”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, don’t even think of touching the stock market, dude.”</p>
<p>「 “The microchip will be implanted in the Awakened as scheduled two days later, on the registration day ” 」</p>
<p>“Of course, they should.”</p>
<p>“Would you say the same thing if you were Awakened?”</p>
<p>“I’m not. Heheheheheh. Let’s order more food. Excuse me, ma’am. One more fish soup and soju, please!”</p>
<p>「 “Thank you for the international community’s support and interest in our association.” 」</p>
<p>“Lee Tae-Han looks like he’s gotten younger somehow.”</p>
<p>“He should shut up and show us his skills, ugh.”</p>
<p>“Then, he will destroy that podium.”</p>
<p>“Is he in the challenger section?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that why he is the president? I envy him so much. Fuck. He has money and a superpower. He is also pretty young. I want to live as him at least for one day.”</p>
<p>「 “The World Awakened Association requires a crucial need for global peace as urged by the United Nations.” 」</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han’s speech ended there, and Catalina Ronea came up to the podium.</p>
<p>「 [UN General Assembly] Awakened Catalina Ronea 」</p>
<p>“I can’t stop watching videos of her these days. She said the Stage of Advent was like hell.”</p>
<p>“At least, she survived.”</p>
<p>“Is she going to rely on special effects in her next film? It will be dope if she actually uses her skills.”</p>
<p>“Why is she crying? Did Lee Tae-Han scold her with his fire bat? I heard the Awakened have such intense sexual energy.”</p>
<p>“Ew, don’t even imagine that.”</p>
<p>「 Awakened Catalina Ronea: “What happened at the headquarters of the World Awakened Association was the result of the invasion of a new alien species. Our heartbreaking condolences to the victims and their families.” 」</p>
<p>「 Breaking News: Catalina Ronea Claims There Was an Alien Attack at World Awakened Association's General Headquarters 」</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il and his friends suddenly felt completely sober. The smiles on their faces disappeared as well because they realized that they would have to wear a military uniform again.</p>
<p>People at other tables began to speak noisily. Oh Soo-Il didn’t understand English, but he increased the volume of the phone.</p>
<p>「 “What is certain is that there should be no more damage and humans dying from extraterrestrial raids” 」</p>
<p>「 “The association is rushing to advance into outer space where the attack began.” 」</p>
<p>No one was giggling anymore. Wearing a military uniform itself was a pain on the Day of Advent. In addition, the sociopathic orders of their bosses at work was much better compared to being instructed by their martial law military superiors.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il was scared.</p>
<p>The images of what appeared to be new alien species were being displayed on the monitor. Whenever Catalina Ronea picked up the printed photos one by one, the camera zoomed into the pictures.</p>
<p>「 “New extraterrestrial invaders resemble humans.” 」</p>
<p>「 “Other species that resemble our imaginary creations, such as elves and dwarves, were found.” 」</p>
<p>「 “If the attackers are similar to mankind, unlike alien monsters on the Day of Advent, it is even more painful and sad.” 」</p>
<p>The photo revealed dead bodies and their severed limbs. Most of the gruesome details were hidden by mosaics, but their sharp ears and blunt noses were exposed.</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il said while his lips trembled, “I should go home. You guys are going, right?”</p>
<p>They were definitely sober. Even though it was his first time standing after drinking so much, he wasn’t stumbling at all.</p>
<p>“Hey… We would have been dragged already if they were to do so. The Ministry of National Defense is evil.”</p>
<p>“...We don’t know that yet.”</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il sat down again as his friends looked at him in bewilderment.</p>
<p>「 “That’s why it’s time to boldly take a leap forward for peace.” 」</p>
<p>「 “Full support of United Nations member states and citizens of the world are desperately needed.” 」</p>
<p>The time was passing by. Catalina had finished her speech, but Oh Soo-Il and his friends were just swallowing their saliva with blank looks in their eyes. The screen turned from the scene of the busy United Nations General Assembly to a Korean announcer sitting in a studio.</p>
<p>「 Breaking News: The World Awakened Association President, Lee Tae-Han, Proposed a Membership Agreement Between the World Awakened Association and UN Member States 」</p>
<p>Oh Soo-Il didn’t know what that was, but things were going quite urgently.</p>
<p>It was then.</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I can pay you back now. You can take it or sell it.”</p>
<p>As those words were spoken, a hand firmly grasped Oh Soo-Il’s shoulder, holding a car key. Oh Soo-Il looked up and shouted reflexively.</p>
<p>“You! Kim Ji…”</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t finish his words because he realized something as he looked into the eyes that looked down at him. The guy wasn’t the poor bastard who took money from him last Chuseok. This guy’s eyes were filled with a kind of confidence to an extreme extent that they felt aggressive.</p>
<p>“I told you I would give it back with twenty years worth of interest.”</p>
<p>Twenty years' worth of interest?</p>
<p>When Oh Soo-Il received a message from Kim Ji-Hoon previously, he believed that the other man had made something up to avoid the situation. However, Oh Soo-Il soon realized that Ji-Hoon was indeed an Awakened, having returned from a place that had been described as hell.</p>

<p>「Title: This agreement is ridiculous.</p>
<p>Post Number: 203381</p>
<p>Likes: 31190 / Dislikes: 42453</p>
<p>Writer: Exuviation</p>
<p>It must sound unfamiliar, but our country is actually used to such an agreement. I’m sure everyone has heard of the Status of Forces Agreement at least once.</p>
<p>So basically, the status agreement on the members of the World Awakened Association goes way beyond what’s in the SOFA agreement. It’s not just unfair; it’s like we gave up our sovereignty to them. Why? Because the agreement only gives them rights, but doesn’t require them to have obligations in return.</p>
<p>Also, if you read it closely, it doesn’t even specify what rights they have or which organizations have a responsibility to coordinate the government and the association’s opinions. It’s crazy, but if they ask for the whole city of Seoul, we’d have to give it to them and pay for the military to protect it as well.</p>
<p>What’s terrifying about this agreement is that such an oppressive agreement took place all over the world. The World Awakened Association seems to be talking about peace to the public and volunteers as human’s shields, but they have established their own kingdom throughout the world.</p>
<p>Things that will happen in the future are obvious. As the Awakened start to think they can get away with crime and won’t face serious consequences, they will become more violent. Even if the association doesn’t punish them, we will call them out on it, but we won’t be able to stop them. That’s the power the association holds.</p>
<p>Soon the association will interfere in the internal affairs of countries around the world under the pretext of saving humanity. Because of that, the anti-Awakened sensation will inevitably escalate.</p>
<p>Wait and see.</p>
<p>So this agreement needs to be revised as soon as possible for the sake of the harmony between the Awakened and mankind. This agreement has gone too far. It’s a completely insane agreement.」</p>

<p>└ Alom ^~^: It’s not a normal situation. I think you are saying something we could have done before the Day of Advent. I’m actually more relieved with this agreement. To enable the association to take initiative, we need to create such an environment, and that’s what this agreement does.</p>
<p>└ Yoo Seung-Min: Wow, what a genius you are. Then, you should go to alien space on behalf of the Awakened.</p>
<p>└ Jeong Chang-Seok: I don’t trust the Awakened, but I believe in the association. Look at their decision in implanting microchips in the Awakened. It’s too early to argue about the agreement now. I mean, it’s not time to talk about harmony yet.</p>
<p>└ Writer: The association is doing well, but I wanted to highlight that the rights they were given are pretty absurd. By the way, the reason we have less trouble with Awakened in Korea is that we don’t have as many of them as in other countries. Plus, some of the Korean Awakened, like Lee Tae-Han, the President of the Association, and Caliber Kwon Seong-Il, hold high positions.</p>
<p>However, look at Japan. There was an occasion when their capital city Tokyo was smashed by the Awakened. Not many know about it because the Japanese authorities shut them up. Many people were swept to death. This agreement will further increase the crime rate of the Awakened.</p>

<p>1. The World Awakened Association</p>
<p>It is a well-known fact, but Jeonil Resort was where the first speech of Osiris, Joshua von Karjan, who was the former president, was held.</p>
<p>That’s the current location of the association’s headquarters. In other words, the entire world has confirmed our country as a mecca for Awakened even before the Day of Advent. When we ridiculed Korea as the Hell Peninsula, our country was emerging as the center of the world.</p>
<p>2. Caliber Kwon Seong-Il and Association President Lee Tae-Han</p>
<p>The status order of Awakened is clear as it is structured in a pyramid. That is why there are fewer incidents even though the mentally traumatized Awakened returned from the Stage of Advent. If they violate the association’s instructions, then they would get killed instantly. They are called killing machines, but the known incidents are very minor problems compared to the actual power they possess.</p>
<p>At the top of the pyramid are the leaders of the association who are in the challenger section. By the way, it’s not the number of Awakened in each country that matters. There is an overwhelming barrier between sections and levels, and one Awakened in the challenger section can overpower thousands of Bsilgol[1] with one hand. It’s not just my personal opinion but an actual fact.</p>
<p>There are already two Korean Awakened who are confirmed to be in the challenger section, Caliber Kwon Seong-Il and the Association President Lee Tae-Han. I can bet my entire net worth that there are fewer than ten Awakened in the challenger section worldwide. That is why the Awakened are afraid of Lee Tae-Han’s orders.</p>
<p>3. The Facts Revealed in Several Interviews, including Catalina Ronea’s</p>
<p>Those who have closely watched interviews of Awakened may have noticed that our country is being mentioned a lot. There are many warnings disguised as advice.</p>
<p>These are the videos that I put information together on my channel.</p>
<p>4. Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s Nature</p>
<p>As you are all aware, the Awakened have endured significant physical and psychological trauma over the years, due to their battles against alien creatures. On top of that, the System tricked them by giving them malicious quests, leaving them with no option but to face danger while grappling with the emotional toll of their experiences.</p>
<p>However, Caliber Kwon Seong-Il’s nature was a hot topic recently.</p>
<p>We are fortunate to have such an Awakened in our country, and we can anticipate a bright future for Korea. Lastly, if you visit my channel, you will find more videos to enjoy.</p>

<p>└ Expert: Your videos are being shared freely by content creators from other countries. Given the attention your channel has garnered, it is possible for you to become the world’s leading creator by establishing a professional studio and enlisting the services of translators and editors. I have so many ideas as an experienced editor. Please check my message, Young Master. No, Ki-Cheol. Please, I’m begging you. It’s because you have so much potential.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I know,” Ki-Cheol sighed.</p>
<p>Invincible Caliber TV broke Catalina Ronea’s record of surpassing ten million subscribers in the shortest period of time. Ki-Cheol started filming videos when he followed his father to the association headquarters. He posted videos because he was bored in an empty room and got pissed by people talking shit about Awakened.</p>
<p>In fact, Yong-Joo encouraged him to do so through messenger. As time went on, Ki-Cheol found himself increasingly drawn to the task. He took pleasure in seeing people who had previously spoken ill of his father now leaving heart emojis in response to his content, and he relished the growing number of subscribers and views that were skyrocketing day by day.</p>
<p>Therefore, he still worked on this even after returning to his mother’s house about a week ago with Yong-Joo.</p>
<p>“Should I… contact him secretly?” Ki-Cheol asked Yong-Joo as quietly as possible about the contact information that was sent by Expert.</p>
<p>“I heard other creators all have editors. Only we don’t. Our videos should get better when we have a chance, so it’s a waste if we stay like this without trying anything,” Yong-Joo replied.</p>
<p>The two looked at the living room. As expected, the Awakened with high Sense was already ratting on a man in a black suit. Jamie Yang, the President of Jeonil Group, has assigned a guy in a black suit for Ki-Cheol’s safety. Ki-Cheol and Yong-Joo called him ‘Black Suit’ because he stopped them from doing anything. The two of them were just mice in front of a cat.</p>
<p>Black Suit shook his head. “You guys can’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Dude, please.”</p>
<p>The man was firm. “No, you shouldn’t. Please keep your promise to the chairman.”</p>
<p>“Things are so much different now… I have more than ten million subscribers. Other foreigners are taking away all my stuff.”</p>
<p>Yong-Joo whispered, “Ask when your father is coming. We should film more videos.”</p>
<p>“When is my dad coming back? Is he flying on a dragon or something?” Ki-Cheol asked.</p>
<p>“I don’t know anything,” the Black Suit replied with a poker face.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol pestered him persistently, “But you can call him.”</p>
<p>“I have no authority to do so.”</p>
<p>“Not even to Jamie? Then, I will go back to the headquarters with Yong-Joo. I heard the raid is over.”</p>
<p>“No,” The Black Suit was strict.</p>
<p>“You might not understand this, but this is a jackpot! Jamie would know, so please call her.”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Then, Ki-Cheol suddenly remembered the wish coupon, but it was too wasteful to use it for such a thing.</p>
<p>Elves and Dwarves… The world of witchcraft and swords actually existed somewhere in outer space, so using the coupon on hiring an editor was…</p>
<p>As Ki-Cheol let out a sigh and waited for the Black Suit to leave, Yong-Joo stole a glance at the Black Suit and said, “We have reached twelve million now…”</p>

<p>Chapter 350</p>
<p>Although the agreement between the World Awakened Association and the United Nations was a matter that was decided already within the club, we had to explain it to the public. It should have appeared to have passed through a fierce consensus debate and a plausible justification as the public were not fools.</p>
<p>After successfully completing the work, Lee Tae-Han flew back to Korea last night. He and I were watching the whole world at the moment.</p>
<p>Today was the registration day for the Awakened. It was natural that the world’s attention was focused on the association as the Awakened had been busy hiding their whereabouts. That was why all kinds of media were buzzing in most of the languages on earth including Korean, English, German, French, Japanese, Russian, Chinese, and Spanish.</p>
<p>In Korea, the time was early morning, while in some other places, it was already daytime, and in others, dawn. The registration was scheduled to start at 9 AM Korean time and continued until midnight the following day.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Korean media focused their attention on the association’s branch which was located in Seoul. Even prior to the emergence of the Awakened, the press had already positioned their cameras outside the designated photo line, aimed at the building. The reporters on site exchanged opinions with the studio over two conflicting issues: the agreement that went into effect yesterday and the transplant of microchips.</p>
<p>The first Korean Awakened who appeared was Kim Ji-Hoon. He communicated with the association security guards in the restricted area by rolling down his car window, and the entire interaction was captured by cameras in live videos.</p>
<p>He definitely expected that the public’s attention would be focused on the Awakened. As he left the items in the association’s storage box and turned around, people could see him dressed in a suit with freshly waxed hair. This could have never happened in the past.</p>
<p>Anyway, no one would have noticed him as an Awakened if he hadn’t crossed the controlled area. His gaze calmly swept over the cameras. Although the association had not issued any particular instructions, the Awakened had probably come to a consensus to avoid even speaking unnecessarily. Once Ji-Ae noona arrived, the atmosphere resembled that of a courtroom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the situation was similar in other countries as there was no conflict between the Awakened, which was contrary to some people’s expectations. There was an implicit rule that even if they met an enemy no fights should break out today.</p>
<p>The Awakened had become cognizant that public perception towards them had gradually soured, prompting them to avoid actions that clashed with the association’s desires. Since they were well aware of the association’s authority, they refrained from any such behavior. Additionally, they were conscious of my anger since many of them had attempted to assassinate Yeon-Hee during the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>As a result, the Awakened had become adept at the art of survival, recognizing the need to establish their safety on Earth before venturing into space. They had already become skilled at concealing their true identities and patiently waiting for opportune moments.</p>
<p>Their focus on personal refinement and avoidance of fights with the outside world stemmed from their innate survival instincts. They had to remain like that under the cameras that broadcasted them worldwide. At least right here on the registration day…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The first registration procedure was microchip implantation. People guided the Awakened there even without asking for their names or levels.</p>
<p>“It’s going to sting.”</p>
<p>She expected this, but the feeling of the microchip being planted under her skin was disgusting. Kim Ji-Ae felt like something more fatal than the Graf Clan’s poison was being planted under her triceps. Nevertheless, she couldn’t violate the association’s rule.</p>
<p>The agreement between the association and the UN member states bore his will. He intended to systematically manage the Awakened within the association, placing them directly under his feet.</p>
<p>In other words, those who disobeyed his orders, such as not registering themselves, wouldn’t be able to avoid punishment. The unregistered Awakened wouldn’t be able to progress to the fantasy world. Thus, they would suffer for a lifetime as they had to constantly run away from the association and face the associated consequences.</p>
<p>If a Chaser squad was to be established, Kim Ji-Ae definitely wanted to apply for it. She believed that if she was contemplating entering the extraterrestrial realm, then she had to be a part of the Chaser squad at any cost.</p>
<p>This was because she had a hunch that the association would concentrate its power within the team, which not only penalized the unregistered Awakened but also executed the registered ones who dared to oppose the association.</p>
<p>Besides her blood relation with Seon-Hu, her previous role as the head of the Public Security Department of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office and her current status being in the master section, suggested that she might be able to occupy the leader position of the Chaser squad. That was why she hadn’t returned to her old job.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae followed the person guiding her, and Kim Ji-Hoon was in the process of registering in a separate room. Then, he made eye contact with her and lowered his head slightly.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae faced the association staff who had a computer in front of him. Despite the short amount of time they had, the association had set a system throughout the world. They scouted elites through headhunting[1] and quickly hired assistants through interviews. The buildings and resources that were needed to serve as branches of each country were also prepared early on.</p>
<p>As expected, Odin was thorough. He definitely had planned everything before entering the Stage of Advent. If not, things couldn’t have been this perfect!</p>
<p>“My name is Yoo Won-Jin, and I will help you register today. It’s a pleasure to meet you.”</p>
<p>Odin had also completed training employees already. They were nervous in front of the Awakened, but not to the extent that their fear affected their job performance.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae thought the elite vibe coming off from the employee was boring. He likely had moved from the Jeonil Group’s headquarters, a major company, or a public office. The reason why she was confident about that was that he recognized her. Knowing the face of the former chief public security officer of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office meant that he had been in a high position.</p>
<p>“Have we met before?” she asked.</p>
<p>He smiled. “It’s natural that you don’t remember me. I was in the legal office of Daehyun Group. We met at your office once.”</p>
<p>He would have been at least a team leader or a senior at the Judicial Research and Training Institute that she used to attend. If so, then he would have known much about her. She was particularly worried about the rumors spreading regarding her family's dependence on her uncle for financial assistance while living in Jeonil.</p>
<p>“We, the Awakened, were granted a new life during the Stage of Advent, and even after our return, we still have that life,” Ji-Ae said.</p>
<p>“You must have gone through a lot. I’ll keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>“But you seem to have started a new life too. Are association employees also considered as members?”</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae believed the reason why this middle-aged man had abandoned his original social status and moved to the association was that they guaranteed enormous benefits.</p>
<p>‘Agreement?!</p>
<p>However, the timing wasn’t right. Daehyun Group’s legal team wouldn’t have known something that she didn’t, so he might have decided to go on an adventure. He took a gamble on himself and jumped into the World Awakened Association.</p>
<p>When Kim Ji-Ae looked around, there were few elites like him.</p>
<p>“Yes, the association members are divided into two groups: rank-and-file[2] members and Awakened members. Among our employees, those who can directly deal with the Awakened were able to join the association as rank-and-file members.”</p>
<p>The staff slightly raised his right arm. He glanced at the area where the microchip was embedded, then smiled in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae replied, “The Stage of Advent was like that too. A decision made today could determine tomorrow’s life and death. Your name is Yoo Won-Jin, right? Congratulations. You have succeeded in entering our world even without going through the stage.”</p>
<p>Her words stung, but the staff smiled.</p>
<p>“Haha… Thank you very much. I will wholeheartedly support you. Before we get started, I will tell you some precautions. This is a formal process that every Awakened goes through, so don’t worry about it too much. Please listen to it for your own knowledge.”</p>
<p>First, there would be consequences if the Awakened registered any false information. The actual verification of the registered information would be carried out soon. Second, voluntary withdrawal from the association was impossible. Third, the employees in charge of the registration would be an exclusive window of the association in the future.</p>
<p>Kim Ji-Ae thought after listening to him until that point.</p>
<p>He is not just bold but lucky. He is in charge of me. I must be one of the top Awakened who is getting implanted with a microchip.</p>
<p>It was unlikely that Odin and the other leaders would get microchipped. Even if Odin was considerate and told her to remove the chip, she intended to politely express her refusal. She needed to take the initiative as a future leader of the Chaser squad, so she would not be using her blood relation status with him to get an unfair advantage</p>
<p>“I already know your name, but I hope you understand. May I have your name, please? If you have a code name, please let me know as well. If you don’t, I’d appreciate it if you could make one now.”</p>
<p>“Kim Ji-Ae. Code name: Sekhmet[3].”</p>
<p>“Which section and level are you in?” he asked politely.</p>
<p>She responded, “Master section. Level four hundred fifty-two.”</p>
<p>The staff paused for a second, then quickly began to enter data with a businesslike expression.</p>
<p>“We will proceed in the order of traits, skills, items, and insignias. What traits do you have?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The association’s central server received the registration details and pertinent information of the Awakened. Watching the numbers increase reminded me of my past battling in economic wars alongside Jonathan. At that time, we were constantly monitoring figures on various displays. We were so busy that we couldn’t afford to assume any unforeseen situations back then.</p>
<p>However, what Lee Tae-Han and I were concerned about now wasn’t the Awakened. Those who were on top of our nerves were surveilled by the association’s security team. We had installed a security system equivalent to the service that was used by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank, so I didn’t think there would be an issue with cyber units owned by the military of each country.</p>
<p>However, hackers who moved annoyingly into private organizations were the problem. They were the skinny ones with freckles and chubby guys who lived with donuts in their mouths. I was confident that they worked as security directors in Silicon Valley during the day and as members of a hacker organization at night. They were my biggest concern.</p>
<p>Just like how Orca kept the bodies of the five key members of the invasion team as trophies, the Association’s server was considered a trophy by those within the hacker organization.</p>
<p>I was well acquainted with their habits because I had previous experience hiring them to breach the servers of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. That was also the reason why the association’s security team was desperately protecting the system as they had also worked as hackers before.</p>
<p>Of course, it was extremely dangerous to attack our servers now that the agreement between the association and the UN member states had come into effect because we had jurisdiction. If we captured them, then it wouldn’t be as if we’d merely confine them within their homes and block their access to electronic devices. No, they’d be subjected to more punishment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Lee Tae-Han had zero knowledge of this field. He didn’t understand the reports from the security team, so he was listening to my explanation. He looked at me as if he was wondering how I knew all this.</p>
<p>As time elapsed, the evening arrived. I heard the voice contacting me through telepathy which made my heart flutter. It was a voice that I had wanted to hear for a long time.</p>
<p>- I’m done! Can I go there? I miss you so much, Seon-Hu!</p>

<p>Chapter 351</p>
<p>Soward’s outstanding shooter colleagues had all either contracted with an organization called Cat Food Warehouse, which was considered the government’s secret agency, or devoted themselves to the FBI or the military. However, she chose the CIA because its vision matched her ideals. Compared to other groups, she was guaranteed her own discretion when completing missions for the CIA.</p>
<p>The sick man lying in the bed asked Soward, “How…did you find me?”</p>
<p>A disgusting stench permeated this room, but it wasn’t coming from his breath. Instead, it came from the bandage that was wrapped around his heavily injured face. He had been changing the dressing on his left eyeball whenever pus and blood would flow out, and the odor emanating from the wound was extremely strong.</p>
<p>Soward was aware that he was suffering from a type of plague, but it wasn’t a disease found on Earth. From what she knew, Osiris’s squad members were primarily the Awakened who dealt with the plague, but he was definitely not one of them as they were in Korea now. They always followed Osiris wherever he was.</p>
<p>Therefore, Blood, who had recently expanded his scope beyond LA to the entire state of California, was likely to be an American Awakened. He also appeared to be the person who was also handling the plague.</p>
<p>“Get out of my house right now. I don’t talk to the FBI!” the man yelled at Soward.</p>
<p>She responded, “If I were the FBI, then I wouldn’t have been this nice. The FBI would scorn you by shouting that they would send you to jail, but I’ll pay you. I compensate those who share precious information with me.”</p>
<p>She threw an envelope toward the man’s bedside. As soon as it fell on the bed, several dollar bills spilled out of the thick envelope that was filled with dozens of bills.</p>
<p>“We never ask informants to testify in court. All you need to do is to point at some things and then take the money. I don’t care if you spend that on buying drugs or somewhere stupid.”</p>
<p>“...Point at things?”</p>
<p>Soward glanced at the television, which was revealing a chaotic scene. There were civilians treating the Awakened like celebrities, protestors condemning the violation of human rights in microchip transplants, a minority denouncing the crimes committed by the Awakened, and various media outlets competing to cover as many scenes as possible. The noise of what was going on showed just how overwhelming it was.</p>
<p>Soward said, “Just point if an Awakened named Blood appears. That’s your duty for now.”</p>
<p>“What the heck… are you talking about? B…Blood?” he stuttered.</p>
<p>“You might not have grasped the situation, but you are no different than a dead man. Tsk tsk.”</p>
<p>Soward clicked her tongue loudly as if she wanted him to hear her. Then, she opened a picture on her smartphone and shoved it into the guy’s face. The picture was hideous, and the guy had seen several sickening scenes like that before.</p>
<p>When he had put the dead body in a container filled with hydrochloric acid after committing a murder, the body was crushed, resembling the image. However, it resulted in a mushy mass of meat as it didn’t fully dissolve in the liquid. Then, he buried the meat in the wasteland and covered it with cement such that wild animals wouldn't smell it.</p>
<p>Despite the task being cumbersome, it was the perfect way to dispose of and hide the body from others.</p>
<p>“Why are you showing me this?” he asked.</p>
<p>Soward stated coldly, “This is what you will look like in five days. Every single part of your body will melt. A few hours later after I leave, you wouldn’t even be able to see anything. You wouldn’t even have a tongue left to scream. Well, no one will hear you even if you scream.”</p>
<p>Soward also added that the man’s hiding place was excellent.</p>
<p>“...Fuck off. Do you think I’ll even flinch at your words?”</p>
<p>She smiled grimly. “Blood must have said the same thing yesterday, right? But what was the result? You lost your men, and you have become nothing but a guy with the plague.”</p>
<p>He snapped, “Were you there? Fucking FBI. You guys were watching everything, but pretended that you didn’t see anything?”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, I’m not from the FBI. You are deaf.”</p>
<p>Soward shifted her gaze towards the television, which had grown louder. Whenever a well-known figure from the Awakened community - be it a sports star or a celebrity - was featured as Awakened, the commotion among the people intensified.</p>
<p>All the cameras were focusing on one Awakened, and Soward also knew him. The 49ers quarterback appeared in a suit. She wondered if he spent years leading a group in the Stage of Advent due to the nature of a quarterback leading a team’s attack.</p>
<p>However, it didn’t seem like it as he paid tribute to another Awakened who appeared at the same time. The hierarchy of the Awakened was being revealed right there.</p>
<p>At that time, she heard a trembling voice from the bed.</p>
<p>“Hey, you. Can you fix me?” he asked.</p>
<p>Soward turned her head around with a smile.</p>
<p>“If you cooperate faithfully, I will connect you to a healer. So I advise you to save your money and spend it then.”</p>
<p>At that moment, her attitude did a complete 180. Unlike before when she simply asked him to point out Blood, she now demanded that he explain exactly what was going on. It was hard to get a full picture through wiretapping alone.</p>
<p>There had been multiple incidents caused by the Awakened in the past month, but Blood was the central figure of the major incidents. This wasn’t only because he had quickly gained control over the drug gangs in LA and expanded his influence throughout California. It was also because new drugs were being distributed with LA as the epicenter.</p>
<p>Soward already knew that monster blood contained ingredients that caused negative hallucinations, but Blood’s drugs seemed to have been evolving over time even though they were based on it.</p>
<p>The latest variety of medication in circulation was significantly more potent than the first one. Within a mere month of its release, it had proven to be the most effective in alleviating pain and decreasing adverse hallucinations. Furthermore, it also enhanced the user’s physical capabilities.</p>
<p>Drugs were originally under the jurisdiction of the Drug Investigation Agency (DEA), but this was why Soward was tracking Blood and his drugs. Blood put the drug into circulation not because he wanted to make a profit.</p>
<p>‘He was testing the drugs on the drug addicts.’</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the FBI was a much larger entity than the CIA. Nevertheless, their approach to investigations was inherently limited, given the relatively few intelligence reports they received. On the other hand, the CIA’s focus on preserving individual privacy necessitated the acquisition of vast amounts of information, which served to reinforce their intelligence system.</p>
<p>That was why Soward was devoted to paperwork, which the FBI would consider to be trivial. She had received all the clues and figured out who Blood was. She also added her personal opinion that Blood was absorbing drug gangs into his own for the purposes of testing new drugs instead of trying to make a profit.</p>
<p>Since approaching the Awakened was dangerous, her investigation was conducted only through informants. However, she was confident that her paper would attract Langley’s attention who was on the seventh floor.</p>
<p>However, she hesitated before sending the report because she thought the people on the seventh floor would use this information on a political matter.</p>
<p>‘Wouldn’t it be better to wait a bit more?’</p>
<p>The FBI was politically active and had deep ties to Congress, and the CIA had also taken the same path in recent years. She was perplexed by the reason for this change, but Langley frequently received visits from Washington politicians. The head of a department even made frequent trips to meet with him.</p>
<p>Soward looked at those coming into the building with a serious look. This time, Washington’s big-name politicians, including the head of the department, were pouring in at once.</p>
<p>“What is going on?” Soward asked her co-worker.</p>
<p>The person responded quizzically, “Have you not heard about that yet?”</p>
<p>Soward pretended to type instead of responding, creating the impression that she was too preoccupied with her work on the documents to care about others. Then, her co-worker whispered, “The data was leaked.”</p>
<p>Soward immediately gnashed her teeth.</p>
<p>‘Is it Panama again?’</p>
<p>The leak of information from Mossack Fonseca, the tax avoidance firm based in Panama, once caused panic on the seventh floor before. As Wall Street became chaotic, Washington declared a state emergency. It was the CIA’s responsibility to take care of the mess.</p>
<p>At first glance, the current situation was similar to that moment. The nobles, who had previously maintained their composure by threatening war with China just a few days ago, were now visibly angry and blushing with frustration.</p>
<p>There was nothing in the world that wasn’t done by money, but Soward was particularly outraged when it involved black money on Wall Street. Every time she delved into the root cause of the CIA’s deterioration, Wall Street was there.</p>
<p>The financial empires, with Jonathan Investment Finance Group at their core, wielded tremendous monetary influence. Though it was a harsh reality, given the times, it was especially bitter for her to witness the organization she had risked her life for over a decade undergo changes.</p>
<p>Her co-worker continued after reading the concerns on Soward’s face, “It’s not from Wall Street.”</p>
<p>“Then?” she asked tersely.</p>
<p>“It’s from Korea. The World Awakened Association. They found circumstantial evidence that the identity of an Awakened was leaked. Sooner or later…”</p>
<p>He stopped talking as soon as he spotted the deputy director who was heading to the seventh floor approaching Soward along the way.</p>
<p>She followed him into the conference room after he made a gesture at her. The meeting room was still warm as the heated controversy that took place a few minutes ago still remained there. There were only Soward and the director now in the room, but the director frowned as he wasn’t complacent with the meeting.</p>
<p>“These people believe they are warriors fighting for freedom. You know what is going on, right?”</p>
<p>“I heard the association’s server was hacked.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Seeing that multiple hackers attacked at the same time, it must have been planned. The association and Washington are both mad. The hackers must not have a clue of what they have done.”</p>
<p>The director appeared nervous, as evidenced by his frequent glances at his watch while making the statement.</p>
<p>“The data was sent to the site specializing in disclosure, so they will upload a video about it soon.”</p>
<p>“To what extent was the data leaked?”</p>
<p>“His section, level, and nationality. Up to that point. If it had been leaked beyond that, then the association would have actually done something.”</p>
<p>Soward sighed in relief.</p>
<p>‘Thanks to the association, the Awakened are under control. However, if the association starts using force into the international community, things will get hectic like a reckless locomotive.’</p>
<p>The deputy director said, “We have identified the hackers, so we will step in.”</p>
<p>He finally instructed her to proceed to the location and provide support to his team. He actually meant that the CIA needed to take part in the first joint operation without any conditions.</p>
<p>She commented.“The hackers must be Americans.”</p>
<p>He grimaced. “Unfortunately, yes.”</p>
<p>Soward felt bad that the extradition clause under the UN agreement was happening for the first time in her home country. The United States, the world’s most powerful federation, was the first victim of the agreement that sacrificed national sovereignty.</p>
<p>‘Our government will lose ground when the public finds out about Blood.’</p>
<p>Soward frowned as she felt like she had also changed along with the association over the past decade since she was considering her government’s stance.</p>
<p>“Hurry up, when there is room for us.”</p>
<p>“Okay, sir.”</p>
<p>Right when she got in the car to head to the strike force’s marshaling area she accessed the Internet, recalling the anxious look of the deputy director. As she expected, the materials updated on the disclosure website were being covered as breaking news.</p>
<p>“Authoritarian governments are sustained through conspiracies, and the greater the authority and conspiratorial nature of these governments, the more disruptions to the world occur due to the leaking of information. Whistleblowers from around the globe are using the 'power of truth' to bring about change, helping people to see the fallacy of their beliefs in the political elite, financial elite, and national systems, and to abandon their illusions about democracy. In this way, the world is being transformed."</p>
<p>It had been a while since the founder of the disclosure site exiled himself to the Ecuadorian Embassy in the United Kingdom. However, his words still remained on one side of the website to welcome visitors. Soward touched the latest data on the main screen.</p>
<p>「 The World Awakened Association: The Awakened Around the World</p>
<p>April 20th, 2018. We obtained reliable information on the status of an Awakened registered in the World Awakened Association, and we are here to make it public. 」</p>
<p>Click.</p>
<p>「The World Awakened Association: The Awakened Around the World</p>
<p>From April 18th to 19th of 2018, the World Awakened Association completed the registration of 182,329 Awakened. Lee Tae-Han, the President of the association, stated, “Unregistered Awakened will not have protection under the agreement with the United Nations, and the jurisdiction over them will lie in countries around the world as previously agreed.”</p>
<p>As of the time of disclosure, nothing is known about the unregistered Awakened. In response, the World Awakened Association established an organization to grasp the status of unregistered Awakened. They also emphasized that the task will be done under the cooperation between the association and the UN member states.</p>
<p>The following list is the status of the registered Awakened.</p>
<p>[1] Odin ― Section: Ender / Level: 600 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[2] Mary ― Section: Challenger / Level: 559 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[3] Osiris (Joshua von Karjan) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 533 / Nationality: Germany</p>
<p>[4] King of Hell (Jonathan Hunter) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 530 / Nationality: USA</p>
<p>[5] Caliber (Kwon Seong-Il) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 501 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[6] Hera (Deborah Belluci) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 499 / Nationality: France</p>
<p>[7] Chiron (William Spencer) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 499 / Nationality: UK</p>
<p>[8] Warrior of Sword (Lee Tae-Han) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 485 / Nationality: South Korea</p>
<p>[9] Hades (Balter Schneider) ― Section: Challenger / Level: 482 / Nationality: Germany</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[182328] Tiger (Jamal Khan) ― Section: Bronze / Level: 75 / Nationality: India</p>
<p>[182329] Katana (Murai Aita) ― Section: Bronze/ Level: 62 / Nationality: Japan 」</p>
<p>Soward felt compelled to read through the data, even during such an urgent moment, because of her curiosity about Blood. She couldn’t help but speculate about his ranking among the Awakened, given how rapidly he had risen to power in the world of gangs with his formidable superpower</p>
<p>She was confident that he would be one of the strongest Awakened due to his aggressive moves that made gangsters in the area panic. However, she was bewildered by the results.</p>
<p>“Just… gold?”</p>
<p>The world was shocked by the information about Odin.</p>
<p>[Breaking News: ‘Ender,’ a section higher than Challenger, exists. The one and only Ender, Odin.]</p>
<p>[Breaking News: Odin is Korean. Cassandra’s statement “Korea is the sanctuary of Awakened” turns out to be true.]</p>
<p>However, it was more shocking for Soward that Blood was only in the gold section.</p>
<p>‘Considering that a Gold Awakened has already established dominance over the streets of California, how much more powerful will Ender be?’</p>
<p>Only then did she realize why the Awakened freaked out whenever Odin was mentioned.</p>
<p>‘A man of such power is the same human as us…’</p>
<p>She also couldn’t understand why he was staying so quiet.</p>
<p>For now, there were two things she had to do. Rather than looking up at the unknown area that she couldn’t even reach, she had to solve the issues in front of her. One was to capture the criminals who had succeeded in hacking the association’s server, and the other was to stop the distribution of drugs that were evolving day by day.</p>
<p>When Soward was about to start the car, a creepy sound chilled her spine. Two red eyes in the darkness were staring at the back of her head from the backseat.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry that I’m just in the gold section.”</p>
<p>“Blood…”</p>
<p>Swoosh!</p>
<p>It was unclear to Soward how and from where Blood’s fist had struck her. His punch was quick and vicious, resembling a venomous snake attacking its prey as it slammed into her cheek. Despite the excruciating pain and the sensation of her skin tearing, Soward managed to stifle the scream that threatened to escape and didn’t look back.</p>
<p>“There is no need to shiver. I brought good news, so you should be happy about it.”</p>
<p>There was a red pill placed on Blood’s hand as he stretched his arm toward her.</p>
<p>“This is a finished product. You were the first one who crossed my mind. You have been looking for this, right? Why don’t you try it? Come on.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 352</p>
<p>“Yo yo yo, what’s up guys? Welcome back to my channel, and I got something special lined up for y’all today! We are about to post a video of me linking up with the one and only Caliber Kwon Seong-Il. This dude might look like your average Joe on the streets, but in the Stage of Advent, he is a straight-up powerhouse. And get this, homebody has been strolling around in his undies since he got back from the association, haha! So without further ado, let’s get up close and personal with this super-strong Awakened and see what he is all about!”</p>
<p>The clip started with the cameraman going into the living room from a room. It was a prank on Kwon Seong-Il. The in-suite corridor of the Presidential Royal Suite of the Ilsung Hotel was long. At the end where the main living room was connected, Seong-Il’s back appeared on the screen.</p>
<p>With Seong-Il’s muscular back as the backdrop, Ki-Cheol gave a thumbs-up. The editing was amateurish and awkward, with the image of the Hulk poorly superimposed, clearly showing the work of a middle school student. Nevertheless, Ki-Cheol’s videos always became the most-viewed clips as soon as he posted them.</p>
<p>In the video, there were no empty alcohol bottles rolling around in Seong-Il’s room. He seemed to be regaining his senses, waiting for the day when he would enter the extraterrestrial world.</p>
<p>At an angled extension of his arms, every time he made a fist, the resultant force flowed into his back muscles, then continued to propagate upwards, specifically targeting the trapezius muscles and those in close proximity to his spine. The muscles in his entire body reacted as soon as he applied strength to his fist.</p>
<p>Previously, those muscles were buried under a thick layer of fat as there was no point in being fit in a world filled with peace, but they were large and defined. Ki-Cheol seemed to have lost his words since this was his first time seeing his dad like this.</p>
<p>「 (I was so close to going out of my mind. Isn’t his back so sexy?) 」</p>
<p>“Aren’t they cute?” Yeon-Hee said when she saw the sloppily edited words pop up on the video. The clip continued to play.</p>
<p>“You are filming again? You must be having lots of fun.” Seong-Il smiled at the camera.</p>
<p>“Mr. Caliber. Are you working out right now?” Ki-Cheol asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il rolled his eyes. “Hey, why are you calling me that? Just call me dad.”</p>
<p>“Please explain to the subscribers. You don’t seem to be working out.”</p>
<p>“Huh, subscribers?” Seong-Il blinked.</p>
<p>“Yes, the ones who are watching my videos. They are also your fans.”</p>
<p>“So they are like Krong?”</p>
<p>“Krong?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il explained, “I had something called Kronos’s chest plate. It was the first A-class item I got, and it was frighteningly good. It's too bad that I can’t show you and Yong-Joo now because it got destroyed.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s something like that. I named them Swordies. Do you want to say hi to them?”</p>
<p>“Gosh, you are making me do everything. Hello, S…swordies~ Is this how you say hi?”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol interjected, “You should wave your hands, too.”</p>
<p>“Oh, um…”</p>
<p>「 (Mr. Caliber is shy. He is adorable!) 」</p>
<p>“Hahahaha, oh my gosh. Look at them. They are calling Seong-Il cute.”</p>
<p>In fact, it was Yeon-Hee who showed me this video with her phone. She was exaggerating her laugh more than usual because she hoped her brightness would calm my anger.</p>
<p>Looking back, there was no setback in the preparation process of the association. I spared no financial resources to the system security team. I put together a team that consisted not only of the country’s top award-winning hackers, but also individuals who had previously worked in Silicon Valley and the U.S. Defense Department. In addition, we also welcomed groups of white hackers from India and China to join our team.</p>
<p>However, the end result was bad. Jamie, who had carried out all the work, wouldn’t have expected such results from them as she offered more than basic salaries and membership in the association. We had planned to provide the data that was leaked to the newly formed market, including the list of the Awakened’s code names and levels.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the fact that the identity of Awakened was disclosed by another group was bound to be a blow. It would appear that there were weaknesses in the Awakened association, and me, Odin. That was why I was pissed.</p>
<p>The power that the Awakened had gained didn’t include that of the IT world that human civilization had created independently. It was the domain of some computer geniuses.</p>
<p>At that time, Jamie called me. Yeon-Hee paused the video that she was watching and waited for me to answer the call.</p>
<p>This was Jamie’s first time getting scolded by me since I hired her. Like Yeon-Hee’s tone, which was higher than usual, there was a change in Jamie’s voice as well. I interrupted her coldly.</p>
<p>She hesitated to answer that she would follow my order. For Jamie, who didn’t know much about the world of hackers, it could seem reasonable to scout criminals.</p>
<p>However, that kind of thinking was wrong. The skill set possessed by the hackers on our IT team was no less impressive than that of the association’s physical security team. In fact, had the roles been reversed and the black hackers been in charge of security, there was doubt that our IT team would have been capable of infiltrating and extracting even more data given the remarkable experience of each member.</p>
<p>The key takeaway here was that any firewall currently in existence could be breached as long as the hacker’s organization had LAN line access to a computer that was connected to the world’s internet. The U.S. Department of Defense and CIA servers were often treated as trophies for black hackers.</p>
<p>However, there was an obvious reason why black hackers seldom targeted national intelligence facilities, even assuming that they weren’t foreign intelligence agents. This was because the penalties for getting caught were much more severe. It was a whole different story from robbing private companies and threatening them with the data.</p>
<p>Therefore, the association would reveal a more extreme punishment. The vulnerability of the association’s firewall could be supplemented through Bug Bounty’s Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP). Anyway, those who attacked our servers would be sentenced to life imprisonment. A life sentence without parole!</p>
<p>Black hackers around the world would realize a lot from watching these people getting old and dying in prison.</p>
<p>Jamie had too much work to do.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Is the trading system on hold?” Yeon-Hee asked in a very disappointed tone.</p>
<p>She had been waiting for the day to trade insignias as she planned to reinforce the Clown’s Dagger.</p>
<p>I explained, “Until the successor takes over the association.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “I think this is a better outcome. If we had already launched the trading system, it would have been much more challenging to resolve the situation, don’t you think?”</p>
<p>I replied while shaking my head, “Take the Light Pillar in Act Two, Stage One as an example. Black hackers succeeded in breaking through the boundaries on the first floor, but they were wiped out on the next floor. For a hacker, nothing is more important than not getting caught. Breaking through the firewalls is just the first step. Hacking is meaningless if you are caught, but they failed to hide from us.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee asked, “Can I say that the association’s security team won? I’m just curious.”</p>
<p>I clarified, “No one actually won.”</p>
<p>“But what if we have to come to a conclusion?”</p>
<p>“The system’s security team won, but it was a pyrrhic victory.”</p>
<p>“Because we caught the hackers?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What about you? You accessed the system of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues before.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, it was a system of rank-and-file officers under them.”</p>
<p>It was a time when no system was connected to the Internet. It was imperative to infiltrate the home base to gain access. To connect the USB, armed with the hacking tools, to the server, I had to navigate through a series of security devices that were as complex and forbidding as a labyrinthine dungeon.</p>
<p>“Don’t you know the hackers you worked with at the time? Why don’t you look for them? Is it hard to find them?”</p>
<p>“If those people are in the diamond section, then the association’s security team members are in the challenger section. They are the best in the world.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked at me with a puzzled look as if she was saying, ‘But they couldn’t defend the server.’</p>
<p>“They can hack the U.S. Department of Defense if they want to. So, our job is to make them not think about even doing that.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee tilted her head to the side. “This field is quite interesting.”</p>
<p>“Every field is like that. Whether it’s big or small, there are rules and disputes. You should know that because you used to be a teacher for a while.”</p>
<p>She rolled her eyes. “That’s a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t pretend you know nothing. You were Bronze in the teaching world.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smirked. “You grew up a lot, Seon-Hu. I didn’t expect you to say such mean things, hehe. Do you want to get scolded by me?”</p>
<p>“Save your energy for the night. We won’t sleep at the hotel today.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled and shifted her gaze back to her phone where Ki-Cheol’s video was. When I nodded, she resumed the video and Seong-Il started moving again.</p>
<p>“What did you just do, Mr. Caliber? It was dope!” Ki-Cheol exclaimed.</p>
<p>“Haha, was it?’’</p>
<p>Seong-Il smiled happily at Ki-Cheol in the video.</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“Uh… Ummm… I was controlling my Strength. But… Did you get permission to film this?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Mr. Caliber would have been usually drinking around this time, but he was controlling his Strength today. I think he is about to enter the fantasy world.”</p>
<p>“Wow, my son should be a news reader. You are so good at speaking, son. Yes, I should go beat them all up. They should know their place and never attack us again. Don’t you think so, Ki-Cheol?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. We are going to film an experiment video today. If you show us the power of the Invincible Caliber, it would be a great opportunity to…”</p>
<p>In the video, Seong-Il and Ki-Cheol engaged in a lengthy exchange of words, which was then edited to play at several times the original speed. Even Yong-Joo joined them, then rubbed his hands together multiple times. Similar scenes quickly passed by after Seong-Il scratched his nose several times.</p>
<p>Then, the screen was switched to darkness with no sound.</p>
<p>「 (It was so hard to get permission ^^ Thank you again to Mr. Caliber and the World Awakened Association for allowing us to film. Please subscribe and like the video!) 」</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol’s exhausted face overlapped the message, then the video started again with Ki-Cheol and Seong-Il standing side by side. They were outside with the twelve-story residence building located behind the Ilsung Hotel in the back.</p>
<p>The interesting thing was that a five-ton refrigerated truck for transporting food ingredients from the Ilsung Hotel was lightly placed on Seong-Il’s right hand. Ki-Cheol and Seong-Il were covered in the shadow below it.</p>
<p>We fast-forwarded through the video and paused at the moment when it zoomed in on the marks left on the cement floor. As we continued to advance the footage, we saw Seong-Il leaping toward the roof of a towering twelve-story building.</p>
<p>「 (This time, I will ask Mr. Caliber to carry me and jump up to the highest floor of the building.) 」</p>
<p>As Ki-Cheol held the camera, the video aptly captured the exhilarating sense of speed that was palpable at that moment.</p>
<p>「 (I thought I was going to die ㅠㅠ) 」</p>
<p>“Seong-Il must love his son a lot. He is doing everything that his son asked for.”</p>
<p>Just as Yeon-Hee was staring at me with a pensive expression, I received a notification indicating that the vehicle I had requested was now available.</p>
<p>[Please select the dungeon that will go through transition.]</p>
<p>Of course, I could have made the necessary adjustments on the spot with my Sixth Sense, but I had a specific reason for wanting to drive there myself and select the dungeon personally. My intention was to be the first to infiltrate the civilization of the Star Dragorin and confront any potential adversaries head-on. I wished to evaluate their strength and assess the situation with my own eyes.</p>

<p>Chapter 353</p>
<p>Mr. Caliber Kwon Seong-Il has finally returned from the association’s headquarters. You must have been waiting for a while, Swordies! We worked really hard to prepare for this clip to pay you back for waiting patiently for us. We have many more videos coming up soon, so please continue to support us!</p>
<p>└ [BEST] Time. D: It was so cheesy that they named themselves after Gods at first, but I got goosebumps after watching your video. They’re a different type of human compared to us. Considering that Mr. Caliber only showed us a tiny fraction of his power, it makes a hundred percent sense to call those in the challenger section gods. If he showed something beyond this, then it would have made us afraid of them. Honestly, this alone…</p>
<p>└ Adremarek: This is insane.</p>
<p>└ Shaun: Apart from his ability, I was touched by his love for his son. You must have nothing to fear, Young Master. I’ll continue to support you.</p>
<p>└ Lazybud: Oh my gosh, his back &lt;3 I’d bet ninety percent of his body is made up of muscles. Is that actually the back of a human? Even computer graphics wouldn’t be able to draw such a back. It’s freaking crazy.</p>
<p>└ Kang Seung-Yong: The elves and dwarves are so done now. They will chicken out as soon as they see him. The beast warrior is coming, so get out of the way!</p>
<p>└ Shinkong: [Link: The World Awakened Association: The Awakened Around the World] By the way, Mr. Caliber is ranked fifth in the world.</p>
<p>└ Grape Captain: The first, second, fifth, and eighth are all Koreans. I love it!!</p>
<p>└ New Brand: Odin, who holds the highest authority among the Awakened in the association, holds the 0th rank. The one below him is Lee Tae-Han. What else do we need to say? We gotta take shots for them!</p>
<p>└ Wooden Meat: [Link: Why I’m looking forward to the future of Korea] The Young Master would have known that Odin and Mary were Korean Awakened from this video. How about asking Mary to be your special guest for the following clip? The name sounds like she is a female.</p>
<p>└ Toma: Code name and gender may not match.</p>
<p>└ Time. D: It was cheesy that they named themselves after Gods at first, but I got goosebumps after watching your video. They’re a different type of human compared to us. Considering that Mr. Caliber only showed us a tiny fraction of his power, it makes a hundred percent sense to call those in the challenger section gods. If he showed something beyond this, then it would have made us afraid of them. Honestly, this alone shows… gosh, you are the best, Mr. Caliber![1]</p>
<p>└ Lionessia: For someone ranked fifth, this is nothing. He must be able to burst an entire Graf with one punch. Showing his power to the public was such a good idea. Good job, Young Master.</p>
<p>└ Min-Seob: Nothing? Why do Koreans always belittle others? I want you to keep in mind that that is his minimum power output.</p>
<p>└ Lionessia: No, I didn’t mean that. Don’t pick fights with me.</p>
<p>└ Bioren: Don’t stop me y’all. MARRY ME, MR. CALIBER!! Or you, Young Master!</p>
<p>└ Elf Geek: When can we buy an elf slave? +_+ I’ll only live for that day. (31 years old, male, office worker, Seoul)</p>
<p>└ Clear Sky: In the future, no content will surpass Invincible Caliber TV in terms of quality or excellence.</p>
<p>└ Kim Tidy: Do you not know of Catalina Ronea?</p>
<p>└ Clear Sky: She is just in the gold section.</p>
<p>└ Star of the Flavor: I was thrilled as a Korean. It’s impossible for me to contain my excitement knowing that the Awakened known as the savior is among them, Mary, who is ranked second, Lee Tae-Han, the President of the World Awakened Association, and Kwon Seong-Il, who holds the fifth rank and reminds me of our parents with his love for his kid, are all Korean. This country has been eaten up by Jeonil, but there is hope. [Link: Shocking truth about Jeonil Group.] Please watch this.</p>
<p>└ Star of the Flavor: I feel sorry for that truck more than the elf. It has become a toy!</p>
<p>└ DDK: I can’t shut my mouth. I was expecting it, but this is amazing. I thought I was watching a movie. That’s why I feel worse about the clumsy editing skills. I’m sorry, but that’s true.</p>
<p>└ I’m Sick: …This is pathetic. We are so pathetic! We have reached a point where we are not alarmed by the video’s implications, but rather derive pleasure from it. What do you think is the point of the association showing the power of the Awakened in the challenger section? This is why the media is dangerous.</p>
<p>└ Rockhead: Yeah, [Link: Agreement between the World Awakened Association and the UN member states on membership]. Their attack has already begun quietly. Bullets don’t work. They are even superhumans. Caliber will be able to subdue this country’s military alone. But Odin? He is in the Ender section. Moreover, the association is as clever as it’s quiet. They know how to attack and control us. I’m afraid of that, you jerks. You, morons, should feel the same way, okay?</p>
<p>└ Mr. Happiness: Alright, bring on the next idiot! If we take into account the association’s impact and the Awakened’s authority, their power in Korea is immense. You are being way too negative and not considering the advantage we could gain from them. Tsk tsk.</p>
<p>└ Lunatic: Caliber looks like my dad, but my dad is not an Awakened :’( His body is covered in fat and he has no skills. Only his stomach is protruding lol. He also sleeps a lot.</p>
<p>└ Sunshine: Every father is like an Awakened to their kids. Let’s be nice to our parents while they are here.」</p>
<p>Yes, of course. This guy knows something. So instead of staring at your phone, why don’t you give your parents a shoulder massage.</p>
<p>Seong-Il scrolled through all the comments, feeling uneasy about his face being shown, but he still enjoyed Ki-Cheol’s happiness. Moreover, Ki-Cheol informed him that it was a prevalent trend among today’s youth.</p>
<p>In fact, even those who had grown to become leaders of a group during the Stage of Advent often engaged in taking interviews or showing up on social media as an influencer’s guests.</p>
<p>They were labeled as elites, and they faced tougher challenges than others to earn that status before the Stage of Advent. Whether it was academics, career, politics, or sports, they all shared something in common. They had learned how to battle the world before entering the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Life in every world was tough. Seong-Il was worried that Ki-Cheol might fall victim to scams if they promised money or buildings. He wanted Ki-Cheol to understand the dangers associated with money.</p>
<p>His grades didn’t matter because Seong-Il thought what made school meaningful was the opportunity to learn how to interact with people. Even if Ki-Cheol had devoted himself entirely to his studies, he wouldn’t have learned how to navigate the world unless he was among the top two-ranked students in school and was able to join an elite group as a result.</p>
<p>However, that was just one of many roads Ki-Cheol could choose to take. By staying focused on a single path and having a genuine interest and passion for it, he could enter the circle and acquire a wealth of knowledge.</p>
<p>Competition existed in every world as it was a natural part of life. People strove to outdo their rivals and achieve greater success. When monetary incentives weren’t present, reputation became a driving factor. Even if you fell behind in the competition, the lessons learned could provide motivation for future goals.</p>
<p>Seong-Il dreamed that Ki-Cheol would grow mature through such competition. He was still a child, but he said creators work and succeed regardless of age. It was a good experience for Ki-Cheol.</p>
<p>He muttered, “But the video editing actually sucks. I should get him a tutor.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il wasn’t familiar with creating videos, but the clips that Ki-Cheol and Yong-Joo were making were quite amateur. He smiled with satisfaction at the thought of the two kids working together to film the video, even at this late hour. He felt proud seeing them striving to become experts, using obscure terminology and staring at their monitors with solemn expressions.</p>
<p>Making money, meeting other officials who could be their colleagues or rivals, seeking help from successful experts in the field, fighting over differences in opinions between friends, and getting a sense of accomplishment were the process of becoming a real adult. Not a fake adult like he was in the past.</p>
<p>In that sense, Seong-Il had to lift the restrictions that were tied to Ki-Cheol.</p>
<p>Why shouldn't he reap the benefits of his father’s fame?</p>
<p>That was what the world was like.</p>
<p>Seong-Il: I can’t say much because I know nothing about this computer thing, but cheer up. You are the female president of the Jeonil Group. Odin is merciless to traitors, but he doesn’t throw personnel away because of just one mistake. Oh, by the way, I want to talk about Ki-Cheol…</p>
<p>Seong-Il and Jamie’s phone conversation continued until he arrived at the meeting location.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The destination that was set for Seong-Il’s navigation system was a hill in Incheon.</p>
<p>「 Warning!</p>
<p>This area is the private property of the corporation and entry by outsiders is strictly prohibited. If you wish to enter, please provide us with advance notice of the purpose of your visit, the list of visitors, the intended time of entry, and obtain written approval beforehand.

<p>February 1st, 1998</p>
<p>Jeonil Investment (Co., Ltd.) 」</p>
<p>The notification board was attached to the barbed wire. Exactly twenty years had passed since it was first put up, so traces of time remained on it as it had become rusty.</p>
<p>Those who arrived before Seong-Il were camped there. Five black vans were parked side by side, and when Seong-Il got out of the car, a total of twenty-five people, five people per car, also got out of the cars at once. They were all wearing association security uniforms and were unarmed at the moment.</p>
<p>Seong-Il laughed while looking around at the foreign agents. The first person he spoke to was an Asian who stood out among them.</p>
<p>“Are you Korean?”</p>
<p>The agent saluted. “Yes, sir! My name is Kim Shin-Bae. I’m honored to be here with you today.”</p>
<p>He reminded Seong-Il of the soldier from Act One, Stage One, which was a long time ago.</p>
<p>What was his name?</p>
<p>Seong-Il couldn’t remember, but Kim Shin-Bae’s stiff posture and impression he gave off resembled the soldier in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>“It’s not an honor. Um, do you speak English?”</p>
<p>The agent nodded. “Yes, I have no issue translating.”</p>
<p>“Odin and Mary will arrive soon, so get ready.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. Is there anything else to pass along a request?” Kim Shin-Bae asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il huffed, “You should ask your boss. Do I have to take care of every novice?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sir. I apologize.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il chuckled. “Hehe, I’m just kidding. Don’t be scared. It’s because you just look so fresh.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il had roughly heard that the team had assisted Odin and Mary when they were in the middle of a dungeon. Although they weren’t Awakened, they were competent.</p>
<p>Seong-Il approached the foreign agents first and began to shake hands with them.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Caliber. How do you do?”</p>
<p>“How do you do, sir?”</p>
<p>“Good. Sir!”</p>
<p>“Honored to be here. Sir!”</p>
<p>After shaking hands with everyone, Seong-Il took out the combat backpack he had prepared from the trunk of the car. He packed the same items as he did when he entered dungeons during the Stage of Advent because he wasn’t sure of what to expect in Star Dragorin. Despite the general perception that Star Dragorin was a fantasy land full of hope and dreams, the reality proved to be quite different.</p>
<p>Seong-Il clenched his fist, recalling why mankind was in a safe spot.</p>
<p>Yes, fuck. There is no reason for me to have a headache. Those who stress us out are enemies. I should just trust Odin and go ahead.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shouted at the agents, “Okay, guys. Let’s get ready!”</p>
<p>1. Repeated comment is deliberate ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 354</p>
<p>“The Blue House National Petition Bulletin Board is abuzz with numerous petitions for land restoration projects in Gwacheon, Anyang, and Gunpo. Around thirty petitions have been filed, with many expressing concerns about the Jeonil Group receiving all the work once again. Despite a rebuttal by Park Yong-Tae, a former member of the People's Solidarity for Participatory Democracy and head of the restoration committee, public opinion remains divided due to various suspicions.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was driving. Seeing that she was smiling, she was likely recalling the time we went around the dungeon together a long time ago.</p>
<p>“Moving on to other news, Lee Tae-Han, the president of the World Awakened Association, has established the Safety Bureau to combat crimes committed by association members and unregistered Awakened, as well as crimes targeting the association. Korean Awakened Sekhmet Kim Ji-Ae has been elected as the director of the Safety Bureau. She was formerly a public official at the Public Security Department of the Supreme Prosecutor’s Office and will be overseeing the hacking incident that occurred on the day of registration. As a result, Coril Peterson and thirteen other cybercriminals are expected to be imprisoned in ADX Florence Prison, which was granted to the association by the US government. And without a formal trial…”</p>
<p>As I gazed out the window at the tranquil world before me, I was struck by the realization that the idea of an alien invasion was beginning to feel like a mere myth. The serene world was something that I wished to safeguard and preserve for the future.</p>
<p>Beside us was a van full of people. It looked like they were going on a weekend outing. I watched it pass by and turned down the radio. I contacted my parents whenever I had time, but this was my first time calling them since the registration day.</p>
<p>No matter whom I called, my mother always picked it up. After I talked to her for a few minutes, my father told me to wait for a bit. During that brief period of silence, I had a hunch my father moved to the yard to avoid my mother’s nagging.</p>
<p>Thanks to my father, my mother didn’t badger me into returning to the financial industry. Having seen my natural talent and past successes before the Stage of Advent, she was content to let me pursue my path. She was also mindful of the risks faced by the Awakened and concerned about me.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, my father still worried about me.</p>
<p>He claimed that he had taken up a lot of my time, but it was less than four minutes. At the same time, the car was turning towards the rest area.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We were thinking of getting some dessert after munching on some udon, ramen, bibimbap[2], some freshly made toast and fish cakes. Then, Yeon-Hee’s phone rang. When she shook her phone as if the message was interesting, I also got the message.</p>
<p>The message appeared to be targeted toward the entire population of Korean Awakened, with the exception of Odin, Mary, and the association leaders. It was transmitted through the association secretariat, indicating that the sender was likely someone within the secretariat.</p>
<p>「 Dear Na Seon-Hu,</p>
<p>We are deeply grateful for your dedication and sacrifice in the face of the extraterrestrial challenges we are all facing. These challenges have provided us with valuable lessons and inspiration, and, as a result, our headquarters has strengthened its external capabilities by refocusing our perspective on the outside world and establishing a system based on fundamental principles.</p>
<p>We pledge to continue fostering trust through the use of competitive teams with specialized skills and career paths. Furthermore, we are committed to our mission of connecting Awakened, such as yourself, with meaningful employment opportunities.</p>
<p>First. We will provide high-quality service.</p>
<p>* We promise your family will receive the same service. (We will help you with the details through consultation. We are confident that this service is superior to any offered by other companies.)</p>
<p>Second. We will maintain a consistent connection with the association’s secretariat to ensure swift access to relevant information.</p>
<p>* While lobbyist activities are prohibited in Korea, they can still be accessed through channels outside of the country, such as the United States. Furthermore, there are specific approaches planned for domestic situations in Korea, and the association has not expressly forbidden lobbyist activities.</p>
<p>Third. We will create the best in market (item, insignia) transactions that could be difficult.</p>
<p>* The association is preparing a system to trade items and insignias.</p>
<p>Fourth. We will provide you with employment that is worthy of your competence.</p>
<p>* If you’d like to advance into outer space: we will connect you with other companies to create the best attack squad.</p>
<p>* If you’d like to work in domestic and international jobs: there are many markets around the world that need the help of Awakened. This allows us to bring your value to the highest level.</p>
<p>Jeong Seok-Woo, Senior Vice Chairman/Daehyun Co., Ltd.</p>
<p>Phone number: 010-9652-3687</p>
<p>[email protected]」</p>
<p>The executive of Daehyun Group was directly involved in the scouting, but they were too late. Not only had the conglomerate groups like Jeonil and Ilsung already begun, but the foreign firms had also been contacting Awakened since the registration day. To them, Yeon-Hee and I were ‘Woo Yeon-Hee’ and ‘Na Seon-Hu’ instead of Odin and Mary.</p>
<p>We had registered our fake identities to the association, so the total number of registered Awakened in the world was recorded as 182,329, excluding two.</p>
<p>“Daehyun must not be doing this to make money, right? There’s not that many Awakened in Korea.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee made a good point.</p>
<p>“Maybe they really want to make money. All they have is the reputation of a conglomerate.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I want a mocha latte.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee changed the topic as if it wasn’t worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>“Iced Americano.”</p>
<p>“You might crave sweets in the future. Why don’t you have some when you can?” she asked.</p>
<p>“They must have one there since they seem pretty civilized.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An association agent blocked the vehicle on the way to the hill in Incheon. Upon receiving information from a senior agent who recognized both my and Yeon-Hee’s faces, the new Asian agent visibly calmed his nerves, straightened his posture, and respectfully lowered his head.</p>
<p>They were in casual clothes, but the agents who would climb the hill with us were checking their personal armaments in combat uniforms and automatic rifles.</p>
<p>A palpable tension permeated the area due to the possibility of entering the dungeon with Awakened. If access to the Star Dragorin was unobstructed, then there was no reason not to have combat personnel accompany the team.</p>
<p>There were many things to test. First was if human firearms worked in this new world, and if so, to what extent could they hurt the creatures there. As a result, in addition to the automatic firearms they were armed with, the boxes containing the anti-tank rockets were also ready for transport. Combat agents wearing tactical equipment were also ready to enter dangerous areas in the Middle East right away.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Seong-Il walked out of the group of nervous agents. He no longer looked old like he did in Ki-Cheol’s video. There was a lot of tension on his face too. The only relaxed one was Yeon-Hee as she waved her hand at him.</p>
<p>Seong-Il briefly lowered his head at me and said, “I feel much more relieved that you are coming with us, noona.”</p>
<p>“Me? I’m not going. Who said I’m coming with you?” Yeon-Hee replied.</p>
<p>He was visibly surprised. “Since you came here, I thought, of course, you would…”</p>
<p>“By the way, didn’t Ki-Cheol say he wanted to tag along? I could feel your love for him from the screen. It was a good video.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his nose. “Ah… You watched it, too. But I don’t have a big mouth. Even if he is my son, I don’t tell him everything as I keep my private life and public life separate. Also, outer space is… ugh. When he talked about elves and dwarves, I wanted to scold him so much…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il slurred the end of his sentence while shifting his gaze over our shoulders.</p>
<p>“Osiris? No, he is not coming, and there is a chance that you might not enter.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” Seong-Il widened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Odin will enter first and grasp the situation. You will be on guard just in case things happen. Why? Why do you look so disappointed? Do you want me to stand guard with you?”</p>
<p>He rubbed the back of his head. “No, it’s not that. I heard dwarves are good at making jewelry.”</p>
<p>“I hope their world is just as what the civilians are all making a fuss about. Hm, if you happen to get their jewelry, what are you going to do? Do you have someone you want to give it to, Seong-Il?”</p>
<p>He shook his head vigorously. “Cough. No, it’s just because I have someone to thank.”</p>
<p>“Jamie? She is pretty for her age. Okay, let’s work.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee teased, “How long are you going to joke around with me? You’re more relaxed now, right?”</p>
<p>He pouted. “Hey, I’m not a novice or a coward. This is embarrassing. These people seem to understand a bit of Korean.”</p>
<p>“It would have been better to just manipulate your mind, right?” Yeon-Hee said slyly.</p>
<p>“Haha, no. You are so good at saying scary things with a smile.”</p>
<p>The senior agent was waiting to speak to Yeon-Hee. However, after the conversation with Seong-Il, the leader-like agent feigned familiarity with her. This immediately soured Yeon-Hee’s mood, causing her smile to disappear and her demeanor to turn cold and distant.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee ignored the agent and told the others to carry out their duties appropriately. Then, she waved at me and gave me a worried look.</p>
<p>- I’ll be waiting for you, Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>Right after that I climbed the hill in search of the entrance to the dungeon. Upon reaching the entrance, the agents remained unfazed as the ground vibrated when the dungeon was unsealed. They had become accustomed to such occurrences.</p>
<p>Bzzzz-</p>
<p>They waited calmly for the moment when the stairs or burrows under the blue curtain became visible. However, they started exchanging puzzled gazes with each other when nothing occurred even after the vibration.</p>
<p>This was predictable as all roads leading to the Seven Demon Kings Corps had been sealed off upon the completion of the ritual. However, a new path could be forged, and only I, as Doom Man, possessed the power to do so.</p>
<p>The mere thought of it triggered electrical impulses in my mind as I recalled the moment when the dark power within my Life Vessel was revealed at my fingertips. Dark haze emanated from each of my fingertips, coalescing into black wisps that traveled up my arms from my wrists to my shoulders.</p>
<p>Srrrr-</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s and the agents’ attention were completely focused on me. While everyone’s eyes were shaking, the way to enter the Star Dragorin unfolded in front of us.</p>
<p>[You have transformed one of the old dungeons.]</p>

<p>Chapter 355</p>
<p>Franklin Dukedom, Greenwood Continent.</p>
<p>Oh, Lord!</p>
<p>Elland trembled as if he had a spasm when he finished appraising the relics. Therefore, his subordinates, who mistook this as a curse, immediately prepared themselves for a battle.</p>
<p>The curse of the evil spirit Doom Kaos sometimes appeared in ancient ruins, and they were dreadful. Also, the prospect of hiring a skilled sorcerer capable of confronting the curse seemed like nothing more than a mere dream. If Elland took a longer time to come to his senses, his squad members would have attacked him, thinking he was possessed by Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>“It’s all good! Let’s go back!”</p>
<p>Elland’s voice brimmed with such immense joy that it caused a flutter in everyone’s heart. While he desired to uplift and motivate each of his subordinates, the task at hand was far from complete.</p>
<p>What was the point of finding a treasure? As many historical expedition teams had done, if they failed to exit the area, then he and his men would become skeletons and be buried under the ground. Of course, the treasure wouldn’t be able to see the light of the sun either.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Elland’s men were experienced as they knew what to do next. Though they were steeped in happiness, it didn’t take long for them to be jolted back to reality. By retracing the deliberate marks they had left, they managed to make a successful escape from the ruins. A lookout group had been in the surrounding area and soon Elland’s group doubled in size.</p>
<p>They arrived at the campsite that night, and it was situated precariously close to the domain of the Red-Faced Orc. That was why Elland designated this path as a returning route. The risk was high, but the Red-Faced Orc and the Franklin Dukedom had signed an agreement. If monsters like the Declans appeared, then they could ask the Orc for help. In other words, they could be a great shield if they didn’t figure out that Elland’s squad had found a treasure.</p>
<p>Needless to say, it was the most unfavorable outcome. Spending the night without any incidents and returning home safely would be the best possible scenario.</p>
<p>When everyone was busy preparing for the night, Elland’s assistant approached Elland. He was quite curious about what the treasure was.</p>
<p>“They seem to be ancient documents?”</p>
<p>The assistant didn’t hide the fact that he had seen something.</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Upon Elland’s answer, disappointment flashed on the assistant’s face and vanished.</p>
<p>His name was Malus. He was an ordinary traveler who primarily scoured for weapons infused with the divinity of Lacryma. Due to his expertise, Elland recruited him as his assistant with a single caveat - Malus would have to work as part of the expedition team and surrender any of Lacryma’s sacred armor that he discovered.</p>
<p>However, that scenario would be quite rare, so the contract was mutually beneficial for both of them. It was a common agreement among the experienced expenditure parties like Elland’s.</p>
<p>“What kind of documents were they?”</p>
<p>Elland hoped Malus would extend the contract for the next expedition, so he replied honestly, “For now… It is believed to be the Archives of Saint Cassian. It might be true.”</p>
<p>They both became speechless for a moment. Not just two of them, but everyone knew how precious Saint Cassian’s records were. The Red-Faced Orcs were not exempt from this notion, which could possibly explain their migration across the sea and into the Dukedom’s borders. No matter how much Elland pondered over it, that seemed to be the sole rationale behind their arrival, purporting to act as the Dukedom’s shields.</p>
<p>“I envy you for that. You are going to grab fame and money at the same time,” Malus said.</p>
<p>“When have I never? Please stay with me. The next destination is scheduled upon our return.”</p>
<p>“The God Lacryma doesn’t stretch out a hand to the same person more than once. I will only be with you for this expedition. You better stop exploring for the time being, Elland. Well, if you succeed in returning home.”</p>
<p>The weight on Malus’s back seemed burdensome as he turned away. He had fought against the Declan several times by risking his life. By doing that, he finally retrieved the ancient relics, but he still couldn’t find the object he had been looking for.</p>
<p>Elland understood how Malus was feeling.</p>
<p>Should I share some of the money that I obtain from selling the treasure? Or would it be better to present him with the Blessing of the Altar?</p>
<p>He shook his head, as this wasn’t his first experience working with someone like Malus who was not bound to stay. However, Elland considered himself lucky that, unlike some of his previous assistants, Malus hadn’t violated their agreement by attempting to pilfer the treasure.</p>
<p>Well, at least he hadn’t yet. Elland sent a signal to his squad to keep an eye on Malus.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The night was still, and only the guards remained awake. Bonfires were scarce in the area where Declans could appear. Despite the relentless chill, the sentries struggled to keep their eyes open.</p>
<p>Suddenly, one of the sentries’ eyes widened in alarm. Right then Malus bolted out of the tent as he had sensed an ominous presence. His eyes glinted with a crimson aura as he gazed ahead. Then, the looming figures concealed in the shadows revealed themselves.</p>
<p>They were not Declan warriors, as they were larger in size and lacked dog-like snouts. Instead, their protruding molars were hideously shining under the moonlight. The orcs that emerged with traces of Declan blood on their faces appeared formidable.</p>
<p>Malus noticed a red aura in their eyes that was akin to his own.</p>
<p>Shit.</p>
<p>Malus signaled to the sentries to wake Elland up, then he walked toward the orc chief. It wasn’t his first time seeing them, but he couldn’t help but be overwhelmed by their intimidating presence.</p>
<p>There were fifteen orcs, including their leader. Considering that the leader of the orcs was protected by their Lord, they had to brace themselves for extermination if they harbored any murderous intent.</p>
<p>“What are the Lord’s warriors doing here?”</p>
<p>The head of the orcs loosened its grip on the ax.</p>
<p>“You have met us before,” the orc answered.</p>
<p>“Yes, I have met the warriors of the Steel Molar Clan.”</p>
<p>“You met trash.”</p>
<p>The orc’s voice contained hostility.</p>
<p>Oh, are they rivals? Damn it. When will Elland show up?</p>
<p>As Malus stood in stunned silence and checked his back, Elland was, fortunately, hurrying towards him. “I’m sorry. I’m the leader of these people. You may speak to me, warriors.”</p>
<p>Malus honestly admired Ellard’s polite attitude.</p>
<p>He stepped back while skimming through each orc. It seemed like they had recently engaged in a fierce battle with the Declans, as the bloodstains on their faces hadn’t yet congealed. Furthermore, scraps of freshly skinned Declan leather protruded from the bags they carried. Each orc had pouches, presumably containing mana stones, with blood oozing out from there.</p>
<p>Aren’t they after us? I hope I escape from this situation somehow.</p>
<p>After calculating the possible scenarios, Elland generously offered a high-level healing potion. As long as he could safely return home with the treasure, the potion was nothing.</p>
<p>The orc raised its voice, “Do we look like we are here to rob you?”</p>
<p>The orc’s haughty arrogance threatened to ruin the precious healing potion. In fact, the orc was fixated on Elland’s hand, which held the potion, prompting Elland to speak with a sense of urgency, just as the orc was about to toss it away.</p>
<p>“The guy who was protected under the sacred God created this. Please use this on your warriors for us. Please accept it.”</p>
<p>“How dare you feeble humans invade our domain!” the orc snarled.</p>
<p>He sputtered, “We heard that there was an agreement with the Dukedome and you guys, so…”</p>
<p>The orc interrupted, “It was a messy agreement, and it’s not for you guys.”</p>
<p>“I’m so sorry. We will leave as soon as dawn comes.”</p>
<p>The orc looked at the healing potion, then took a pouch off his waistline. It was filled with mana stones. Since the orc's fist was huge, the pouch he was holding looked relatively tiny. The same was true of the bottle with the healing potion, so it looked very small when the orc took it from Elland’s hand.</p>
<p>When the orcs completely disappeared into the darkness, Elland realized that he had no strength left in his body. His back had been soaked with cold sweat ever since the orc had handed him the pouch full of mana stones.</p>
<p>On his way back to the tent, he called Malus.</p>
<p>“They… seemed to have noticed.”</p>
<p>As Elland spoke, his voice quavered with fear. His formerly respectful demeanor towards the orc crumbled as soon as he stepped into the tent.</p>
<p>“Then, they would have attacked us earlier.”</p>
<p>“In general, yes. However, they are a Red-Faced Clan. You seem to have forgotten, but they are ferocious and clever.”</p>
<p>Elland put down the mana stone pouch that was given to him by the orc chief helplessly. Then, he added while staring at the pouch, “He left this… not to worry about them. But, they will come back soon.”</p>
<p>“As long as we hide the treasure, it will be fine. We should do that right now…” Malus suggested.</p>
<p>“No, they will check the traces from the historic site. They will find out that we have entered there.”</p>
<p>“They should have protected it well in the beginning!” Malus raised his voice.</p>
<p>“They have so many historic sites. Please take my opinion with a grain of salt. It is probable that the Red-Faced Orcs had already become aware that the relics of Saint Cassian were located there. This realization likely led them to seek agreement rather than resorting to war.”</p>
<p>“So they volunteered to be the shield.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. From the Duchy’s standpoint, there was no reason to reject the Red-Faced Clan’s offer to provide assistance.”</p>
<p>“Does that mean you knew that Saint Cassian’s remains were left at the site?”</p>
<p>“No way. It seems that the Lord has bestowed a fortune upon us.”</p>
<p>“As I have told you already, the Lord won’t give you more than one fortune.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m telling you. You are a person from the duchy, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but…”</p>
<p>“Then, how much do you love the Dukedom?” Elland asked.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“If the Red-Faced Clan gains possession of the treasure, they will retreat back to their continent without shedding blood needlessly. Then, the Duchy may be plunged into chaos again. I must apologize for telling you this, but the Duchy’s might is incapable of suppressing the Declans. On a day when the Declan Priest appears…”</p>
<p>Malus interrupted impatiently, “What are you talking about? Let’s just get to the bottom line.”</p>
<p>“The good thing is that we are in the border area of the clan. The number of Orcs rushing toward us won’t be very high.”</p>
<p>“Don’t beat around the bush and get to the point,” Malus snapped.</p>
<p>“Our contract is sacred in the name of God Lacryma. I hope you don’t violate it.”</p>
<p>Malus frowned immediately. “What the hell do you think I am? I said I would stay next to you rather we return or die. It’s cruel that you even mention the Lord.”</p>
<p>Elland grimaced. “As you know, I have been through so many assistants.”</p>
<p>“Ha…”</p>
<p>“In the face of a desperate crisis, you don’t seem to acknowledge the brilliance of the Lord Lacryma. It’s time for us all to think about the reason why the Lord gives us this ordeal.”</p>
<p>“You should have been a priest.”</p>
<p>Malus rose from his seat with an unpleasant look. Then, he added, “I will let it slide this time, but if you try to intimidate me in God’s name again, I won’t forgive you.”</p>
<p>“Then, please be prepared for God Lacryma’s divine protection.”</p>
<p>“...The God Lacryma’s divine protection.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Orcs born with combat capabilities were also good at ambushing. Thus it made more sense to prepare for a battle at their current spot rather than leaving the campsite and wandering around at night. It was a blessing if all their preparations just ended up being for nothing.</p>
<p>The worst outcome entailed the Declans being drawn to the battle by the scent of blood. Elland couldn’t shake off his assumptions, and the eerie silence only exacerbated his dread. He, Malus, and the other adventurers bided their time in the darkness, awaiting the opportune moment.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows. It wasn’t particularly tall, but it had a broad build. The being strode forward unaccompanied, seemingly having led the group from the front. The two crimson eyes embedded in the darkness were so vivid that they resembled malevolent spirits.</p>
<p>It was Malus who first checked the figure’s identity, and Elland confirmed it next.</p>
<p>“It’s… a human,” Malus opened his eyes as if he wanted to make sure that what he saw was right.</p>
<p>Elland nodded but remained vigilant because of the things he saw after. The muscular man’s massive physique was drenched in green blood, and his face was likewise splattered with the green blood of the orcs. This was similar to how Red-faced Orcs’ faces were covered in Declan's blood.</p>
<p>Then, the guy threw the body that he was dragging toward Elland. Elland and Malus looked at the body that fell in front of them. It was definitely the chief of the orcs that they had just talked to a few hours ago.</p>
<p>Elland finally grasped the situation.</p>
<p>The Lord doesn’t give blessings more than once? That is clearly false.</p>
<p>Otherwise, there was no way to explain their encounter with the hero strong enough to annihilate the orcs!</p>
<p>We are safe!</p>
<p>When Elland got up with a jubilant face…</p>
<p>“Not yet!”</p>
<p>The moment Malus yelled at Elland, a large shadow flew in at a speed that couldn’t be followed by the naked eye. The guy grabbed the top of Elland’s head with his hand and tried crumpling his face.</p>
<p>“SS-bul. Jin jja dook gae ne ing. (Shit. This is so fucked up!)”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 356</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee greeted me with a look of surprise. It appeared that she was ready to leave immediately for the accommodation, considering the car had been started already. When I closed the door after sitting in the passenger seat, she lowered the radio volume.</p>
<p>“I thought you went in there.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I sent Kwon Seong-Il.”</p>
<p>“Why?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I was blocked. My corps must secure my way in.”</p>
<p>Yes, I got this message when I tried to enter Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>[Your entry is being blocked by the power of the Old one. * Including the Gate]</p>
<p>[A command has arrived from your master, Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>[Secure the Access Road (Command)</p>
<p>The Old One has complete control over Star Dragorin, having created this battlefield by channeling its power. It’s where the Old One will make its final stand with fierce resistance.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, your master, the all-powerful Doom Kaos, has already achieved multiple victories. To prove your worth to your master, you must demonstrate satisfactory results, starting by infiltrating Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>* Occupy the Greenwood Continent’s ‘Whirlpool Land’ with your corps.</p>
<p>* Also, have your corps remove ‘Holy Knight Caldoran’ or other Holy Knights on earth. The Old One’s power in the Holy Knight will become yours and show you the way to get in.</p>
<p>If you succeed: The number of Old One’s corps attacking your mainland will decrease.</p>
<p>If you fail: The number of Old One’s corps attacking your mainland will increase.</p>
<p>Remaining time: Fifty days.]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee remained silent for a while after hearing the explanation, then said calmly, “The deadline is on June 10th.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When I sent Seong-Il to Dragorin, I gave him specific instructions to return promptly without any delay. However, shortly after his entry, the gate closed, and several minutes passed without any sign of Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Four hours later, he returned. At that time, I was waiting in the car under the hill with Yeon-Hee. Since there was no sign of danger, she also accompanied me.</p>
<p>Seong-Il was standing in a spot, slightly away from the lights that the agents had lit. Some wet towels were stained and dumped around him in a disorganized manner. He poured bottled water on his face and smiled at us as if things were ridiculous.</p>
<p>He had brought back many things, and one of them was an orc’s corpse. There were also two humans, who were barely alive. Seong-Il rose to his feet as the agents seized the humans.</p>
<p>He then gazed at the spot where the dungeon entrance had vanished and said, “I think we can go in and out as we want.”</p>
<p>Then, he handed me a microchronometer[1]. The passage of time in the Land of the Dead was completely different from reality, and the time here was the same. The amount of time that had elapsed on Seong-Il’s microchronometer, was equivalent to the time that had passed here.</p>
<p>“How did you reopen the entrance of the dungeon?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee turned away from the two humans to look at Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Seong-Il responded with a shrug, “I honestly freaked out because I thought I wouldn’t be able to come back. So I beat as many monsters as possible, then the gate reopened.”</p>
<p>I asked, “Who are they?”</p>
<p>He rolled his eyes. “Ugh, they were so clingy. They rushed into me, risking their lives. If I didn’t get your order to return quickly, then I would have destroyed their nuts.”</p>
<p>We walked toward the humans, and when I gave the agents a look, they took multiple steps back.</p>
<p>Seong-Il commented, “These fuckers use Night Eyes.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t just talking about the two different humans. Seong-Il added that he saw the same thing with the orcs.</p>
<p>He continued with his analysis, “These two were similar in strength to those at the end of the bronze section, while the dead monster was at the silver level. But that one was still considered the top three among the orcs.”</p>
<p>“You should have brought the orc back alive.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his nose after being scolded by Yeon-Hee. “I told you, noona. They are weak and pathetic. I honestly didn’t think it would get crushed that easily. Send me anywhere. I will get you thousands of humans and monsters.”</p>
<p>I rummaged through the items that Seong-Il had brought. Several pouches were entangled with each other and drenched in green and red blood. I could discern that they were filled with mana stones without even opening them as some had spilled out of the pouches.</p>
<p>When I kicked the orc’s body and turned it over so that its abdomen faced the sky, Seong-Il said, “I sliced open some of their stomachs, but none of them had any mana stones. It looks like they had gotten them by hunting and gathering from the Declans. Although they hadn't established the Mana Stone Bank, they had clearly invested effort in accumulating the stones.”</p>
<p>“Declan?” I asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il grinned. “I’m a master in smelling and figuring things out. I could smell them from afar. I tried to kill them all, but I returned as the dungeon entrance opened at that time. I suddenly remembered what you told me.”</p>
<p>“Anything special or abnormal things you noticed?”</p>
<p>He responded, “The air was definitely different as soon as I entered the space. I mean, not just air, but the vibe. I felt something really strong.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We were unable to enter the dungeon freely, and it didn’t lead to a labyrinth like the former dungeons. Instead, it was more like a small gate, a direct passage to Star Dragorin.</p>
<p>When Seong-Il had cleared all the monsters in the vicinity, the gate had opened, hinting at the possibility of a hidden quest, although there was no clear indication of what needed to be done. It was likely that the door would only open once a certain amount of destruction had been wrought.</p>
<p>Of course, we needed to experiment more and come to a conclusion in the future. When I looked at Yeon-Hee, she grasped my intention and moved.</p>
<p>The two people Seong-Il had brought over were Caucasians. One was in his early forties and the other was in his mid-thirties. Among them, Yeon-Hee’s first choice was a guy in his early forties. She sat down in front of him, then Seong-Il said as if he was giving advice, “There is not much of a difference, but the other seemed a bit stronger. The one with the scar under his eyes.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled but remained focused on her target. Her recovery skill emitted a bright white light that enveloped the man, and she finished her work by gently caressing his cheek.</p>
<p>The man struggled to open his eyes and repeatedly blinked as an LED light was shining directly on his face. When he finally looked at Yeon-Hee, her eyes turned black.</p>
<p>At that time, Seong-Il came out after changing his clothes. When I handed him a cigarette, he picked it up with both hands. As he lit his cigarette, he instinctively turned his head to the side, much like one would when drinking with an elder or in a formal setting.</p>
<p>When we were almost done smoking, Yeon-Hee tilted her head.</p>
<p>“It has been a little over a month since we came back, right? It’s so weird. I will have to look into the details, but it appears that for them, it has been an exceedingly long time since their return. It’s not just a matter of hundreds of years.”</p>
<p>I said, “Star Dragorin is the world that the Old One created as the last battlefield.”</p>
<p>She nodded. “Yes, so it has been a long time since the War of the New Devil.”</p>
<p>“The War of the New Devil? I think I know why you named it that way.”</p>
<p>“It’d be faster to show you instead of me explaining about this. What do you think?”</p>
<p>There was only one answer to Yeon-Hee’s two eyes asking for permission. I shook my head to express disapproval. Since joining Doom Kaos’s side… so since I acquired the position of Doom Man, Yeon-Hee had never entered my mental world.</p>
<p>She could sense the power lurking inside me when I responded to the priest's ritual ‘Transition’ by using three hundred points of Power and when I actually transitioned a dungeon. There was a cluster of dreadful energy sealed somewhere inside of me. All I could do with Power was respond to the rituals of the priests or open the gates. However, the energy generated by utilizing three hundred Power figures appeared to open up new possibilities.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a mere feeling, but a strong sense of certainty. It was likely that Doom Kaos had sealed the energy, which made the situation all the more ironic.</p>
<p>[* Also, have your corps remove ‘Holy Knight Caldoran’ or other Holy Knights on earth. The Old One’s power in the Holy Knight will become yours and show you the entrance.]</p>
<p>The command sent by Doom Kaos was teasing and tricking me that I would be able to fully absorb the power of the Old One from Holy Knight. Yes, my Power would increase, and if Doom Kaos felt it was necessary, it would give me new Power skills other than generating gates.</p>
<p>However, that was it. Similar to how the Awakened felt upon their return to the mainland, realizing that there were many things they were capable of, but unable to do so, they too felt the tremendous power that was sealed within them. However, they were constrained to using only the skills that Doom Kaos permitted them to.</p>
<p>If I could only discover the proper way to utilize the Power figures, or in other words, find a means to unleash my sealed strength! Then, the path to challenge the top Dooms would reveal itself. This could ultimately lead to my liberation from Doom Kaos's restriction while simultaneously maintaining peace on earth.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason why I didn’t let Yeon-Hee intervene in my mental world was that no one knew how the power sealed in my body would react to her intervention. I briefly explained this to Yeon-Hee, and she nodded that she understood.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the man in his mid-thirties appeared to have a hardened physique, with a loss of will to live evident in his eyes.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee continued, “The War of New Devil was a legendary battle for the leadership between Doom Kaos and the Old One in the Genesis of Star Dragorin, but it was not merely a myth. It was a true historical event. What makes it even more intriguing is the so-called Holy Knights emerged during the conflict. They were at the forefront of the war against the Seven Demon Kings, much like what we had done in the Stage of Advent.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee continued explaining through telepathy as she was conscious of Seong-Il.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Holy Knight Caldoran appeared in your command.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Does that mean they have been alive from the Genesis of Dragorin until now?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: I don’t think so. It seems that power had been transferred to the directives of the first Holy Knights, or they might have a system for that. Well… This guy doesn’t know much, but think about it. The funny thing is that he was caught by Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee smiled.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: The first Holy Knight is named Cassian, and he was the most powerful in the War of the New Devil. As I said, whatever I’m telling you now is based on this guy’s knowledge. Anyway, this guy found one page of the archives at a historic site. Then, Seong-Il caught him there.</p>
<p>Seong-Il suddenly whined, “Noona… I have a stomach ache. Ugh… I’m going to go shit first and come back. It’s my first poop of the day.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il ran funny. His stomach ache was simply an excuse, and it was clear that he did so intentionally as he sensed that we were communicating telepathically.</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Cassian not only dealt with the War of New Devil. A lot of Dragorin’s powerful magic and supernatural powers that resemble sorcery began from there. Cassian’s archives are a great treasure to them, but they are out of their luck. Mmm… But there is no need to be sad because they would have been killed by a flock of orcs if Seong-Il didn’t catch them. Those orcs over there are more intelligent than these people.</p>
<p>There were many things to hear from Yeon-Hee. The night was going to be long.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Anyway, is that all you can see from them?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Not yet. I need to get into the other one’s mental world.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Then, it would be better to check something before then.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Check what?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Whether or not our human firearms work on them or not. I’m really curious about that because they are not technically humans. They are aliens.</p>
<p>I signaled the agents briefly, after which they located cover and disengaged the safety of their rifles.</p>
<p>“What is that guy’s main weapon?” I asked.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee responded, “Sword.”</p>
<p>“What about skills?”</p>
<p>“He knows how to handle Mana. You will see.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Okay.”</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Wrath.]</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>I manipulated a few thunderbolts to maneuver a sword from the pile of items that Seong-Il had seized while he was in Star Dragorin. Then, the sword droppedl right in front of his leg. Although it was difficult to communicate due to the language barrier, he could feel the atmosphere.</p>
<p>I made sure he picked up the sword with his trembling hand before I reached out to the nearest agent. The agent didn’t grasp what I was asking for at first, but he soon realized when I pointed at his automatic rifle.</p>
<p>The agent placed the rifle in my hand.</p>
<p>1. An instrument for measuring very small intervals of time. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 357</p>
<p>Combat wizards with the light attribute were required to learn the essential skill called Blind Light. It directly impacted low-level monsters and blinded any higher-level monsters even if they were protected by shields or barriers.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the use of Blind Light frequently appeared in national wars as only a few warriors managed to attain a high enough level of Sense to use it instead of their eyes to see. Blind Light was a Circle Two, low-grade magic, but it was extremely versatile.</p>
<p>Smack!</p>
<p>A sudden stinging sensation on his cheek woke Elland up. As he attempted to open his eyes, he was met with a blinding intensity of light that he recognized as Blind Light. He wondered if the outsider was accompanied by a wizard.</p>
<p>He first tried to use Mana[1] to protect his eyes, but…</p>
<p>Sheek-</p>
<p>A woman’s face burst into his view. Under life-threatening circumstances, an individual’s capabilities and decision-making skills tended to become more heightened than usual. It all happened in a blink of an eye, but he could clearly see her face.</p>
<p>Her small face and beauty evoked images of the Rajania flower in his mind. He observed her raven-black hair and eyes, which were the distinct characteristics of outsiders. He had only heard stories about them and had never imagined that he would meet two of them in one day.</p>
<p>A random thought passed through Elland’s mind even though his situation was dire.</p>
<p>Do outsiders also use magic?</p>
<p>The giant outsider who swept his expedition party was similar to a barbarian warrior. Then, the light pouring down from the sky by Blind Light was used by that small woman.</p>
<p>The girl is a wizard!</p>
<p>As a swordsman, losing the close combat against the wizard would have been a disgraceful outcome. Strangely enough, his body, which had been severely injured by the barbaric outsider’s attack, had fully recovered and returned to its original state. Therefore, he tried to focus all his attention on her.</p>
<p>We should ditch that witch first, then figure out how to get out of here! Lord, please bless and keep me.</p>
<p>It was then he met the woman’s eyes.</p>
<p>Whoa!</p>
<p>Elland felt like he was falling into a void, but there wasn’t a physical sense of falling. However, the bright blinding light vanished in a second, and darkness filled the emptiness. It was pitch black, and he couldn’t see anything. His body was somehow quite stiff, so he couldn’t move. He wondered if this was how a prisoner felt when they were on the gallows with their limbs tied up.</p>
<p>After that moment, Elland’s spirit started to drift further into the distant past.</p>
<p>When Elland regained consciousness, it felt as though he had just woken up from a dream. The sequence of events that led a once immature young boy to devote himself to battling against the Declans and eventually organizing an expedition team in pursuit of fame and fortune felt like a hazy dream.</p>
<p>Although they were undoubtedly good memories, they now felt like dreadful nightmares to Elland, leaving him bewildered by the contradiction. He couldn’t find answers from his past life to explain why he was now standing on the ground with Blind Light once again pouring down upon him.</p>
<p>What the hell is going on?</p>
<p>Then, his vision began to return. Elland raised his head up unconsciously and realized that the light was radiating from the top of the iron structure that was attached to the ground.</p>
<p>It’s not Blind Light, but… it’s not even an artifact.</p>
<p>Elland was certain because if it were Blind Light, then he wouldn’t be able to see right now. He shifted his gaze in a hurry and looked around. He spotted two people first: the female outsider wizard and a young guy who had just appeared on the spot. Then, he saw other men over their shoulders.</p>
<p>They didn’t appear to be outsiders. They seemed to be from the continent where Elland was from, but they were hidden in rocks and trees while aiming their weapons at him.</p>
<p>There are no blades or spears, but they are definitely weapons.</p>
<p>Elland was confident in his assessment because the men had the eyes of highly trained soldiers who were ready to fight. Weapons were the only things that such men would use against him. If those things weren’t weapons, then they could have been Mana or artifacts that determined the authenticity of the curse.</p>
<p>“Skill eun? (How about the skills?)”</p>
<p>“Ma na reunr- da roor joor al a. Bo myun al guh ya. (Do you know how to deal with Mana? You will know when you see it.)”</p>
<p>Elland blinked and stared at the two outsiders who were speaking in their own language. Of course, he was unfamiliar with the language just as much as he was with their fashion sense. He didn’t understand anything, but he knew something unusual was about to happen.</p>
<p>He recalled the giant outsider who had killed the Orcs and stormed his expedition. The man and woman in front of him were bound to be the monster’s subordinates, and the men in the back looked like they had cooperated with the group of outsiders for a while. Therefore, the only one he could ask for help was…</p>
<p>Malus was lying on the ground a few steps away from him, but he appeared to be of little assistance. After all, he was still unconscious.</p>
<p>“G ruh ji. (That’s right).”</p>
<p>Right then, the voice of an outsider man was cut off. Elland’s eyes opened wide.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Elland was taken aback by the sudden appearance of lightning, particularly because the magic activated without the man uttering a single word. The unexpectedness had caught him off guard. The moment a sword bounced from the location where Malus was lying down, Elland felt like he was literally plunging into a whirlwind of chaos.</p>
<p>This is not a coincidence!</p>
<p>The man’s eyes were telling Elland to pick up the sword. He had never heard of outsiders possessing magical abilities, but even if “g ruh ji” was their incantation, he had undeniably witnessed the process of the sword falling before him by the man’s hand.</p>
<p>The lightning power sparked several times in the air as if they were teleporting, moving the sword toward Elland. He had never heard of a guy being able to control bolts of lightning that freely. Well, no. The Holy Knight who dealt with lightning could have managed it like that.</p>
<p>Holy Knight. Holy Knight? What a load of nonsense!</p>
<p>Elland looked at the sword that fell in front of him in a confused manner.</p>
<p>God, please be the witness of your creature. If you do so, I will give you all my property and the rest of my life to you.</p>
<p>Elland had no choice but to pick up the sword. He was a warrior before he was the head of the expedition party. He needed to do his best as he had Lord Lacryma’s protection. The Lord despised those who prayed without trying.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Some time passed.</p>
<p>It’s a weapon as expected…</p>
<p>Elland’s previous speculations were confirmed when the men behind the outsider man passed another weapon to him, making it clear that he intended to challenge Elland.</p>
<p>He even has the ability to handle lightning, but why…?</p>
<p>“A dda. O din gge suh- jik jub ha si neun guh yo? (Gosh, are you doing it by yourself, Odin?)”</p>
<p>Elland turned his head toward the sound and his eyes widened. It was the monster! He had wondered where he was, but he was there! The giant outsider!</p>
<p>He didn’t understand what the hell they were talking about, but it seemed like the giant monster was giving orders to the young outsider. The moment the towering outsider halted with his arm folded, Elland felt a great deal of pressure. He recalled the moment he first met the monster. With each expedition team member he seized and hurled, it appeared as though the entire world was on the brink of destruction.</p>
<p>Just thinking about the moment made Elland have goosebumps.</p>
<p>Why? Why are outsiders attacking us, and why are those people from the Greenwood continents cooperating with them? Why? Fucking why?</p>
<p>Suddenly, something he had forgotten flashed through his mind.</p>
<p>Ah! Saint Cassian’s Book of Records!</p>
<p>Elland inwardly cursed at his stupid self. He definitely touched something he shouldn’t have.</p>
<p>Saint Cassian’s record was divided into two categories based on the content. One was the history book that described the War of the New Devil in Genesis from Saint Cassian’s perspective.</p>
<p>The other document was a research report detailing both superlative magical abilities and swordsmanship. Acquiring and merging the contents of this book was crucial to the success or failure of the Holy Knight families, and completing the research was equally essential.</p>
<p>“T…This…”</p>
<p>Elland rummaged through his pocket with a hand that he didn’t hold the sword. His voice also trembled as much as his hand. Next, he pulled out a piece of paper from his pocket. To his surprise, the preservation magic that had been cast on it in the past was so potent that it still was completely intact without a hint of decomposition.</p>
<p>“Are you looking for this? But this is part of a history book.”</p>
<p>Elland was willing to confront the Red-Faced Orcs, but not the giant man who was folding his arms in front of him. Even if his two subordinates, the young man who freely handled the lightning power and a woman who used strange mental magic, didn’t step up, Elland’s life was in the hands of the outsider monster.</p>
<p>The treasure would lose all value as it was rendered useless upon his death.</p>
<p>Elland shouted again, “This is not what you guys are looking for!”</p>
<p>“Mok chung eun k ne- ing. (He is hella noisy.)”</p>
<p>“You should check and see it with your own eyes.”</p>
<p>If Cassian’s record book was something that could be torn and burned, then he would have escaped this situation by using it as an excuse. However, that was something that only the devil kings that were mentioned in Genesis could do.</p>
<p>Elland had no regrets, then crumpled the paper and threw it at the giant outsider. As it flew through the air, the conservation magic immediately unfurled the paper and made it flat again.</p>
<p>“Muh? Uh jjuh ra go. (So what?)”</p>
<p>With just a single glance, the giant man seemed to have finished evaluating it, and a perplexed, nonsensical grin spread across his face.</p>
<p>“You and I are both creatures of God. Although our skin and hair colors are different, our start was from God. I swear to the name of our Lord Lacryma, I will never tell what happened today to anyone. I swear. If I violate this, I will gladly accept the curse of the Demon King Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>Elland knew they wouldn’t understand him, but he shouted this earnestly.</p>
<p>“A dda. Si ggeu ruhb ne. Ji deul iee mun juh dum byu no ko. (Gosh, he talks too much. You guys are the ones who attacked first.)”</p>
<p>The giant outsider shifted his glance to the young male outsider.</p>
<p>“Joi song huh yo. Ju ddae moon in guh ga teun di… Bba jiguh sso. (I’m sorry. I think he is doing this because of me… I will step out.)”</p>
<p>What the hell is he saying to that guy? Please, please. Please take this and let me go.</p>
<p>1. A concept in fantasy and video games referring to a form of magical energy or power that characters can use to cast spells, perform abilities, or activate magical items. Apparently it’s one of the stats in this continent. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 358</p>
<p>After uttering something in an incomprehensible language, the giant outsider left while everyone else stayed behind. Elland became more anxious as the guy handling the lightning power and others remaining showed no sign that he was going to be let go. His anxiety mounted to the point where he had difficulty swallowing his saliva.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p>“So eum gi. (Suppressor)”</p>
<p>The guy wielding the lightning received a small metal tool from a man in the back and affixed it to the end of his weapon.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Electricity surged from the tips of his fingers, producing a stunning display of lightning bolts filling the air one by one. However, Elland’s realization dawned when the bolts converged and formed a mesh-like pattern in the sky, revealing the man’s true intention. He gasped.</p>
<p>He’s trapped the entire area!</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the area enveloped by the lightning mesh was large enough to move around in, Elland found no gaps to escape. As he observed the man’s skill over the electricity, Elland realized he was no match for him.</p>
<p>Elland said while holding a sword in his hand. “I gave you the treasure of Saint Cassian. D…do we really have to go this far?”</p>
<p>It wasn’t that there was no way to get out. If he could defeat the man, then the enchanted lightning mesh would dissipate with him. It appeared that the man wanted to bring out Elland’s full fighting potential as he made a gesture at him.</p>
<p>Is this really the end… This is how I die? Why me…</p>
<p>Elland noticed that he couldn’t avoid death because even if he tried decapitating the man, the witch wouldn’t just sit back and let him do so. Also, the giant outsider would be around and jump into him too!</p>
<p>Elland looked around, and the giant guy was actually staring at him from afar. His imposing figure appeared even more frightening, shrouded in darkness. Therefore, Elland noticed that begging for mercy on his knees wouldn’t help at all.</p>
<p>The eyes of those from the continent who cooperated with the outsiders trembled, but they were all weak even if they were protected by the Lord’s blessing. They would chicken out as soon as the giant guy roared.</p>
<p>Those from the continent who sided with the outsiders looked at Elland with quivering eyes, possibly out of guilt or pity for his predicament. Even with the Lord’s protection, they were feeble and would cower at the sound of the giant guy’s thunderous roar.</p>
<p>This must be the end…</p>
<p>No matter how many times he tried to devise an escape plan, Elland concluded that there was no possible way out. He completed his painful calculations and then channeled his Mana to its fullest potential.</p>
<p>Srrr.</p>
<p>His entire body and sword were immediately filled with warmth, and the sword turned a copper color. His blood coursed through his veins at an accelerated rate, leaving him feeling more alive than ever before. The beginning stage of his Sword User[1] had helped him survive multiple times in the past. Well… It was now guiding him to death.</p>
<p>Elland aimed his sword at the guy handling the lightning with a bitter taste in his mouth and a pounding heart.</p>
<p>“You may think it’s simple to take my life, but I guarantee that you will lose at least one limb. If you don’t exert yourself fully, then I will behead you right away.”</p>
<p>Although they wouldn’t understand what he was saying, he bolstered his own spirits. Then, he was able to shake off some of his fear of death by harnessing the power surging within him.</p>
<p>Right then, Elland’s attention was drawn to the movement of the man’s fingers, specifically the index finger inside the ring at the bottom of the weapon. He noticed that it moved slightly.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>He heard the sound of something colliding with each other.</p>
<p>What is he doing?</p>
<p>A sharp pain shot through his abdomen, quickly giving way to a burning sensation that radiated throughout the area. The sensation was familiar, and he had undoubtedly experienced it before.</p>
<p>“Ugh!”</p>
<p>Elland clenched his teeth and looked at where it hurt. Blood was flowing out from the cut. Despite the pain coursing through his abdomen, there was no indication that his body had been impaled by a sharp weapon or penetrated by a potent spell.</p>
<p>Ah, I let my guard down too much. What kind of artifact is that? I have never seen such a thing…</p>
<p>Elland regretted his initial belief that the man’s weapon was merely a weapon, realizing too late that it held formidable power. He had been preparing to focus his Mana when the man’s lightning power erupted. Although wizards used shields and swordsmen used barriers, both relied on the same fundamental principle of using Mana to create them.</p>
<p>As a result, people had to be careful in distributing their limited amount of Mana, but the opponent’s weapon ability was unbelievable. In fact, Elland wasn’t sure if the man’s attack started from that weapon. The pain continued to ravage his body and caused him to lose his composure, and he knew that his death was imminent.</p>
<p>That was why he was determined to emit all his Mana. One fortunate thing was that the opponent didn’t attack him again. The man watched Elland suffer with an indifferent gaze as though he was observing an experiment.</p>
<p>In a desperate bid, Elland channeled all of his Mana, risking his life. Then, a barrier enveloped his body while emitting a brilliant copper light as it materialized. Following that, additional layers with the same color light appeared and repeated the process.</p>
<p>In the past, Elland had always held tightly onto his sword when he led his expedition party into historic sites because of this. As much as he was driven by his desire to discover a relic imbued with the Lord’s holiness, he wanted to be surrounded by a radiant silver light from his sword even more. However, he knew that this dream would remain unfulfilled.</p>
<p>Elland starred at the man with rage,</p>
<p>“Bo ho mak. (Barrier).”</p>
<p>When the man mumbled to himself, Elland saw the chance to attack him for the first time.</p>
<p>He screamed and charged toward the man, “What the hell are you talking about?!”</p>
<p>The warm glow of copper enveloped him as he lifted his sword as high as he could. The radiant light seemed to be urging him on, encouraging him to take down his opponent. Elland believed that if his assumption that the opponent was a powerful wizard with lightning attributes was correct, then he still had a chance to win because it was a close-range battle!</p>
<p>The sharp and searing pain overwhelmed his abdomen, but Elland focused solely on his goal and pushed himself forward. He moved faster than he ever had before, spurred on by his own determination and willpower.</p>
<p>At the moment of life and death, swordsmen were known to push beyond their limits, and Elland was no exception. Despite the danger he faced, he felt a newfound confidence in his abilities and moved with a speed he had never achieved before. As he ran, he couldn’t help but wonder if this was what he felt like to reach the next level of Sword User.</p>
<p>When the Mana that he distributed throughout his body reached its maximum, it made his movements more precise than ever. He could feel himself slicing through the air like a blade. The pain that twisted his abdomen vanished instantly. Elland had actually shattered the wall to reach the intermediate level of Sword User. At last, he had achieved the same rank as Malus!</p>
<p>Nevertheless, things were going weird. Elland attempted to absorb the energy of Mother Nature into his body as more spaces were made due to the increased Mana. He believed that even the smallest amount he could manage would be beneficial in a moment of crisis. However, he was unable to sense any Mana flowing into him from Mother Nature.</p>
<p>What is going on?</p>
<p>Mother Nature had no Mana.</p>
<p>Is there something wrong with my body?</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he wasn’t in a situation where he could ponder about the situation. Because he was rushing in, Elland could see the guy’s face zooming in and that his neck was completely exposed. As he threw himself forward, his Mana flowed from his sword in an arc heading down.</p>
<p>I will strike him with a vertical blow, cleaving his skull from crown to groin. I will for sure witness his inner organs with my own eyes!</p>
<p>Elland raised his sword high. Next, the sound of his stomach being pierced drilled into his ears, and it continued unabated, with a sequence of explosive noises occurring one after another.</p>
<p>Tadadadadada-</p>
<p>Prior to that moment, Elland had solely been focused on defeating the man. As his vision became blurry, the sound seemed to taunt him, as if a malevolent entity were cackling at his impending death. The evil emitted a stench and expelled its saliva, which was coated with iron, in all directions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Tadadadadada-</p>
<p>My firearm’s barrel had become heated, permeating the air with the scent of burning charcoal, while the pungent smell of gunpowder lingered in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>The guy crashed on his way toward me. He was rushing in at quite a fast pace. Seong-Il said he would be around the bronze section if he was Awakened, but his speed was equivalent to those in the silver section when he ricocheted back.</p>
<p>If I had been standing closer to him, his sword would have fallen on my head. Well, of course, it wouldn’t have been able to even touch my hair anyway.</p>
<p>At that moment, he rose from the ground directly in front of me. The additional bullets had left him unscathed as I had stopped firing the trigger once I observed his shield beginning to shatter.</p>
<p>I checked his whole body again, but there was no item on him. He was holding a sword, yet it lacked the strength to withstand a defensive barrier. This indicated that the F-class shield he had just possessed was his own creation.</p>
<p>Slam!</p>
<p>I kicked him away, then asked Yeon-Hee telepathically.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Are there many people like him here?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: No, he is actually one of the strongest in that world.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: He made a shield by himself.</p>
<p>It was more than just a shield. Despite possessing physical abilities more akin to a civilian, his capabilities had surged instantaneously.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: That’s why I said you will figure it out when you see them in person. What do you think?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: It’s interesting. So you are saying that he is on another level in this world.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: If you consider those who can handle Mana as Awakened, it’s similar to our world. Most soldiers here can’t control Mana.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Our firearms will work to a certain extent.</p>
<p>Of course, I needed to ascertain whether firearms were operational in that realm and whether the Old One’s influence extended here. Yet, the shields they forged resembled the ones we used. The only distinction was that these individuals could craft them independently, whereas we required ‘items’ to use it. In terms of superiority, their capabilities extended beyond merely acquiring items.</p>
<p>When I turned my head, I made eye contact with Yeon-Hee. She appeared to be thinking the same thing that I did. Yeon-Hee’s eyes narrowed as she contemplated deeply.</p>
<p>“Ugh…” the man groaned.</p>
<p>The man took a lengthier amount of time to writhe on the ground while clutching his bullet wound.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Not here. I am unable to perceive the existence of what they refer to as Mana.</p>
<p>As expected, Yeon-Hee was thinking the same thing as me. She was devising a way to create our own shield without using items by gathering information from the guy’s memory.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>I knew what Yeon-Hee was expecting.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: No.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: It’s not just the shield. This is merely my assumption, but if Mana, as they call it, and the power bestowed upon us by the Old One are identical, it stands to reason that the power to create shields lies dormant within us. If we can feel and use it as much as they can, then our abilities will not be limited to items and skills.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was hoping that the Awakened could advance to this world. Although she knew that my Life Vessel was within her, she seemed to have decided that it was worth taking such an adventure.</p>
<p>However, my reason for stopping her wasn’t only because my resurrection depended on her. This was a battlefield where nothing was known yet. All we knew was that there were Holy Knights. Since we didn’t know anything about the Old One’s other troops, we couldn’t jeopardize her life as a bargaining chip.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Listen to me carefully. There is a Holy Knight family that created the Great Wizard, and their wealth of knowledge is likely substantial. There must be someone among them who has expertise not only in magic, but also in the truth of this realm. Whether we capture or visit them, we must investigate them at least once. You are not going to be under Doom Kaos forever, right?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Let’s think about it a little more. There is no need to hurry.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Then what are you keeping the returning stone for? Seon-Hu, it’s me. Mary, the Bitch. Do you think I won’t be able to pull myself out during an emergency?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee added.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: You were looking for a way to use your Power as well. Magic must be the answer. Trust your teacher, Seon-Hu. I will be the Grand Wizard.</p>

<p>Chapter 359</p>
<p>Ronsius was on the brink of offering aid to his long-term friend King Gemilan’s kingdom. Given their proximity to the Baclans, he concluded they would require more assistance than the dukedom. In addition, theduchy had already been stable following the arrival of the Red-Faced Orcs.</p>
<p>It would take him half a year to get to King Gemilan’s kingdom, so Ronsius was in a hurry from the early morning. The wagon he customized for himself resembled a small library. The Archmage Ronsius didn’t need an escort, but the reason why he prepared the family’s knights and wizards separately was to not be disturbed.</p>
<p>While he was packing Saint Cassian’s archives in his bag, his granddaughter came over.</p>
<p>“Count Stean is here.”</p>
<p>A group of people had come to visit him. One of the duke’s agents who had infiltrated Ronsius’s family must have already informed them. Though uncertain about their intentions for detaining him here, Ronsius remained resolute in his determination to help his friend this time.</p>
<p>“Tell them that I have been stuck in the lab for days.”</p>
<p>She sighed. “I already did, but they keep saying that they must see you right now.”</p>
<p>“Did they tell you what is going on?” he asked.</p>
<p>She nodded. “They said it’s about the Red-Faced Orcs.”</p>
<p>Ronsius heard earlier that there was a mysterious incident in the barony of Baran.</p>
<p>His granddaughter added, “Some people came from the temple.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think it’s a big enough deal for them to be involved… Put the wagon away first.”</p>
<p>“I have already done that. Count Stean and the priests are waiting in the guest room.”</p>
<p>When she was younger, she was an endearing child, but Ronsius’s strict discipline had caused her to gradually lose her charming smile. Instead, a stern, chilly demeanor was now settled on her face. Ronsius was always taken aback by her frigid countenance, but he knew it was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Her magical abilities surpassed those of any other family member, and she was likely to be the next generation’s Holy Knight. Therefore, training his granddaughter with strict discipline was only natural. However, it was heartbreaking that he couldn’t see her smile again.</p>
<p>After I die, this entire family will be yours. But you are a girl, so you have to be stronger, Sylvia. Can you not find joy there? Everyone wants to be you and envies you.</p>
<p>Ronsius swallowed the words he impulsively wanted to say as he followed his granddaughter from behind.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the guests stood up to show respect to Ronsius. As his granddaughter had mentioned, Count Stean had come to personally visit, and even the priests from the newly-built temple were in attendance.</p>
<p>The conversation started with a greeting along with some refreshments, then Ronsius heard an unexpected word.</p>
<p>“There was an oracle in Elsland, Mr. Ronsius.”</p>
<p>Even Ronsius’s granddaughter, who seemed to have lost her ability to feel, widened her eyes in surprise. The presence of an oracle from the Lord Lacryma denomination in the Great Palace of Elsland was a significant event.</p>
<p>Ronsius fixed his loose posture and looked at his granddaughter. As expected, his quick-witted granddaughter was leaving the room. Following that, all the other guests tactfully left except for one remaining priest.</p>
<p>“What kind of oracle is it that Elsland sent a message all the way here?” he asked curiously.</p>
<p>The priest grimly responded, “Elsland said, ‘the night is coming.’”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ronsius immediately suspended his plans to leave for King Gemilan’s kingdom.</p>
<p>Darkness is coming into this world…</p>
<p>The investigation team was set up by Count Stean and the duchy’s priest, and they said they had found clear evidence of the oracle at the site where the Red-Faced Orc Clan was slaughtered, at the southern end of the Baran barony.</p>
<p>In fact, the recent movements of monsters had been unusual. Ronsius had heard a rumor that a moving corpse was discovered in the Zeromia Sea between the south and Deathland. Some stories emerged that spoke of a ghost ship brimming with lifeless bodies.</p>
<p>Likewise, the reason why King Gemilan had solicited assistance was comparable. He cited that the Baclans had abruptly adopted sophisticated strategic tactics, making it challenging to get a victory.</p>
<p>Ronsius wrote a letter apologizing to his friend King Gemilan. Knowing that the king would have heard about the oracle, Ronsius candidly explained why he couldn’t make it there, stating that it wasn’t the opportune moment for him to be away for an extended period. He needed to restructure the family in accordance with the oracle’s guidance. The sentences that were similar to what he would have written during his heyday filled the letter.</p>
<p>A month had passed since Ronsius began restructuring the family, and on that day, he was inside the magic tower. The tower served two primary functions. It could be used to contact a specific wizard organization or to refer to the towers constructed within a structure that harnessed mana.</p>
<p>Ronsius’s magic tower encompassed both of these contexts. It served as the headquarters of a magical organization established by him and also as a structure that concentrated Mana. Not only was it far from his mansion with a river located in between, and it was placed in an area where there was no residence around it.</p>
<p>The area surrounding the tower was previously a barren wasteland. However, due to its function as a mana collection site, it had been transformed into a lush forest in just a decade. Looking down from the top of the tower, the surrounding area looked peaceful. The forests where wizards meditated in Mother Nature resembled the kingdom of ancient elves who used the forest as their base. It also appeared as if time had stopped.</p>
<p>However, there was no peace on Ronsius’s face.</p>
<p>Dadada- Dadadak-</p>
<p>Then a blood-soaked horse broke in toward the tower. Ronsius would not normally appear on the top of the tower, but he was throwing himself out of the window and flying down slowly like a falling leaf. Usually the wind pressure would have swept him up, but his gray beard and robe remained still as if nothing was happening.</p>
<p>The knight waited for Ronsius, the archmage and Holy Knight, to step down in front of him, then squeezed his voice out while enduring his pain, “T…the castle… castle collapsed… Please… p… please help us…”</p>
<p>Ronsius looked at the rose tattoo embedded in the knight’s chest. It was Baron Baran’s logo. The orcs wouldn’t have broken the agreement, so he wondered if the ‘night’ that the oracle mentioned a month ago had started.</p>
<p>Ronsius activated a spell inscribed deep inside his heart, causing a blue aura to fill his eyes as he muttered a brief incantation. As the energy dissipated, his eyes turned completely white, with the black pupils seemingly erased.</p>
<p>While his physical body remained in front of the knight, Ronsius’s consciousness was transported inside Baron Baran’s castle. He began to move around the castle with great haste. Things seemed to have progressed further than what the knight had described earlier.</p>
<p>Ronsius found the body of the decapitated baron. He was a luxurious man who loved jewelry, but nothing remained on his dead body except for blood. Ronsius felt no sympathy for his death as he wasn’t happy with him as a ruler of a territory. It was the same when he found the dead baroness and their kids not too far away.</p>
<p>Ronsius quickly passed through the bloody corridor and broke through the wall.</p>
<p>Seuk-</p>
<p>From above, Ronsius grasped the situation within a glance. The battle had concluded, and the invaders had successfully taken control of the castle. It was evident which side was which. The trapped individuals lined up on one side were from the barony within the duchy, while the victorious invaders were yelling at them from the other side. According to the oracle, they were the ones who brought the night.</p>
<p>But they look just like us.</p>
<p>Although they were dressed bizarrely, the invaders shared the same triumphant expressions as the conquerors in this world. They possessed the typical human features of two eyes, a nose, and a mouth, and stood firmly on the ground with two feet. They were unlike the hound-headed Declans or the ox-headed Baclans. That came as a shock to Ronsius.</p>
<p>I thought they would look like hideous monsters…but they are the same as us.</p>
<p>Ronsius discovered something else that was unusual. The number of intruders was too small. Aside from where they appeared, no matter how much he shifted his gaze to the distance, there was no such thing as a follow-up squad. A total of thirty of them were either beating up the prisoners or searching the inside of the castle. They were the only ones here.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the dead bodies of the baron’s soldiers were all over the place. He could find traces of powerful magic, and those swept away by it were destroyed. However, another thing that was indescribable was that other bodies looked intact.</p>
<p>Ronsius hastily turned his head.</p>
<p>Tadadadada-!</p>
<p>His attention was focused on the three invaders who were methodically searching the castle. More specifically, he was attuned to the clanging of the iron objects they were carrying, which emitted sparks.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>“Ahhh!”</p>
<p>Although none of the soldiers rushing toward the intruders belonged to the ranks of a Sword User, their unyielding fighting spirit remained steadfast even after the baron’s death and the fall of the castle. Ronsius was furious for the first time when he witnessed the scene of such soldiers dying in vain as he finally realized how the people with intact bodies had died.</p>
<p>Most of them died without being able to properly fire an arrow or throw a spear. It was heartbreaking to imagine how they felt.</p>
<p>Ronsius looked at the group leading the invaders. They were armed with artifacts. There were five of them total, and one exhibited the movements equivalent to that of a first-level Sword Expert could do, while the remaining four displayed movements that were equivalent to that of upper-level Sword Users.</p>
<p>One Sword Expert. Four Sword Users. Twenty-five soldiers carrying weird objects.</p>
<p>That was the formation of intruders, and Ronsius now faced a dilemma. If he used the Mana power concentrated in the tower, he could kill them as easily as they killed the baron’s soldiers. However, there were still many surviving prisoners in the castle. Therefore, that wasn’t the best choice.</p>
<p>I should burn them.</p>
<p>Ronsius blinked his eyes, and he returned to his original position. At the final blink, his pupils shifted to the center of his white eyes, indicating his rage at the sight of the massacre.</p>
<p>Right then…</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>A mysterious light rose over Ronsius’s head. He hadn’t given any special instructions, but all the magicians were going into the tower. But that wasn’t the end. They were moving the Mana concentrated in the tower.</p>
<p>Woooong-</p>
<p>The grass and leaves of the forest were leaning toward the tower as if they were blown by gale.</p>
<p>What the hell did they do?</p>
<p>Ronsius’s grey hair fluttered violently, and his sense of bewilderment intensified. He struggled to make sense of the situation at hand. It was highly improbable that a student would have the audacity to manipulate the tower’s Mana without his direction.</p>
<p>In addition, another absurd thing that was happening was that the baron’s knight was laughing wildly. He appeared as if he was about to die and fall off the horse, but he was standing on both feet and laughing at him.</p>
<p>Anyway, Ronsius realized that the tower’s Mana was beginning to form a barrier. This extensive barrier enveloped the entire nearby forest and served as one of the defense mechanisms established for when the tower was under duress.</p>
<p>The knight kept laughing at the back of Ronsius’ head as Ronsius was running toward the tower.</p>
<p>“Fucking old man. You have got something fun to play with, haven’t you? No one will be able to disturb us now. You can look forward to it,” the knight shouted.</p>
<p>“How dare you?!”</p>
<p>Ronsius turned his head, only to find his granddaughter Sylvia standing where the knight had been. She was even smiling, which Ronisus thought he would never be able to see. Although it was a mischievous smile, it momentarily caught him off guard.</p>
<p>Of course, it didn’t take long for him to realize that he was hallucinating. Ronsius was unsure of the origins of his hallucinations or what caused them, but he was convinced that the Holy Knight had fallen under the influence of a potent attacker capable of inducing such visions.</p>
<p>“Who are you…?” Ronsius asked the presence who was using his granddaughter’s face.</p>
<p>She responded in a taunting manner, “What kind of grandfather doesn’t recognize his granddaughter?”</p>
<p>The presence that resembled his granddaughter then laughed and whispered. Ronsius had never encountered someone who dared to taunt him since he had achieved the rank of Holy Knight, so the experience sent shivers down his spine. To make matters worse, the opponent seemed entirely at ease even in the presence of a Holy Knight who was also an archmage.</p>
<p>At that time, an eerie thought passed through Ronsius’s mind. When he looked back at the wizards through the windows of the tower, the presence in the face of Sylvia whispered again.</p>
<p>“It’s no use. Who do you think gave instructions to your men? To them, I’m the Holy Knight Ronsius. You are the villain. So let’s not lean on them, and just play amongst ourselves.”</p>
<p>“Just answer the question. Who are you…”</p>
<p>“The game depends on it. Will you ever find out my name?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 360</p>
<p>All-source Situation Room at the World Awakened Association Headquarters.</p>
<p>The general situation room was filled with subtle blue light from a large monitor. On the five hundred-inch long monitor, the program presented the location of the Awakened as a dot on the world map, which was connected to a Geographic Information System (GIS). Many of the dots were disappearing as the Awakened were entering the other world at the moment.</p>
<p>However, the information presented wasn’t detailed. Most of the dots overlapped because the location of the Awakened was displayed as dots.</p>
<p>Lee Ga-Hee didn’t have the authority to handle the central monitor, so she couldn’t zoom in to a location and split the monitor to show the personal information of the key Awakened. That was solely the responsibility of the head of the situation office to lead the department by displaying information on a large monitor. Therefore, Lee Ga-Hee was a mere employee who had been dispatched from the Korean branch to the general situation room of the association’s headquarters.</p>
<p>Like everyone else, Lee Ga-Hee was also watching the monitor. Awakened from other countries were among the groups of three or five moving dots.</p>
<p>However, she wasn’t paying attention to the Awakened of foreign nationalities who had entered Korea. After all, those people were subsidized by conglomerates groups such as Jeonil, Ilsung, and Daehyun. In addition, they had been approved to use the passageways open to Korea.</p>
<p>「World Awakened Association, “First Day of Extraterrestrial Arrival, a Monumental Step.”」</p>
<p>Furthermore, she wasn’t listening to the media talking about how long they had been waiting for this day. One of her duties was to send the location of the Awakened to the Security Bureau if they committed a crime, so keeping a close eye on breaking news was one of her tasks.</p>
<p>Then, information about a dungeon in Korea grasped her attention.</p>
<p>「 Registration number: A - 92</p>
<p>Location: Ronsius Holy Knight (Franklin Dukedom, Greenwood Continent)</p>
<p>Status: Entering」</p>
<p>That was the only dungeon in Korea that was in an entry state. Lee Ga-Hee had not heard about it before.</p>
<p>It was the first day of the Awakened entering the extraterrestrial space. She knew that the association had established a reconnaissance team composed of parties and attack teams with significant private capital. Consequently, she was designated as a mandatory checkpoint that these teams had to go through before entering.</p>
<p>What if there was an error in the middle? What if the Korean branch is making a mistake?</p>
<p>Although the association practiced a lot using the first day of entry as D-day, it was inevitable that mistakes would happen on the first day. Lee Ga-Hee was suspicious that that would have been the case now.</p>
<p>「 Not permitted to log in. 」</p>
<p>She raised her hand, looking at the message. A man with broad shoulders walked over quickly from a distance. The middle-aged man was the chief of the department.</p>
<p>“It’s obvious that you can’t access it because it’s an operational area within the association. But good catch. Keep up the good work.”</p>
<p>After relaxing a bit, Lee Ga-Hee recalled that the chief was a general who was in a high position in the U.S. Department of Defense. She felt like she was in the middle of a huge military operation.</p>
<p>As she looked around, she noticed details that had escaped her notice earlier due to her tension. Lee Ga-Hee was under immense pressure to avoid making any mistakes, identify any flaws, and make significant contributions to the association. The high-tech facilities in the situation room, combined with the presence of individuals dispatched from branches worldwide, added to the already heightened tension. On top of that, men with guns that she would have seen only in movies were standing guard next to each door.</p>
<p>She somehow felt like her body was heating up. Her heart pounded, and her fingertips tickled with a strange excitement. She noticed that where she was, where different languages were spoken all over the place, was the most secretive place in the world right now. She was proud of herself for taking part here.</p>
<p>Right then her phone rang with a notification message. An encrypted chat window popped up on the screen.</p>
<p>「Entry Plan</p>
<p>Entry Zone: No. E-49 (Baron of Baran, Franklin Dukedom, Greenwood Continent)</p>
<p>Entry Date: May 22, 2018, 14:00</p>

<p>2018. 05.10</p>
<p>(Co) Jeonil</p>
<p>Approval Code - DK2018511AW」</p>
<p>Lee Ga-Hee put extra pressure on her fingertips as she entered the approval code.</p>
<p>Click, click.</p>
<p>The personal information of the five members of the association was displayed on her personal monitor. She expanded the map of the area in Suwon City, registered as E-49, then began to send out the location where five dots disappeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Room One, World Awakened Association Korea Branch.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin, the Director of Room One, was having a meeting with an uninvited guest.</p>
<p>The time has come.</p>
<p>The guest was the senior vice president of Daehyun Group, Jeong Woo-Seok. Yoo Won-Jin had only seen his name on the approval documents. He had never seen him in person before, as Jeong Woo-Seok never made an appearance at the company headquarters.</p>
<p>“Director Yoo is from our group, so I thought you would take care of us, haha.”</p>
<p>However, Yoo Won-Jin didn’t feel any pressure from Jeong Woo-Seok as various figures from the business community had been in contact with him since he moved his work to the association.</p>
<p>The best meeting he remembered was with the President of Finance, Park Choong-Sik. There were rumors about his death, but the old man showed off his robustness a lot. Remembering the meeting with him, Jeong Woo-Seok was no more special than anyone else. Thanks to the information that he naturally learned while focusing on the association’s work, there was no hint of any walls of status between them as they had already been broken down,</p>
<p>“Hmm… Why are we not getting the approval?”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin sympathized with Jeong Woo-Seok’s apprehension. Although the information had not yet been released to the media, there were sources available to large corporations who kept their ears to the ground.</p>
<p>The association’s plan to open up an era of space colonization was a profit-making venture, which included an internal directive that they would not get involved in matters related to land and resource ownership. The directive resembled the practice during the age of navigation, where explorers would claim by planting a flag, thereby declaring it to belong to their conquering group.</p>
<p>The association only wanted one thing from the Awakened: conquer the extraterrestrial space.</p>
<p>“I don’t know the details of the conditions for approval, but I just wanted to let you know that it may seem unfair on the surface.”</p>
<p>“Today is only the first day.”</p>
<p>“But none of our plans have been approved.”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin spread his hands open. “Why are you telling me this? I don’t have that much power. I’m just an employee. And wouldn’t it be safer to wait for the other attackers to return and gather more information about the aliens before entering?”</p>
<p>“That’s what we think. The Awakened are in a different position. They will think that the association is depriving them of opportunities.”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin shook his head inwardly as he couldn’t say that only the Awakened who were hired by the Daehyun Group thought like that. The capital forces that reached the association’s leadership had one thing in common, whether they aggressively lobbied or utilized their connections to gain influence. It was that the entry plan they submitted was concentrated in a place called Franklin Dukedom.</p>
<p>In fact, not long after, higher-ups issued an instruction to approve only the plan for the Franklin Dukedom.</p>
<p>“Director Yoo… Did we get on the wrong side of the association?” Jeong Woo-Seok asked.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin responded, “No way. Even if there were any biases, the association is fairer than you might think. Once the returnees are back, the guidelines for granting approval will naturally become clear.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you think one day will determine ten years… no one hundred years?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I won’t change the subject. You would know that we have a lot of defense companies in our group. We have plenty of room, so I’m confident that we will be able to do much more than Jeonil if we advance to outer space. Then, when that time comes, I will never forget how much of a help you were. If it’s actually hard for you to do, then just connect me to one person, please. I heard he is Korean.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Vice President!” Yoo Won-Jin raised his voice without realizing it, then he lowered his voice as he was conscious of the people outside of the room. “You’d better not talk about him because I can't even talk to him.”</p>
<p>“That’s how urgent I am. Jeonil has literally devoured this country. What about Jonathan Investment Finance Group? They took control of the world. If the higher-ups really think that they should also monopolize outer space… What can I do? I have no choice but to stop.”</p>
<p>At that time, Yoo Won-Jin received a short message.</p>
<p>「 Honey, I’m out at the shopping mall with the Daehyun President’s wife. I won’t be late for dinner. Sorry! 」</p>
<p>Ugh, she is doing this again. Stop. Just stop hanging out with her.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin quickly straightened his crumpled expression and raised his head. Then, he saw Jeong Woo-Seok’s anxious face. A new era of navigation unfolded, but he was unable to move to the sea despite the multiple ships he possessed.</p>
<p>What Jeong Woo-Seok said was true. The number of entries processed by the Korean branch today was only one of Jeonil’s squads.</p>
<p>On the other hand, the situation on the foreign side was active. There was already a famous figure in this world. His name was Chris, a Wall Street financier who had hit the jackpot on the Day of Advent, and he said he built the system and manpower faster than anyone else. The performance of foreign capital, led by him, was remarkable.</p>
<p>But isn’t the Jeonil Group, the only one who has entered space, technically a foreign capital?</p>
<p>Although the Ilsung Group was scheduled to enter in a few days, it was far short in light of the current status of active foreign capital.</p>
<p>Shouldn’t we have at least one more in Korea besides Ilsung?</p>
<p>Upon reflection, Yoo Won-Jin realized that Daehyun Group would never be able to directly contact the association’s leadership. In the eyes of the super-wealthy figures in the business world, such as the King of Hell Jonathan Hunter, or Osiris Jonathan von Karjan, the Daehyun group would be considered insignificant.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin made a decision.</p>
<p>“It’s a fact that will be known to the public soon.”</p>
<p>When Yoo Won-Jin opened his mouth, Jeong Woo-Seok corrected his posture and paid attention.</p>
<p>“This approval is limited to the Franklin Duchy…”</p>
<p>“Franklin Duchy… Why?”</p>
<p>“It must be a small country. The higher-ups must intend to settle first and gradually expand the realm of humanity there.”</p>
<p>“T…then, how many dungeons are left in Korea?”</p>
<p>“There is none left. There would be nothing even if you look abroad.”</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin refrained from mentioning that the allocation had already been decreased due to foreign capital. Jeong Woo-Seok’s face began to regain hope when he noticed Yoo Won-Jin’s smile and the way his upper body was tilted toward him. Yoo Won-Jin’s voice was so quiet that Jeong Woo-Seok could barely hear him by putting his ears close to his mouth.</p>
<p>“Try modifying your entry point to the Land of Whirlpool. Before it gets too late.”</p>
<p>Jeong Woo-Seok was touched.</p>
<p>The approval guidelines of the Land of Whirlpool were just released this morning. The leadership of the association seemed to believe that they would easily occupy the Franklin Dukedom.</p>
<p>Yoo Won-Jin wondered how many years would it have taken for him to obtain such authority and social status if he had remained in the Daehyun Group. Under the assumption that he would never be kicked out after dedicating his entire life, he would have been barely promoted.</p>
<p>In that sense, moving to the association was a successful gamble.</p>
<p>“We will see each other more often in the future, Mr. Vice President.” Yoo Won-Jin stretched his hand out to shake hands. “Going to outer space is important, but you’d better take care of your health first.”</p>
<p>Jeong Woo-Seok held Yoo Won-Jin’s hand with both of his hands.</p>
<p>“I will…never forget your help.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and Seong-Il had left, but I remained at that spot in case of a possible crisis. I hoped that I would be able to wear her down, but things had progressed such that we agreed that we would bring the entire Franklin Dukedom to war and then I would be accompanied by Seong-Il.</p>
<p>It was almost time for darkness to fall, and nights in the hills came faster than flat land. The area around the A-92 dungeon, which led to the Holy Knight Ronsius’s area, had been left empty from the beginning, so it was natural that there was no light in the darkness like other areas.</p>
<p>「Warning</p>
<p>Civilian Restricted Area</p>
<p>This area is subject to the World Awakened Association Membership Agreement and people are strictly prohibited from entering the area outside of accreditation.</p>
<p>World Awakened Association」</p>
<p>Ssss-</p>
<p>As I traversed the barbed wire that was marked with the warning sign, I caught sight of some red lights. The reddest of the bunch emerged from the depths of the necromancer’s hood, shrouded in darkness. As Joshua’s crimson gaze dissipated, the members of the plague squad who trailed him arrived with their heads lowered.</p>
<p>Their presence exuded a sense of darkness even though they didn’t make a grim sound. Even Seong-Il often avoided Joshua, saying that he felt overwhelmed by Joshua’s eyes.</p>
<p>I had no doubt that these people who gave off such a nightmare vibe would open the door for me to enter the world of Franklin Dukedom. Other than for Yeon-Hee, they had the strongest firepower out of all the Awakened.</p>
<p>I said, “You should know what you need to deal with.”</p>
<p>Joshua responded immediately, “Holy Knight Caldoran of the Land of Whirlpool. I will cut his head and offer it to you.”</p>
<p>I had purposely set the dungeon with the closest passage to the Holy Knight aside.</p>
<p>I continued, “Go to the Cat Food Warehouse before entering. You will be able to check your equipment.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Master,” Joshua said.</p>
<p>The Holy Knight would have no idea what was getting closer to him, so Caldoran would be pitiful as much as the one who was facing Yeon-Hee now.</p>
<p>I looked at Joshua, who was already filling the darkness inside his hood with murderous intentions, then nodded briefly. Joshua and his squad vanished within one second as if they were the gods of death who didn’t exist in this world.</p>
