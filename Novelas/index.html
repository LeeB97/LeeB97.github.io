<p>Nonetheless, the things that captured his immediate attention left him questioning how many soldiers would be able to retreat even if he ordered them to do so.</p>
<p>At that moment, Lanceran made eye contact with a female vampire. She was soaked in blood, but she was wearing a dress that could be seen at a social party. Apart from chasing the Vampire Lord’s blood mass, Lanceran couldn’t even stop her from smirking and jumping into him.</p>
<p>She purred, “You must have already fallen in love with my beauty, darling.”</p>
<p>That was the last voice Lanceran heard before losing consciousness.</p>
<p>#2 - Central and East of the Greenwood Continent (Barien Empire)</p>
<p>Apollo[1], William Spencer, was filled with anxiety as the progress on his side was significantly slower in comparison to Deborah Bellucci’s forces. His heart pounded with concern. The spoils of war Deborah gained by destroying the old Ronsius magic towers were considerable, and she was also leading the coalition forces closest to the imperial capital. Naturally, the one who planted the flag first became the owner.</p>
<p>The association didn’t care how the land was governed. When William heard that Deborah had immediately conscripted all adult men in the first conquered territories of the empire, he was filled with regret and self-blame.</p>
<p>Deborah was ranked the sixth strongest in the group, and he was ranked seventh. The gap between them wasn’t huge, but it was evident that Deborah was gradually widening it. What if she ended up occupying not only the high-class items from this alien land, but also from the imperial capital?</p>
<p>“I have confirmed it.”</p>
<p>It was about what kind of agreement the corps of Hera, Deborah Belluci, had made with the coalition groups.</p>
<p>“Hera had only one request for the coalition groups. She would clear the way and share everything left on that land…”</p>
<p>William understood the situation even without hearing the rest of that sentence.</p>
<p>He interrupted, “She claimed ownership of the residents in the capital of Dragorin, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>Deborah Bellucci’s corps wasn’t aiming to occupy the capital. Instead, their goal was to destroy the city, plunder items and gold, then gather slave soldiers. Pillaging was the right term to use to describe what she was doing.</p>
<p>He ordered grimly, “There will be nothing left if we are late. Summon all group leaders, without exception. Right now.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>#3 - Central and East of the Greenwood Continent (Barien Empire)</p>
<p>Rat-tat-tat. Rat-tat-tat.</p>
<p>The sound of guns firing at the target was loud, and the mercenary Jimmy was dizzy with the smell of gunpowder.</p>
<p>It was just yesterday when his group joined other groups. There seemed to be an agreement among the group’s leaders that a joint operation was necessary to capture the fortress in front of them instead of relying on individual attacks.</p>
<p>The two hundred groups had no choice but to be allied together as the Barien Empire’s firepower was on another level compared to other dukedoms. They used towers with supernatural power to form defensive lines and knew how to use flying beasts as their tactical helicopters.</p>
<p>Thus, more than two hundred groups were working together now, which meant over three thousand people had united into one corps. Jimmy was one of those mercenaries, and he was responsible for eliminating deserters coming from the frontlines.</p>
<p>It was quiet after a round of fire. Jimmy thought it was fortunate that it was night. Although the area was brightened by star shells and magic performed by the enemy's wizards, most of the gruesome scenes were quite hidden in darkness compared to the cruel starkness of daytime.</p>
<p>It was unbearably humid probably because of the blood that had been sprayed around for days. Jimmy and his fellow mercenaries took advantage of the lull to spread wood chips on the trenching ground. The corps had been formed all of a sudden, and they never imagined they would end up fighting in the trenches.</p>
<p>Jimmy unfolded a garbage box on the ground as his resting spot.</p>
<p>The biggest problem wasn’t the deserters fleeing from the frontlines of the enemy side. Instead, there were the magical spheres. They were objects that made Jimmy and the mercenaries unconsciously check the sky every now and then. They were coming from the imperial fortress, where the Awakened were attacking. When they exploded, they caused an enormous force to impact the surroundings.</p>
<p>There were rumors that people would bring in mortars later, but it wasn’t confirmed unless they were set up right in front of them.</p>
<p>Jimmy rubbed his eyes as he was quite sleepy, and talked to the mercenary beside him, “Isn’t this quite different from what we were told?”</p>
<p>“Have you not heard that the Declans were spotted?” responded the other guy.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, I mean, how can this be considered a small-scale operation?”</p>
<p>The mercenary smirked, “The Awakened must be furious that Hera’s team hit the jackpot.”</p>
<p>He frowned slightly. “Deborah Bellucci.”</p>
<p>“Yes, her.”</p>
<p>The conversation stopped there as the mercenary pointed at the commotion behind their back. Jimmy turned his head back, and a small-sized team had joined the coalition. They were Asians.</p>
<p>Jimmy couldn’t make his eyes turn red like the Awakened, so he frowned and narrowed his eyes to focus his vision on them. Then, he realized why their appearance had caused such a commotion.</p>
<p>Those joining were neither Japanese nor Chinese. Instead, they were from Odin’s home country. The group’s leader had given two hundred million dollars to his ex-girlfriend’s family as she had passed away in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>“Caliber.”</p>
<p>Jimmy deliberately lowered his voice.</p>
<p>“Wow, Caliber is showing up too? Our frontline will be organized much better now.”</p>
<p>Caliber shouted in Korean as soon as he stepped in. The application on the device had more issues translating Korean than the Dragorin’s language, so the guy in front of Caliber was struggling.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Jimmy didn’t believe in the image that the media created of Caliber. Even though his son had portrayed him humorously in his clips and Caliber had demonstrated his faithfulness, he still held the title of the world’s sixth most powerful Awakened. The world of Awakened was not a place where anyone could climb up to that position easily.</p>
<p>Even then, Caliber’s voice was ringing loudly.</p>
<p>“Ah jik gga ji han gook mal mo r― myun uh jji ja gooo― yu gi dae jang, noo goo yu. leader. leader. leader mal lee yu.”</p>
<p>Jimmy muttered, lowering his posture into the trench, concerned that he would make eye contact with Caliber.</p>
<p>“Well, the mortar is here.”</p>
<p>He whispered as much as he could.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Indeed, Caliber quickly advanced to the front line with the speed and force of a projectile that was being launched from a mortar.</p>

<p>Chapter 399</p>
<p>#32 ― All-source Situation Room, the World Awakened Association (Mainland)</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han was sitting in the situation room.</p>
<p>「Entrants: 33,914」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「Entrants: 33,921」</p>
<p>The speed of entering Dragorin had noticeably slowed down, which was a natural phenomenon as all the open dungeons were exhausted. He called the Director of the Office and ordered them to advance to the second opening immediately.</p>
<p>The first opening was limited only to the emperor’s direct territories, while the second opening was applied throughout the seven imperial territories. The association’s plan involved assembling teams of strong Awakened in the challenger and master sections and using them to create battlegrounds in the imperial capital. Once the enemy’s defenses were weakened, they would then launch attacks and deploy more Awakened to their territory.</p>
<p>「Entrants: 34,217」</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>「Entrants: 41,593」</p>
<p>The rate at which the scoreboard numbers were changing started to increase rapidly.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Not only outer space but also the real-time situation of the association’s headquarters was included. I thought that that piece of footage would be the last one, but…</p>
<p>Does Doom Kaos have thousands of eyeballs on its body?</p>
<p>Each video clip showcased a different offensive force invading various parts of the Barien Empire, like thousands of puzzle pieces. However, once combined, the full picture of the Barien Empire being consumed by the flames of war would become clear. One of the two most formidable nations was screaming and dying just like the central area of the Greenwood Continent had.</p>
<p>The last scene was an Awakened fighting the Grand Master of the empire, and the video zoomed into the Awakened’s furious red eyes.</p>
<p>[Wow~ Doom Man’s human forces are strong and burning with fighting spirit. The master is satisfied.]</p>
<p>The Man Who Overcomes Adversity had deactivated. Time had passed while I was watching all sorts of videos, so I was now fatigued.</p>
<p>[By the way, the human force has gone into override to serve their master, but what are the other corps doing? Since the human corps is leading the way, shouldn’t they be assisting and moving in response to them? I, Lunea, am honestly disappointed. Oh, not me. Doom Kaos is disappointed in you guys. Ah. Ha. Ha. Ha.]</p>
<p>Lunea kept talking incessantly, and I couldn’t tell if it was relaying Doom Kaos’s messages or simply being carried away by the thrill of becoming a Doom and was unable to stop talking.</p>
<p>However, I could understand why Doom Kaos had given such a high position to it. It was a hint that Doom Kaos would be more directly involved with us in the future. What it would have truly wanted to say was to prevent internal conflicts in advance and focus on the war that had just begun.</p>
<p>[Okay, then. Let’s chant for the last time. Eternal Loyalty to our almighty master, Doom Kaos― ٩(๑˃ꇴ˂๑)و]</p>
<p>The meeting was finally over, and I heard voices following Lunea’s words from stairs below and above me. I joined them as I didn’t mind acting like this as long as this would end the conference.</p>
<p>“Eternal Loyalty to our almighty master, Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>[Are you not going to lower your head, Doom Man?]</p>
<p>This asshole…</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I returned to the mainland as soon as I got back from the coast. The object that I sent to Yeon-Hee didn’t contain harmful energy, but the one I sent to Lee Tae-Han’s office did.</p>
<p>As I pushed open the gate and stepped into the office, I was met with a surreal sight. Lee Tae-Han’s workspace was awash in deep red energy, and all the neighboring offices on the same floor appeared to be deserted.</p>
<p>The Awakened from the association was restricting access at both ends of the corridor, then they hurriedly lowered their heads as soon as they glanced alternately between the gate that was still open and me. The bloody crimson energy had already withered up to Lee Tae-Han’s office door.</p>
<p>“Odin has returned. He is right in front of us now.”</p>
<p>As I had seen from Doom Kaos’s video, Lee Tae-Han was in the situation room, overseeing the entrance into the empire.</p>
<p>I collected the bone ring and waited for Lee Tae-Han to come over in order to briefly explain the situation to him.</p>
<p>However, Yeon-Hee arrived first. She was fully armed, ready to jump into the frontlines of the battlefield at any moment. Her anxious eyes looked at me.</p>
<p>She babbled, “I thought you were in danger.”</p>
<p>Then, she pulled out half of the ancient dragon’s heart, but the shape of it, which was originally a hilt of the broken sword, had been altered into a mundane form resembling cooled lava.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Half of the Great Red’s Heart has been added.]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere has been removed.]</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>When I was about to tell her about it, she spoke first.</p>
<p>“I was going to enter the gate if I still didn’t hear anything from you by the end of today. With Jonathan and Lee Tae-Han.”</p>
<p>I explained briefly, “There was a meeting, and all Dooms were gathered in one place.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee nodded her head while focusing on the surroundings. She appeared to be conscious of the energy of Doom Entegasto that had spread when the bone ring was left alone in the office.</p>
<p>Her gaze slowly moved to my fingers, then she frowned after noticing how my golden energy and Doom Entegasto’s bloody red energy were intertwined.</p>
<p>“It was the energy coming from that, right?” she asked.</p>
<p>I nodded. “They would have taken it away if I brought that to the meeting. Doom Entegasto would have ground his teeth, waiting for the right time to kill me.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t laugh at Yeon-Hee’s serious face.</p>
<p>“Is that his stuff again?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>A knowing look appeared in her eyes. “I know what is going on. I guess you were experienced in hiding cigarettes when you were in middle school, right?”</p>
<p>She let out a laugh as if she had now relaxed.</p>
<p>The conversation then turned to the bone ring. After explaining that I needed to raise my Common Power to use this, I told her about the ‘Expansion of Life Vessel Usage Ability.’</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee showed more interest than when she learned that the bone was made from the bones of Doom Entegasto. With her eyes wide open like a surprised bunny, she was deeply immersed in the bone ring, unable to take her eyes off it.</p>
<p>I knew what she wanted. The reason why she couldn’t enter outer space immediately even though I was potentially in a dangerous situation was that she possessed my immortal vessel.</p>
<p>“Expansion of Life Vessel Usage Ability is…”</p>
<p>As expected, her voice was full of anticipation.</p>
<p>I cautioned, “Nothing has been confirmed.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were bright. “But there is a possibility that we can move the vessel. So, if we can, then…”</p>
<p>I replied instantly, “Right. If we can move the vessel, then I will consider other options.”</p>
<p>Outer space was an incredibly dangerous terrain, so I made the excuse of needing the Life Vessel to keep her tied to the mainland and prevent her from venturing into it. If she encountered the transcendents, then there was no way for someone as powerful as her to survive.</p>
<p>However, upon Yeon-Hee’s most recent visit to the auction, I realized that her demeanor was not simply one of boredom. Her calm expression seemed to indicate that the motivation driving her life was waning.</p>
<p>Besides being my lover, she was the top Awakened in the world. I knew that she was extremely proud of that, so she wouldn’t even hesitate in moving the vessel to another person. If the constraint called the Life Vessel were gone, then she would be free. Moreover, the world was noisy with the large-scale expansion of outer space entries through the Barien Empire.</p>
<p>She would have heard many things.</p>
<p>“Are you sure?”</p>
<p>“Just wait a bit. We will know once we catch two more Dragorins. It won’t take long.”</p>
<p>I was also hoping that the bone ring had the ability to move the vessel as much as she did. Finding a safe vault like Yeon-Hee was the next problem.</p>
<p>When Yeon-Hee regained brightness in her face, a strong presence approached the room. At first, I thought it was Lee Tae-Han, but I felt a presence from the opposite direction of the situation room, outside the building. Furthermore, based on the disappearing traces of the distorted space, I was able to confirm his identity.</p>
<p>There were only a few Awakened with returning stones. It seemed that the news of my return to the headquarters had reached Jonathan through several people’s mouths. As expected, I heard him call my name from afar. His voice echoed from outside the building and traveled through the walls.</p>
<p>- Sun!</p>
<p>It was Jonathan. He entered, dressed in a suit. All traces of his past reign on the skull throne like Doom Entegasto had been erased, and he reminded me of his previous life as a financier. He had only joined us five days ago after wandering, but I could tell that he had completely adapted to the environment.</p>
<p>It appeared that he was on his way back from meeting the club members. It would have been an event to announce his return and solidify his position as the head of the shadow government.</p>
<p>He briefly exchanged glances with Yeon-Hee, then stood in front of me.</p>
<p>“Everything is fine?”</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han came in just in time. Judging by the way their eyes flickered at each other, it was obvious that they had resolved to enter outer space starting tomorrow, as Yeon-Hee had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>I finished explaining what I had already done to Yeon-Hee. Lee Tae-Han and Jonathan seemed relieved that what they had worried about hadn’t happened, but at the same time, they appeared to have gotten a better understanding of the transcendent beings.</p>
<p>Right when I was about to return to outer space, Jonathan called me. Unlike Yeon-Hee and Lee Tae-Han, his face was filled with tension. When he checked the text message on his phone, there was a creepy gleam in his eyes.</p>
<p>He stated, “I think you should know about this.”</p>
<p>Jonathan showed me his screen. The headlines of the news that would be published tomorrow were written in large letters on the screen.</p>
<p>[Who is John Doe of Jonathan Investment Finance Group?]</p>
<p>[(In-depth Exploration) The Most Super Rich of the Super Rich, Complete Monopoly of Wealth]</p>
<p>[The Second ‘Occupy Wall Street’ Might Happen…]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 400</p>
<p>The scene unfolding in front of Jonathan Investment Finance Group’s headquarters was reminiscent of the ‘Occupy Wall Street’ movement that took place eleven years ago. We agreed with the media’s assertion that the protest seemed to signal a resurgence of the movement.</p>
<p>At that time, the protest had spread worldwide. In the aftermath of the 2008 subprime crisis, many people criticized us as the Jonathan and Gillian Investment Finance Group were monopolizing the financial industry at the time.</p>
<p>However, no one had led the protest back then. Instead, it resembled a flashmob[1]. The decline was only a matter of time, and it ended up fading away and being forgotten.</p>
<p>“Is there someone behind this?”</p>
<p>I asked that first because Jonathan’s eyes were filled with tension.</p>
<p>He began to show me pictures. The first photograph was a young man who seemed to be a college student, carrying a backpack as if he intended to eat and sleep there. The picket he was holding said…</p>
<p>「I support Jonathan Investment Finance Group. However, they shouldn’t take everything.」</p>
<p>This one-man protest was the spark that caused the formation of the protestors in front of the New York headquarters. Then, Jonathan swiped to the picture of people gathering in support of him.</p>
<p>There was a specific part that Jonathan was wary about. He stopped flipping through the pictures and stopped at the last one. It was a picture of a small group of young college students talking to an elderly man.</p>
<p>“He is a professor who works as an academic advisor at ATTAC. His name is Clayton.”</p>
<p>Jonathan implied that he would have removed him immediately if he was in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>ATTAC sounded like the name of a boss monster, but in the global society, their significance was only at the level of minor monsters. Their actual name was Association for a Taxation of Financial Transactions in Assistance to the Citizens. Although they were originally founded in France, they could not be considered one of the leading organizations of the antiglobalization movement.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there was a reason why I said they were insignificant. Although they had presented various models of civil movements, their voices had been consistently ignored.</p>
<p>The antiglobalization activists had been stuck in their own world just like that. The problem now was that they were in an environment favorable for them to cause trouble. If I were an ordinary person, then I would have no choice but to listen to their voices.</p>
<p>The assets of Jonathan and Gillian Investment Finance Group alone accounted for 42.6 percent of the total global market capitalization. In USD, that was $ 19,132,512,000,000, which was approximately twenty trillion dollars. It was two quadrillion won in Korean currency.</p>
<p>The public wasn’t stupid. They knew that this figure was only limited to stocks just by glancing at it. Even they could easily say that the wealth was being unfairly distributed throughout the world.</p>
<p>As could be seen in the pictures, the current number of protestors was small, around sixty people. However, it was clear that once the wind blew, their numbers would grow enough to fill the entire Wall Street. On top of that, if they organized leadership…</p>
<p>If they focused on one or two specific goals instead of making a fuss about multiple issues, then the public’s voice wouldn’t fade away like they did in the past.</p>
<p>I said as I pointed at the professor in the picture, “He seems to be volunteering to be the leader. He must have learned something from the past, and that is probably why he came faster than anyone else.”</p>
<p>Jonathan replied, suppressing his anger, “Yes, he is gathering his colleagues. Activists from ATTAC will step up as leaders after removing their political stances.”</p>
<p>He lingered on the professor in the picture similar to how Doom Entegasto gazed at me.</p>
<p>He said, “You get it, right? This protest will spread soon, Sun.”</p>
<p>Despite his attempts to suppress the media’s movement, they began reporting on us. Prior to the U.S. President joining our club, we had been constantly criticizing the media and dismissing them as “fake news,” leaving them in a tight spot. However, they had now reached their limit and could no longer ignore the issues that were being discussed and debated on the Internet.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Clayton was facing a famous documentary director at a cafe on Wall Street. The camera was set up in a position where it could capture the side profiles of the two of them and the scenery outside the window. Through the window, the crowd that had previously numbered fewer than one hundred had now grown to more than that. The people waving their picket signs towards the camera were also spotted.</p>
<p>The so-called ‘top 0.1 percent,’ consisting of the super-rich, have been controlling two-thirds of the world’s entire GDP. However, since the Stage of Advent, the gap between the super-rich has widened significantly, and within the 0.1% of the super-rich, a 0.0001% class has been formed. Today, a group of protestors have gathered in front of the headquarters of Jonathan Investment Finance Group. I am here with one of the protestors to talk about their goals.</p>
<p>The director finished preparing for the shoot after thinking of the narration for the clip. The professor and director had just exchanged brief greetings.</p>
<p>The professor said, “The gap between the super-rich and the general public is large, but the gap between the super-rich and the small number of financial rulers is even larger. In fact, calling them ‘rulers’ is not a stretch.”</p>
<p>The director was confident that Clayton’s opinion matched the intended direction of the documentary clip. He suddenly thought of a caption to add to the film.</p>
<p>Were the new absolute monarchs born on the Day of Advent?</p>
<p>“Imagine a world where people’s heights are determined by their wealth. Then, I’d be looking up at you, Director.”</p>
<p>The director didn’t disagree with Clayton’s analogy.</p>
<p>“But don’t forget. This is Wall Street. Let’s say that you go out onto the street. The first things you notice are giants striding along, meters tall. They are Wall Street’s managers. They are so tall that everyone’s eyes are fixed on them. Then, when you notice a commotion at your feet and look down, you finally discover dwarves like me bustling about.”</p>
<p>The director nodded, amused by the thought.</p>
<p>“There are people so tiny that we can’t even see them with naked eyes on the street as well. Let’s say you turn your head at a loud noise. It is so loud that you would have thought mountains were moving, but it is a giant, towering more than two miles high.”</p>
<p>The director interjected, “The super-rich.”</p>
<p>Clayton nodded. “That’s right. You have no choice but to flee from the possibility of being crushed by its foot. But then you wondered why the world is always ‘night.’ You then remember legends of a ‘sun’ that used to rise and light up the day. So you ask the giants, ‘Can you see the sun up there?’”</p>
<p>“Can they see the sun up there?” asked the director.</p>
<p>“Haha, yes. Like that. Your question was delivered through the mouths of giants. From small giants to medium, to big giants, then to mountainous giants.”</p>
<p>Clayton continued while shaking his head.</p>
<p>“But you receive an answer that none of the giants in the world can see the sun. That’s when you reach a conclusion. Could there be a king of giants, so massive that his shadow alone covers the entire world? And at the same time, you tremble in fear. If such a colossal giant exists, the mere act of lifting his foot could be directly connected to countless fates. A single step could split a country.”</p>
<p>The director waited for the professor to continue.</p>
<p>“Although it is just a hypothetical world that you just made, the reality is not much different.”</p>
<p>Clayton pointed to the protestors outside the window, and the director’s gaze followed.</p>
<p>“Those people gathered there have the same fear as you did in the story. Do they appear as rebels who defy the system? No. They are ordinary people who have realized that their fate, along with the entire nation, is being determined by the biggest giant.”</p>
<p>“You mean Jonathan and Gillian Investment Finance Group.”</p>
<p>“There is one more. John Doe.”</p>
<p>The director thought he would have to change the motto. He planned to make a one-minute short animation about the story the professor had told him about and named the nation ‘Titan.’ He also thought about the king of that country.</p>
<p>Do you know the King of Titan, John Doe?</p>
<p>Yes, this is it.</p>
<p>A satisfied smile bloomed over the director’s face. The interview continued.</p>
<p>“We must have one voice. There are many issues, but we need to focus on matters that can cover as many issues as possible.”</p>
<p>“And you think that the key to resolving this is John Doe, right?”</p>
<p>“His wealth not only exceeds that of Jonathan Hunter, but the fact that he has never made a public appearance also leads me to believe that he may be at the helm of the financial elite. In addition, the fact that his identity is still veiled, means that he wields lawless financial power more than Jonathan Hunter.”</p>
<p>The director sent a signal to the cameraman as he finished the interview. He meant to zoom in on the professor’s picket sign, which was leaning against the table.</p>
<p>「It is not Jonathan Hunter. Why is the government so eager to hide John Doe’s identity?」</p>
<p>The camera didn’t even miss the back of Professor Clayton as he picked up the picket sign and walked out into the street.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jonathan boarded the association’s private jet stationed at Gunsan Airport after sending Seon-Hu to outer space. It was time for him to return to New York.</p>
<p>The situation on Wall Street, where the number of protestors was growing, was constantly being updated on his phone through messages. The increasing number of protestors and their slogans becoming more unified into one voice made him uneasy.</p>
<p>John Doe. John Doe. John Doe!</p>
<p>He was frowning.</p>
<p>Bad things were emanating from Wall Street and spreading outward. There was no need to cause a military uproar. The contagious disease would be crushed by the flames of the ‘Descent of the King of Hell.’ It was worse as it occurred during wartime.</p>
<p>However, burning them with force would be a violation of the order Seon-Hu had kept.</p>
<p>Jonathan muttered as he recalled Seon-Hu recently leaving for outer space.</p>
<p>“No matter what kind of dirt is thrown at us, I will deal with it myself.”</p>
<p>As he could tell how the protest would end, he was ready for it.</p>
<p>1. A phenomenon where groups of people come together in a public space to perform a seemingly spontaneous and coordinated action, often for entertainment or social purposes. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 401</p>
<p>“Why John Doe? Because he is a symbol of capitalism along with Jonathan Hunter. I want to talk about how the government has modified over thirty-four laws just to hide John Doe.”</p>
<p>Every time he switched channels, various voices came out.</p>
<p>Why now…</p>
<p>The President of the United States frowned with discomfort.</p>
<p>“If you don’t take any action, the worst-case scenario will become a reality. We are 99.9999%! The probability that you are with us is 99.9999% as well!”</p>
<p>“The government only gives us numbers, and just looking at those numbers makes us think that our economy is actually growing. However, why is it not the case for those around me? My family and neighbors are still suffering in all aspects, such as jobs and taxes. It is so hard to see them in pain. Hasn’t our world become better by repelling alien invasions?”</p>
<p>“People think that our system avoided collapse because of ‘Stage of Advent Defenders’ like Jonathan and Gillian Investment Finance Group, but they have only indulged in greed as they have always done. They monopolized information and made investments so that they wouldn’t lose anything. There is evidence everywhere that they knew about the alien invasion in advance and prepared alternatives before the Day of Advent. They didn’t defend the Day of Advent. They took advantage of it.”</p>
<p>“What many people are not aware of is that the New York Stock Exchange is not a national institution. It is owned by Jonathan Investment Finance Group, so who would own the Federal Reserve Bank? Why do you think the board members of the Federal Reserve Bank are filled with people from the Jonathan Group?”</p>
<p>“It’s not right. Protesting is our duty. Join us!”</p>
<p>“I guess I have to talk about numbers again. A society is deformed just by the top twenty percent of the rich occupying ninety percent of total wealth. But do you know this? Even among the top twenty percent, a few people like Jonathan Hunter and John Doe hold seventy percent of the wealth. The calculation is pretty simple. A few people hold more than sixty percent of the world’s total wealth. Just a few! Even a kid would know that this is wrong.”</p>
<p>“It was the Awakened who saved human civilization, not them. They were betting on humanity’s crisis!”</p>
<p>“There is something bigger. Look at how the World Awakened Association was integrated into the capitalist world. Why have they, who once crawled out of hell, become such obedient followers and only move by the rules of capital? The King of Hell. Jonathan Hunter. John Doe… They hold power beyond our imagination.”</p>
<p>“Police oppressed the public, and friends were arrested. I spent many nights awake on the streets. The reason I can tolerate this is that the future of our children depends on us.”</p>
<p>“If they acted as ‘Defenders of the Day of Advent’ for justice, now is the time to show a new justice. Bring justice to the world, Jonathan Hunter! Reveal yourselves, John Doe, and the leaders of Gillian Group! We are not your slaves!”</p>
<p>“The occupation will continue! Gather around, people! We will never be defeated! Always! Forever! We will definitely occupy Wall Street!”</p>
<p>“John Doe! John Doe! John Doe! Reveal yourself, John Doe!”</p>
<p>The louder the voices calling for John Doe grew, the more pressured the President of the United States felt. The protest wasn’t going to end within a day or two. His aides also stated that it would be much bigger and prolonged than the previous ones.</p>
<p>Unlike the past, which had been initially sparked by discontent with the government’s economic policies, this particular protest was triggered by the revelation of John Doe’s vast financial influence. The mere disclosure of the information instilled fear in the general public. They were overwhelmed with dread that they had to walk out on the streets, protesting.</p>
<p>In fact, there were signs. After the shock of the Day of Advent was settled, companies began to reveal their changed shareholder registries. When the total was tallied, 22.3 percent of the world’s total shares were in Jonathan Group alone, and the top ten groups combined held a staggering 62.1 percent.</p>
<p>If the scope was limited to the United States, then their control rate would have been much higher.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the world had found stability after the alien invasion, and the once-fearsome monsters were now mere contents to be consumed. The stories of how Awakened were making a fortune and living as luxuriously as royalty caused a sense of deprivation among the general public.</p>
<p>The tension had subsided, so the void was filled with fear and deprivation, fueled by anxiety. The Day of Advent, which could have led to the extinction of humanity, was soon forgotten by the public.</p>
<p>So why not!</p>
<p>However, his real concern was with the opportunists trying to take advantage of the situation and the fact that his core supporters, the farmers in the Farm Belt, were supporting the protestors.</p>
<p>He turned off the television, then picked up the newspaper on his desk, only to throw it on the floor in frustration.</p>
<p>「Jonathan Hunter and John Doe’s Financial Empire Even Reached the Farm Belt… Twenty-Two Confirmed Corporations.」</p>
<p>That was undoubtedly the work of the cunning Democratic Party.</p>
<p>Opportunistic bastards.f𝚛e𝚎𝙬𝑒𝚋𝚗𝚘ѵ𝐞𝒍. c𝐨𝙢</p>
<p>They had deliberately leaked the information that even the vast lands of the Farm Belt were under the Jonathan Group’s possession.</p>
<p>The off-year election was not far off. The economic indicators had been improving since China’s suppression, so he was looking forward to it. Moreover, new markets had opened up for the Awakened!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, if the situation persisted, he couldn’t dispel his anxiety about the possibility of losing both the House of Representatives and the Senate to the Democrats. If such an outcome were to occur, then the power of the presidency would be rendered meaningless. The club would look for a new alternative other than him.</p>
<p>As his worries deepened, someone knocked on the door. One of the opportunists came, right on time. The president quickly picked up the newspaper he had thrown and hid it in a drawer.</p>
<p>“I have been waiting for you, Mr. DeColes.”</p>
<p>The assemblyman was a fellow Republican who led a major faction in the House. He could be considered a comrade.</p>
<p>However, the president could sense that the meeting was going to be uncomfortable as the assemblyman had entered with an awkward expression.</p>
<p>In the end, the assemblyman’s lengthy statement was the same as others that the president needed to make a decision quickly to win in the upcoming election. And the decision was…</p>
<p>「Special Investigation Hearing Plan (John Doe)」</p>
<p>The document was thin. Nevertheless, when it was placed on the desk, it sounded like thunder to the president. Although he remained expressionless, he was screaming inside.</p>
<p>You will pass out once you realize his identity. How dare you!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was infuriating.</p>
<p>“You have to at least make a show of it, Mr. President. Who is John Doe?”</p>
<p>He grumbled, “I’d like to ask that myself. Isn't this the work of Obama and the rest of you?”</p>
<p>“...It’s unfortunate that we have come this far, but now is not the time to worry about Wall Street. You have done enough, Mr. President.”</p>
<p>The president burst out in anger, unable to contain his emotions any longer.</p>
<p>“You say it so easily! I cannot agree to this hearing! Never!”</p>
<p>The decision to hold or not hold the hearing rested with the Republican Party, which held the majority in the House. The president now realized that the party leaders had decided to proceed with the hearing.</p>
<p>Damn it.</p>
<p>The old lady who was once fully supported by the Democratic Party had lost not only to him but also the interest of the club. She was in a position to know the existence of the club, and a few high-ranking Republican officials were aware of it as well.</p>
<p>However, that was it. Those in a lower rank, who could only guess the presence of the club, were only focused on the upcoming election.</p>
<p>He vehemently insisted, “If the party turns their back on me, I will do the same, sir. Don’t forget that I can also put up a fight. I’m going to say this again, but I do not agree with the hearing. I have made my stance clear!”</p>
<p>“I will be back again, Mr. President. Please take a close look into the documents.”</p>
<p>The president called his chief aide over with a clear directive. He needed to select individuals who would align with him regardless of their political party.</p>
<p>The two moved to the chief aide’s office. They listed the names of House members on a large screen board and checked them one by one. Suddenly, the chief aide whispered, “...It is difficult right now to find supporters. What about asking for cooperation from the club members?”</p>
<p>It was an unwritten law. Unless the person was at the venue where the club conference was held, they shouldn’t have mentioned its name.</p>
<p>The U.S. President narrowed his eyes and shook his head.</p>
<p>If that happens, then they will be questioning my qualifications.</p>
<p>A strong impulse had hit him. He actually wanted to tell the club’s secrets to the chief aide and his position within the club as well. The club had such a vertical hierarchical structure. He had to consistently prove his qualifications to remain in the club even after the end of the presidential term.</p>
<p>The former president’s failure to do so had resulted in a miserable life after retirement.</p>
<p>I can’t believe he is into extreme sports at that age. That must be the only way to suppress his desires.</p>
<p>The president didn’t want to experience the same fate as the former president.</p>
<p>He suddenly said, “Let my wife know that I won’t be able to come home for a few days.”</p>
<p>That night, the U.S. President was nervously biting his dry lips. He reviewed the hearing plan while threatening and convincing House members, and he found that some parts were excessively detailed, contrary to the claim that he had to at least put on a show.</p>
<p>The hearing wasn’t just about the scale of John Doe’s assets. It was a place he would be questioned about his past when he had accumulated such wealth and the detailed process of protecting the world on the Day of Advent. Employees of the Jonathan Group were scheduled to take the witness stand.</p>
<p>These crazy motherfuckers. Are they trying to blow up the entire world?</p>
<p>Many people wanted to raise their value through this opportunity without realizing exactly whose pocket their election expenses had come from…</p>
<p>The president shifted his gaze toward the whiteboard. He was still five seats short of stopping the hearing, but he had finally reached a point where he could catch up.</p>
<p>Wait…were the windows open before?</p>
<p>A gust of wind blew from behind. Ever since the chief aide and his team had started running around, the president was alone in the office. It was supposed to be empty, except for him.</p>
<p>Yet, he felt a heavy presence from his back along with the wind’s intrusion. His heart quivered. He didn’t know how they passed the security, but there was no doubt that a group of unregistered Awakened had come together. If not that, then the club might have sent killers.</p>
<p>Frightening thoughts crossed his mind. Since he was well aware of his failure to get rid of the protest and the hearing, he moved quite slowly to check behind him.</p>
<p>However, there was only one person. The force emanating from that person was so powerful that the president had originally thought there was a group of Awakened intruders.</p>
<p>After he recognized the Awakened’s face, he hurriedly lowered his head with widened eyes. Although it wasn’t actually him, he needed to treat him as if he was John Doe as this guy was entrusted with full authority.</p>
<p>“...The King of Hell…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 402</p>
<p>When the cold gaze of the King of Hell shifted towards the whiteboard, the team from the association’s Security Bureau, which had been sent for the safety of the White House, took action. There were Awakened employed in the security team, but most of them were low-level Bsilgols.</p>
<p>However, the one in charge of the team sent from the Security Bureau was an Awakened in the master section. He was ranked 1295th in the world, and his codename was YuShi[1].</p>
<p>Recalling that the individual had been directly under the King of Hell in the Final Stage, the U.S. President took a step back to allow them time to catch up. They seemed to have a strong sense of camaraderie with each other.</p>
<p>The president had heard that when most of the Awakened in the Final Stage was trying to assassinate John Doe’s lover, Mary, the King of Hell and his corps continued focusing on fighting against alien monsters. A hierarchy was clear, but there was a certain sense formed at the end of the Final Stage between the two.</p>
<p>He would do whatever the King of Hell orders him to do. Even if that order is to overthrow this country…</p>
<p>This didn’t only apply between the King of Hell and an Awakened standing in front of him. Even without such a bond, the Awakened were in a state of submission to John Doe’s power. A single word, like ‘kill,’ was enough for them to move.</p>
<p>From then on, the absolute monarchy hidden behind the veil would truly rule the world. For instance, the rapidly spreading protests and the political situation filled with opportunists would be governed by John Doe alone.</p>
<p>Therefore, the president couldn’t stop himself from making assumptions.</p>
<p>What if his patience has run out? What if he has decided to reorganize the world?</p>
<p>He wondered if there would be a spot for him to stand if such a world began.</p>
<p>Would there be a chance for club members who are not Awakened..?</p>
<p>It was a miserable thought because the best scenario for him was to maintain the current situation. It was the same for the media attacking him and the politicians in power.</p>
<p>The president continued to think while standing in front of the King of Hell and Awakened from the Security Bureau.</p>
<p>Life is about survival, and the most important thing everywhere is survival.</p>
<p>If he planned to suppress the protest with physical force and establish a unified absolute monarchy from that point on, then the president thought he needed to clarify his direction.</p>
<p>He thought of his school days and the moments at the fucking New York Military Academy. Although it wasn’t a national educational institution that made him be commissioned as a general upon graduation, it was more brutal than the military.</p>
<p>He had to wear a neatly arranged uniform and a shiny belt buckle. Since it was where the troublemakers of wealthy families were attending, he always had to be number one in order to survive. Even if he lacked confidence, he needed to fake it and seem confident. Once he made a decision, he had to stick to it until the end, even if he realized later that it was the wrong decision, and not expose any weaknesses.</p>
<p>That was the most important rule of survival. The U.S. President made up his mind. Of course, he didn’t want to oppress his citizens. After all, it was because of the support of the beloved public that he could enter the White House despite the club’s attempts.</p>
<p>However, if someone asked whether he would stay on the public’s side or remain a member of the club, he would answer without hesitation. In his mind, the scene of armed soldiers clashing with protestors unfolded.</p>
<p>After the Awakened from the Security Bureau left, he immediately said, “I will declare martial law.”</p>
<p>He had already planned whom to appoint as the martial law commander, devised a strategy to apprehend opposing governors, and created a plan to suppress the voices of the Congress members who would call for the lifting of martial law.</p>
<p>It would be a challenging process, but he needed to succeed.</p>
<p>However, the King of Hell didn’t reply. Instead, he was staring at the names written on the whiteboard, including those belonging to the party that hosted the hearing, with a cold gaze.</p>
<p>The president was certain that what he felt was not wrong. John Doe and his aides were pissed enough to overturn the order they had created.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the King of Hell’s answer was different from the look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Martial law for such a trivial matter? That will be perfect for paralyzing the government.”</p>
<p>It was not trivial. Pro-revolution groups were emerging across the country, from Wall Street to major cities, and the movement was spreading across the world.</p>
<p>The King of Hell picked up the hearing plan document while ignoring the dumbfounded president. He crossed out some phrases with a pen and added a few words.</p>
<p>The president took it back and read through it again.</p>
<p>「Special Investigation Hearing Plan (John Doe) (Jonathan Hunter)</p>
<p>Hearing Subject: John Doe Jonathan Hunter</p>
<p>Purpose: To conduct a thorough investigation, it is proposed that the subject be summoned to attend a hearing where they will be required to answer questions. Additionally, if deemed necessary, the subject may be required to listen to testimonies and statements from witnesses…」</p>
<p>“Both sides will come to an agreement with this. You should not create any more enemies.”</p>
<p>The president couldn’t think of what to say in response.</p>
<p>“But you did your best. I will remember that.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the President of the United States was left alone again in the chief aide’s office, he was confused about what his true feelings were. Mixed feelings of relief and regret overwhelmed him. Perhaps it was because the decision to proceed with the hearing had lifted some of the burden from his shoulders, but at the same time, he felt completely drained. Fatigue began to rush in.</p>
<p>He didn’t stop by his private residence, but instead returned to the White House.</p>
<p>“But you did your best. I will remember that.”</p>
<p>That was the last remake left by John Doe’s agent. He weakly brushed his face with one hand, then a bitter smile spread across his face.</p>
<p>Is this what he meant? In such a crappy situation…</p>
<p>He realized that he wouldn’t be able to sleep tonight and pulled out the Bible that was on one side of the desk. It wasn’t the one used by President Abraham Lincoln when he entered the White House, but the contents were the same.</p>
<p>Exodus 21:23 - 25.</p>
<p>But if there is serious injury, you are to take life for life, eye for an eye, tooth for tooth, hand for hand, foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise.</p>
<p>That was his favorite verse. When he quoted this verse during the election campaign and argued against admitting Muslim terrorists into the country, he often faced people counter-attacking him with Matthew 5:39: ‘But I tell you, do not resist an evil person. If anyone slaps you on the right cheek, turn them to the other cheek also.’</p>
<p>That was why. He had a strong desire to reveal today’s story to the opportunists who attacked him in the past and the pastors who still claimed ‘John Doe’ as the Messiah. John Doe was having the agent voluntarily attend the hearing. That was no different from the words of Matthew 5:39.</p>
<p>Moreover, most religions wanted to be recognized for the legitimacy of their denominations in his name these days. His wealth, power, and even faith formed a trinity…</p>
<p>At that moment, he suddenly realized that his line of thinking had gone down an absurd path.</p>
<p>‘What the hell am I thinking?’</p>
<p>He shuddered as he imagined a world where all of humanity had become fanatics, staring only at him. Such a world was worse than an absolute regime that trampled the public under martial law. Also, the current regime was much better than absolute domination.</p>
<p>The next morning, the President of the United States called in Congressman DeColes. The protest had spread to Japan, France, and John Doe’s motherland, South Korea.</p>
<p>As the hotline call with the South Korean President was ending, DeColes entered the room. He couldn’t hide his combative spirit because many of those who had promoted the hearing with him had turned to the president’s side.</p>
<p>“Mr. President. Are you sure you want to do this? Are you serious?”</p>
<p>The member of the House replaced his usual morning greetings with an outburst.</p>
<p>“This is a national issue beyond the party, sir.”</p>
<p>“You cannot lead the country alone. I hate to mention it again, but you should support the decision that our party made…”</p>
<p>“Well, then we don’t need this. Shall we put it to a vote?”</p>
<p>He didn’t mean it. The president handed over the hearing plan with a cranky face. DeColes’s eyes narrowed.</p>
<p>“Jonathan Hunter?”</p>
<p>The president pointed at the hearing plan documents with his chin and answered, “Let’s come to an agreement on that. If we still lose the election after all this, then…”</p>
<p>“Have you talked about this with the Jonathan Investment Finance Group?” asked DeColes.</p>
<p>“Don’t just think about the off-year election. You should look forward to the 2020 re-election as well. Who will fund the elections if we blindly turn our backs on Wall Street? You should think more wisely. If we lose voters, we gather new ones. If we don’t have financial sponsors, we look for new ones as well.”</p>
<p>“Wait, Mr. President. Did Jonathan Hunter say he would appear in court?”</p>
<p>“If he refuses, then you can enforce it, Mr. DeColes.”</p>
<p>The president enjoyed DeColes’s bewildered expression before continuing.</p>
<p>“I’m kidding. I did have a conversation with Jonathan Group.”</p>
<p>DeColes blinked. “That is…”</p>
<p>“You think we’re lucky, right? It will be fine. You should all be grateful to have a president like me.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t understand your deep intentions, Mr. President. I apologize on behalf of us.”</p>
<p>“Words mean nothing. You should apologize in the future with different means. Don’t forget that I saved you all.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It became quiet all of a sudden. The performance artists preparing a show in front of Wall Street’s Charging Bull, the protestors and police arresting them for crossing the line, the professors from the academic advisory board of ATTAC who referred to the protesting site as the ‘perfect classroom,’ and even the pedestrians carrying donated food and necessities on carts became silent.</p>
<p>As they looked up at the illegally installed large monitor, the noisy streets seemed to have stopped in time.</p>
<p>[Breaking News: House Special Investigation Hearing Settled… A Special Hearing on ‘Jonathan Hunter’ Regarding Financial Defense on the Day of Advent. Attendance Notification Sent.]</p>
<p>Cheers of victory pierced the sky at once.</p>
<p>“What if Jonathan Hunter refuses to attend?”</p>
<p>Despite someone raising a question, it was quickly drowned out by the sound of cheers. However, as the excitement died down, the question began to surface.</p>
<p>People became anxious. Their voice had reached the White House, and even politicians who were closely tied to Wall Street had joined them and were speaking in unison. Nonetheless, Jonathan Hunter, an Awakened and a member of the association, had the right to refuse attendance based on the agreement between the World Awakened Association and the UN member states.</p>
<p>Besides those rights, Jonathan Hunter ranked fourth in power among the Awakened. If he firmly refused to attend, then how could the hearing proceed?</p>
<p>The once-loud cheers evolved into new chants.</p>
<p>“Jonathan should attend!”</p>
<p>“Jonathan should attend!”</p>
<p>A few hours later, the large monitor that had been playing the professors’ lectures switched to a different scene. Beneath the excited announcer’s face, the protestors discovered something that aligned with their demands.</p>
<p>Waaaaaaaah-!</p>
<p>Everyone hugged each other, and some of them even started crying in happiness.</p>
<p>[Breaking News: Jonathan Hunter, “I will attend.”]</p>
<p>The protestors on the streets thought they had won as they looked at the screen.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated day had finally arrived, and it began with the rising sun capturing the world’s attention.</p>
<p>1. ‘A God of Rain’ in Chinese. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 403</p>
<p>The first time Jonathan and Kim Cheong-Soo met in person was in the waiting room of the assembly as they had only talked through phone calls prior to that. Kim Cheong-Soo also received a notice to attend the hearing. Although he was just a witness, he knew he was one of the subjects of the hearing as well.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it wasn’t just the hearing that made him furious as he was pissed about what was happening outside the assembly.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo skipped the greeting and dove into the point immediately. It was an urgent matter he had heard on his way to the assembly as well.</p>
<p>“The search warrant review has begun.”</p>
<p>There was a face of a young prosecutor on the smartphone that Kim Cheong-Soo showed to Jonathan.</p>
<p>“The submitter is an underlying prosecutor, but many members of the House and civic groups are involved. It has been confirmed that he is carrying this out without the approval of the current chief prosecutor.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo did not take out a separate profile for the prosecutor because the profiles of candidates running for chief prosecutor were readily accessible through the election management website or the candidate’s campaign website for the upcoming off-year election.</p>
<p>At that moment, a dry, lifeless chuckle burst out from Jonathan’s mouth. Despite this, his clenched fists looked as if he was about to cause trouble at any moment. In fact, the armrest of his chair had shattered into pieces, and the entire chair broke as he got up.</p>
<p>Looking into Jonathan’s outraged eyes, Kim Cheong-Soo realized what the presence of ‘the King of Hell’ meant to people in the Stage of Advent. It wasn’t something that could be hidden even if Jonathan wore a suit instead of items.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo pulled himself together and continued speaking, “It will be dismissed for now.”</p>
<p>Jonathan commented, “I guess they are going to talk about Anti-Trust law.”</p>
<p>The Anti-Trust Law was a policy that had dismantled the kingdom of Rockefeller, who was once called the King of Oil.</p>
<p>However, Kim Cheong-Soo couldn’t hear what Jonathan said. He only sensed a high-pitched noise that caused extreme pain in his eardrums. He couldn’t hear anything other than a low hum.</p>
<p>Jonathan noticed that his anger had gone too far when he saw Kim Cheong-Soo covering his ears and complaining of pain. He needed to calm down, but it was easier said than done.</p>
<p>When Jonathan apologized, Kim Cheong-Soo shook his hands as if to say it was alright.</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>Jonathan responded, “Anti-Trust Law.”</p>
<p>When Kim Cheong-Soo nodded, Jonathan’s heart pounded with the impulse to activate the Descent of the King of Hell.</p>
<p>He was more vexed now compared to when he had found out that Rothschild was trying to kill Sun’s parents. Rothschild’s ambition was at least blatant. However, those who were joining the protests… The stupid idiots who knew nothing about the world were trying to cover up their greed as justice. Jonathan was on the verge of exploding in anger.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he needed to suppress his emotions. He could cause chaos in the world, but this wasn’t the world he created. He was just following Sun’s rules.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo waited for Jonathan to calm down, then spoke.</p>
<p>“Many of the politicians in the assembly haven’t even seen the shadow of the club. The attacks will become more intense. Keep an eye on this guy. He is the one leading the search warrant along with the prosecutor.”</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>「Mr. Jonathan Hunter.」</p>
<p>Reporters were swarmed like bees at the central seat where nameplates were placed and the entrance leading to it. Even after Jonathan sat down, the sound of reporters pressing camera shutters didn’t stop. They were close enough such that they could reach out their hands and touch him.</p>
<p>For a while, Jonathan couldn’t see the assembly members sitting in a circle as they were obscured by the reporters.</p>
<p>Jonathan maintained a stern face. He tapped the microphone to signal that he was ready. As the reporters cleared the way, the hearing began after the formal greetings from the chairman.</p>
<p>「DeColes Donovan, Republican House Representative」</p>
<p>The first member to speak was chosen, but he couldn’t even open his mouth. As his gaze met Jonathan’s, he realized what kind of trouble the government had caused.</p>
<p>Jonathan was basically the owner of Wall Street and exercised tremendous financial control. Even excluding the power he wielded in the Stage of Advent, he exuded an overwhelming presence that dominated the entire assembly.</p>
<p>Of course, he looked mad about the current situation. When an assemblyman noticed that the cameras were turned on for broadcasting, he was about to open his mouth. However, another member snatched the chance to speak first.</p>
<p>“Are you using a smartphone? Then, which company’s are you using?”</p>
<p>Jonathan tersely responded, “Berry.”</p>
<p>“Same with me. I have heard that you came here by car. Is it a German brand’s car?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“When did you sleep last night, and where did you have breakfast this morning?”</p>
<p>Jonathan replied, “I understand what you are trying to get at, so stop. Yes, I own all the stocks of the companies that I use.</p>
<p>“If you only possessed them, we wouldn’t be gathered here today. Even if it is a story that only applies to you, Mr. Hunter. Many Americans are concerned about the monopolistic economic structure caused by the Jonathan Investment Finance Group, as it could have a negative impact on society as a whole. Today, we are here to talk about that.”</p>
<p>Jonathan checked the face of the man who spoke.</p>
<p>「Jack Benedict, Democratic House Representative」</p>
<p>The name on the nameplate matched the one Kim Cheong-Soo had mentioned earlier.</p>
<p>Then, the politician who had initially missed the chance to speak, tapped the microphone causing it to ring, while giving Jack an uncomfortable glance, as he had seized the opportunity to speak.</p>
<p>This is different from what we agreed on beforehand. Why are you using words that provoke the public, such as monopolistic economic structure? You will end up being boring if you keep trying to stand out alone, Mr. Benedict.</p>
<p>“We want to hear directly from you about the financial defense that took place on the Day of Advent. We appreciate that you have joined us here today. So let me ask you. Do you remember the Day of Advent? You spent many years in the Stage of Advent, did you not?” asked Jack Benedict</p>
<p>Jonathan said, “No one will be able to forget that day.”</p>
<p>“Then, do you remember where you were on that day?”</p>
<p>“I was at the headquarters.”</p>
<p>“Did you direct the group yourself?” questioned Jack Benedict.</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>“One of the points that many people are curious about is that Jonathan Group made trades that defied common sense on that day. While most capitalists were disposing of their assets, the Jonathan Group actively purchased those that had appeared on the market. Wasn’t it because you knew in advance that extraterrestrial civilization would be repelled in the future?”</p>
<p>Jonathan retorted, “Let me be clear. We had no clue whether they would be repulsed or not. Instead, we suspected there would be an invasion.”</p>
<p>“How did you know that?” asked John Benedict.</p>
<p>“I can explain by using two keywords. Pre-Awakened and trait Explorer. As you know, Osiris, Joshua von Karjan, is the head of the Karjan Group, a member of the association. He was also a pre-Awakened at the same time. The trait Explorer predicts the moment a gate opens. Let me repeat this again. We knew there would be an invasion, but no one knew if they would be repelled.”</p>
<p>“Did you inform the government?”</p>
<p>Jonathan nodded. “Of course. Not only the United States but also the leaders of the world governments were aware of this either directly or indirectly. Therefore, governments all over the world were able to safely shelter their people on the Day of Advent.”</p>
<p>John Benedict aggressively continued, “Then, I have a question. Why did you aggressively buy stocks with group assets when you weren’t certain that the aliens would be repulsed?”</p>
<p>“When we make a decision, it’s not based on a single reason, especially in the financial world. However, we acted based on only one reason on that day.”</p>
<p>Jonathan gritted his teeth, and hot breath fluttered in his nostrils.</p>
<p>“It was to defend the collapsing economic system. The foundation of civilization.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Another politician took the floor.</p>
<p>「Sarah Weston, Democratic Senator」</p>
<p>“You succeeded in defending humanity, and we are all grateful for your work. But is it true that you guys really didn’t know the possibility that the aliens would be defeated?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That’s strange. Joshua von Karjan, the head of Karjan Group, stated that the Awakened would emerge with their prepared power and ability on the Stage of Advent providing us with a relief from new threats.”</p>
<p>Jonathan countered, “Then, do you remember what he said next? We were short on time back then. Let’s backtrack a bit. The Stage of Advent occurred a week after the Day of Advent. During that week, the monsters emerging from the gate were susceptible to our firepower. However, the ones that appeared an hour before the Stage of Advent were of a higher rank.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“He only meant that humanity should not use nuclear weapons because we would be back after the Stage of Advent. If he didn’t have the press conference, then the world would have been destroyed by nuclear weapons before the Awakened even got a chance to fight.”</p>
<p>Sarah then said, “You mentioned that Jonathan Group did warn the governments over the world about the Day of Advent, either directly or indirectly.”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Then, why didn’t you inform the public and private market participants? The reason this is important is because there are many misunderstandings about this. People believe that Jonathan Investment Finance Group monopolized information that was directly related to the fate of humanity and profited from it. If the public had known about it, then they would have been prepared. Many Americans who disposed of their property that day are suffering from resulting damage.”</p>
<p>Jonathan rubbed the tip of his nose. Then, he answered while pressing his thigh under the table with his fists, “I know there are people who can’t stand the results now. I understand their feelings, too… However, it’s their misunderstanding that we profited from monopolizing the information.”</p>
<p>The woman looked skeptical. “Okay.”</p>
<p>“I won’t repeat that we prepared countermeasures with governments instead of monopolizing the information. It’s the government’s duty to answer the question of why they didn’t publicize the Day of Advent.”</p>
<p>“If you say so…” she interjected.</p>
<p>Jonathan admonished her, “Don’t interrupt me, ma’am.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“The world stock market was divided into two stands on the Day of Advent. The ‘buy’ side and the ‘sell’ side. The majority was on the ‘sell’ side, and those on ‘buy’ were the so-called ‘Defenders of the Day of Advent.’”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“In other words, the ‘sell’ side believed that the public’s fear would subside, while ‘buy’ anticipated a market crash due to the public’s terror. However, there is something you are all forgetting. Even while we were successfully wiping out the monsters with our firepower, the public’s fear was still at its peak.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“The most confusing moment during the Stage of Advent was Act One, Stage One. Despite our announcement that anyone could be placed in the Stage of Advent, no one was truly prepared. Have I provided a sufficient answer to your question? Do not assume that people would have been prepared if we had publicized it. If you make such claims, then the public will believe your misleading information.”</p>
<p>The transition of the speaker’s turn was rather awkward as Jack Benedict, a Democratic House Representative, seized the microphone right after Jonathan had finished his response. This caused a brief disturbance, after which the chairman reluctantly allowed Jack to speak.</p>
<p>「Jack Benedict, Democratic House Representative」</p>
<p>The camera captured him and his nameplate on the screen again.</p>
<p>“It is hard to confirm the accuracy of your statement immediately as the information you disclosed is considered confidential. The truth will be revealed in twenty years, so let’s focus on the present. There have been significant changes in the global economy since the Day of Advent, and Jonathan Investment Finance Group has their influence everywhere. They have taken control of the majority of companies and led the shareholders' meetings. Corporate executives have no choice but to look to their guidance.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“The decision of the Jonathan Investment Finance Group affects us immediately. We witness their influence across all sectors, not just one market. I call this ‘monopoly.’ Yes, there is a legal term for that.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict turned toward the camera and raised his voice, narrowing his eyes, “The Anti-Trust Act. The Monopoly Prohibition Act. As Mr. Hunter has mentioned earlier, we should not discuss unconfirmed matters and present personal opinions as if they are facts.”</p>
<p>The chairman tried to hurriedly dismiss the matter, but Jack Benedict continued to speak.</p>
<p>“I’m saying that we should figure that out from now on. It will be an opportunity for the Jonathan Investment Finance Group to prove they are not above the law. However, if they have violated the Monopoly Prohibition Act, then they should be dismantled to protect the free competition of the market economy.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict made a big gesture as he was conscious about the camera filming him.</p>
<p>“The voices of our great American citizens are not limited to the defense process on the Day of Advent. There are bigger voices. We should start by examining whether the Jonathan Investment Finance Group is currently violating the Monopoly Act. We should check if they are abusing their power based on their control or not, and if they are working to acquire more monopoly power than they currently have.”</p>
<p>The members of the assembly, attendees, and reporters began to stir up.</p>
<p>At that moment, Jonathan closed his eyes. He was comforting himself inwardly to suppress his anger and muscles that were on the verge of exploding.</p>
<p>Was it because he had spent decades being a ruler on the Stage of Advent? No. It was because Sun’s sublime achievements that he had spent years on were being ridiculed by the tongue of an opportunist. Also, when he thought about how the public would hold this jackal up as a hero…</p>
<p>“Mr. Chairman, members of the assembly, and dear great American citizens, I propose a recess for this hearing. The search warrant review for the Jonathan Investment Finance Group is currently underway. Irrespective of the result, it is imperative that the assembly forms a ‘Special Investigation Committee on the Monopoly of the Jonathan Investment Finance Group’ and initiates a thorough inquiry without specifying any financial constraints or time limit.”</p>
<p>Jonathan’s brows twitched.</p>
<p>Bang-!</p>
<p>A translucent blue giant burst in through the wall of the assembly. The female Awakened who had summoned it was so furious that she was shedding tears.</p>
<p>“How can you tolerate such an insult?!”</p>
<p>Before she finished speaking, Jack Benedict was already screaming in the grip of the blue giant. However, it was safe to say the cry of the female Awakened, Olivia, sounded more like a scream as well.</p>
<p>“I ruined it. This unworthy servant has destroyed the master’s hard work. Don’t…don’t forgive me! I can’t stand this!”</p>
<p>Olivia jumped into the air and screamed even louder, “Dieeeeee! Jin!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 404</p>
<p>Olivia’s command was executed immediately. The reverberating cries of Jack Benedict had abruptly come to an end, leaving him lifeless and limp while still in the grip of the blue giant. The dead man resembled a marionette whose cords had been cut. The giant had crushed him to death with brute force, then turned to find its next prey. It emitted a powerful light like a searchlight in the car that brightened the darkness.</p>
<p>The incident had stopped everything. A female politician who was sitting beside Jack remained motionless, barely blinking, even as his body was violently thrown onto her desk. She stiffened with fear, and the blue giant slammed its fist on her.</p>
<p>Crack!</p>
<p>When the giant pulled its wrist back, a bloody unrecognizable mass was left behind, stuck to the floor.</p>
<p>Then, people started running away in panic as if time had suddenly begun to flow again.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaah-!</p>
<p>Olivia was killing them, and the blue light emanating from the giant’s eyes sliced everything it touched. The only untouched area was the seat where Jonathan was sitting. Although chaos took place around him, he was staring at the dead body of Jack, the giant’s first target.</p>
<p>He then gritted his teeth and yelled at Olivia, “Do you think this is helping me? Sun would have warned you!”</p>
<p>Olivia turned her astonished, blood-covered face towards him.</p>
<p>“How did you figure that out? Already…”</p>
<p>Olivia’s expression quickly changed. Then, Jonathan stood up.</p>
<p>“The Olivia I know is not that stupid.”</p>
<p>She responded, “I hope your anger settles down a bit.”</p>
<p>“But you did that for your own motives,” Jonathan replied sharply.</p>
<p>“If I’m still pissed…then should we change the scene?” she asked.</p>
<p>He huffed, “What difference does it make? This is all an illusion.”</p>
<p>She smiled wryly. “Yeah, you broke it too fast. I must have gotten rusty from just lying in bed. But don’t you feel better? You looked terrifying earlier, man.”</p>
<p>He responded sarcastically, “Wow. I’m honored that you even cared about how I felt. Do you want me to compliment you?”</p>
<p>“Jonathan, you are…you looked like you would do something terrible. Can you honestly say no? Then how about this? I will make sure the politicians fucking shut their traps.”</p>
<p>“I warn you, never cross the line ever again. Even if it’s you…” Jonathan swallowed the rest of what he was about to blurt out. “This is my business, Mary. Get out of my head. Right now.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As soon as Jonathan blinked, his surroundings reverted to their original state. The filthy corpses that had been scattered around him were now resurrected.</p>
<p>“That is what people want, and the justice of this era.”</p>
<p>Jonathan looked away from Jack Benedict, who was chastising him, and turned his head to the left. The reporters were buzzing there.</p>
<p>He wondered when he had been exposed to Mary’s influence. Could it have been when the reporters crowded around his desk at the start of the hearing? He suspected that one of the reporters he had locked eyes with was Mary. Despite being aware of her presence, he couldn’t identify her specifically.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, his anger toward the assemblymen had somehow subsided. Although it was an illusion, it worked because it was the scene he wanted to see. He was mad at Mary, but he conceded that if she had not intervened, his fury would have found a way to surface. It could have been expressed subtly, but still perceptible on his face as a display of power.</p>
<p>That wouldn’t have made the situation better. The hearing was a place to ease the public’s minds, not to fuel their anger further.</p>
<p>His furrowed brows relaxed, and he spoke to the buzzing stage.</p>
<p>“If you want a break…I am also willing to accommodate that.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jonathan returned to the waiting room and recalled Mary’s suggestion. However, he realized that the situation couldn’t be resolved by simply controlling one person’s thoughts. Furthermore, if all the politicians demonstrated a prejudiced stance favorable to the Jonathan Group, it could have adverse consequences.</p>
<p>In fact, he had anticipated that he would encounter a figure like Jack Benedict during the hearing. In reality, he wasn’t truly upset with Mary. His reaction was merely a reflection of his self-reproach. He felt ashamed because Mary had intervened because he appeared too irritable.</p>
<p>After he reviewed the recorded footage, he was even more embarrassed. His face was filled with extreme rage. Right when Jack Benedict claimed to establish the ‘Special Investigation Committee on the Monopoly of the Jonathan Investment Finance Group’ and just before Mary intervened.</p>
<p>The incident had been an illusion, but initially, it was hard to differentiate between what was real and what was illusory. He had actually tacitly allowed Olivia’s incursion. He should have refrained from allowing his emotions to overpower him, but he faltered.</p>
<p>However, if that incident were real, then he would have ruined Sun’s plan.</p>
<p>With my own hands…</p>
<p>He knew that he didn’t try to stop Olivia. It dawned on him that Mary might have assumed the guide of his closest aide as a wake-up call, to prompt him to understand the underlying motive. As he contemplated this, he felt a shiver run down his spine.</p>
<p>He was relieved that it wasn’t a reality, and what he realized was truly significant.</p>
<p>Soon, the door opened, and he heard Kim Cheong-Soo’s voice.</p>
<p>“The search and confiscation were dismissed as expected. However, they will persist in their efforts to obtain further evidence and try to manipulate the hearing in their favor. Perhaps it’s best to stop at this point? It’s not just my opinion, but the chairman apologized for Jack Benedict’s attitude and asked for your willingness.”</p>
<p>“We will continue.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo couldn’t respond immediately with a troubled face. Then, he soon came to his senses and lowered his head.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The hearing resumed late in the afternoon, and Jonathan entered with an indifferent face. He briefly scanned the reporters, and he could identify Mary this time. She appeared as an ordinary American female journalist to the live footage, but to him, she was Mary. He could tell from her attire.</p>
<p>- Jonathan: I see you there.</p>
<p>- Mary: Let me know if you change your mind. I will be waiting here for you.</p>
<p>- Jonathan: I won’t say thank you. You crossed the line. We should talk about this later today.</p>
<p>- Mary: Oh, but you still think the same? They speak nonsense without thinking much about it. I can stitch up their mouths right now if you want.</p>
<p>- Jonathan: Wow, that helps a lot.</p>
<p>- Mary: I’m serious. You are not the only one holding in anger. I just want to be helpful no matter what.</p>
<p>- Jonathan: You helped me enough… Just know that if you do something more, it would only interfere with my business.</p>
<p>- Mary: Okay. Just don’t forget that I’m here. Give me a sign if things go too tough for you.</p>
<p>Jonathan sat down and shook off his worries about Mary. She was as enraged as he was, but she could control herself much better than he could. If she didn’t suppress her anger, then she would have messed up the politician’s head before getting into his mind.</p>
<p>Then, the chairman brought his face close to the microphone.</p>
<p>“I have carefully considered Mr. Jack Benedict’s proposal on establishing the Special Investigation Committee on the Monopoly of the Jonathan Investment Finance Group. Our assembly’s opinion also coincides with the reason for the court’s dismissal of the search warrant. I ask you all not to forget why we have brought Mr. Hunter here today.”</p>
<p>However, the gazes of the assemblymen had changed significantly. Sighs also flowed out from the citizens who participated in the hearing as spectators. It could be seen as jeering.</p>
<p>Jonathan listened to the voices of the audience from the back while looking at the gazes of politicians in front of him as he opened his mouth, “I will do my best to correct misunderstandings and get rid of doubts.”</p>
<p>His voice was heavier despite his calm expression. From that point on, the chairman issued a strong warning to the audience and handed the floor over to the first speaker.</p>
<p>The details regarding the defense on the Day of Advent were discussed thoroughly. It was about what program was used for buying shares, who developed the system, and how many employees operated it.</p>
<p>Jonathan answered the questions with sincerity, and a problem arose when a House member took the floor.</p>
<p>「Jack Benedict, Democratic House Representative」</p>
<p>“Have you, Mr. Jonathan, ever directly exercised authority over all the companies, including those in the United States, in which you have secured a majority stake?”</p>
<p>He responded, “Of course, because I’m the owner of the Jonathan Group.”</p>
<p>“What authority did you exercise after returning from the Stage of Advent?” the congressman asked.</p>
<p>“None after the Stage of Advent was over.”</p>
<p>Jonathan wasn’t as sharp and cold as before.</p>
<p>“Then who has been in charge of this?”</p>
<p>“Brian Kim. He is the company’s Chief Financial Officer.”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo then took his place on the witness stand. From the onset of the hearing, there had been an empty table next to Jonathan, suggesting the committee’s plan to hold a joint hearing with Kim Cheong-Soo.</p>
<p>When Kim Cheong-Soo sat there, the sound of reporters pressing camera shutters immediately burst out again. Kim Cheong-Soo felt strange seeing Jonathan, whom he had just seen over the phone call and television earlier.</p>
<p>Jonathan’s eyes were once filled with anger, but now seemed to be full of determination. Kim Cheong-Soo calmed down after feeling the solid vibe from Jonathan. Therefore, he could easily get through the aggressive questions.</p>
<p>However, when he looked around the politicians, Jack Benedict opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“This is not a place to evaluate the morality of Jonathan Investment Finance Group. However, we should strictly assess how they could have grown rapidly in a short period of time. It’s truly surprising that no one has confirmed it yet.”</p>
<p>When he signaled the chairman, new figures were called to the witness stand. They were the executives leading the current social media market and Googol.</p>
<p>“Brian Kim.”</p>
<p>This time, Jack Benedict’s question was directed at Kim Cheong-Soo.</p>
<p>“Do you know Ethan? We wanted to bring the core figure of Jonathan Group, a person named Ethan to the hearing. However, he is…like a ghost for some reason. Do you know Ethan? Or is it another name for John Doe? Please answer, Mr. Kim.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 405</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo almost turned his head toward Jonathan but managed to barely turn toward the founders of Googol and Facenote. From the way they were sitting side by side at the witness stand, Kim Cheong-Soo realized the intent of Jack Benedict.</p>
<p>He responded, “Ethan is a freelancer outside of the company. We requested him as a consult on important contracts, and the Jonathan Group has relied heavily on his advice.”</p>
<p>“So you are saying he is not John Doe, right?” asked Jack Benedict.</p>
<p>He shook his head. “To my knowledge, John Doe is just an angel investor who provided initial funds when the headquarters of the Group was launched in 1997…”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict interrupted Kim Cheong-Soo, “Please answer with a simple yes or no. Is it difficult for you to answer like that?”</p>
<p>“As far as I know, John Doe is not Ethan.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then…”</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo added, “Ending like this will cause a lot of confusion and misunderstanding. You have pointed out that Ethan is like a ghost. Although he doesn’t work for Jonathan Group, he is like our co-worker. We have many freelancers like him.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then I will ask Mr. Zuckerberg.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict turned to the founder of Facenote. “Have you met a guy named Ethan? If so, when, where, and in what context did you meet him?”</p>
<p>“It was in Las Vegas in 2008, sir. Ethan was a legal representative for the Jonathan Group, and I was a contracting party.”</p>
<p>“Is it correct to say that Ethan had the right to handle all legal matters for the Jonathan Group?” asked the congressman.</p>
<p>“In terms of funding for Facenote… yes, that is right…”</p>
<p>“Have you met Ethan again since then?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Then, I will ask the same question, Mr. Larry. Do you remember your first time meeting with Ethan?” Jack Benedict now asked a question to one of the founders of Googol.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. Ethan was the first man who contacted me from the Jonathan Group.”</p>
<p>“How did he introduce himself?”</p>
<p>“He said he was assisting the Jonathan Group’s work from outside of the company. We first met at the headquarters, but the specific investment agreement was discussed with the King of Hell, Jonathan Hunter.”</p>
<p>“Have you met Ethan after that?”</p>
<p>“Not until after the successful IPO in 2003.”</p>
<p>“What was that for?”</p>
<p>“We had a small celebration together.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“There are many people who have forgotten that moment just by looking at us right now. However, there were many negative perspectives toward IPO back then.”</p>
<p>“Then, many people would have seen Ethan at that celebration.”</p>
<p>“No. It was only between Mr. Hunter, Ethan, and me.”</p>
<p>“How did Mr. Hunter and Ethan’s relationship look that day?”</p>
<p>“We were so drunk that day, sir. We were enjoying our sense of accomplishment. We were all equal on that day like friends.”</p>
<p>“Let me change the question, Mr. Larry.”</p>
<p>“Yes, go ahead.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict continued as he held up his phone, “Let’s say I move with this APhone. Can Googol track where I’m going? I’m asking if Googol can track my location.”</p>
<p>The founder of Googol was bewildered by the sudden change in topic.</p>
<p>“I cannot answer that without excluding specific circumstances, sir. Because among the services you use, there are…”</p>
<p>“Whether it’s Barry’s APhone or Ilsung’s Galaxy, many American citizens, including myself, use Googol’s services.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict instantly opened his email account on the spot.</p>
<p>“This is Googol’s Gmail.”</p>
<p>Then, Jack Benedict pointed out the apps installed on the smartphone one by one, including the world’s largest video platform.</p>
<p>“I use applications that are integrated with Googol’s Gmail, Mr. Larry. I will ask you again. Can Googol track my location?”</p>
<p>The entrepreneur responded, “If you have agreed to use your location in some services…”</p>
<p>“So you mean the window that pops up when you link your Google account, right?” asked Jack Benedict.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It would be harder to find people who didn’t check that box than someone who did. I probably have agreed with it too. That’s normal, Mr. Larry.”</p>
<p>“Sorry, sir. But in specific ways…”</p>
<p>“I’m talking about the general case right now. Googol can track users’ locations, even without implanting microchips like the registered Awakened. Then, let’s move on to the next question. If you search for ‘hero’ on Googol, the logo of Jonathan Finance Investment Group comes up first on Googol Images. We can check that right now. Not the World Awakened Association, but the logo of Jonathan Group’s logo.”</p>
<p>“If you are asking if we interfere with specific search results, we do not. Search results are created according to priority based on the aggregate information generated by users. However, the priority I’m talking about now refers to the convenience, relevance, and connectedness of overall users, not specific individuals or companies.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you think the logo of Jonathan Investment Finance Group comes up when you search ‘hero?’”</p>
<p>“That is…”</p>
<p>“Do you have a verification system for ensuring that search results are generated correctly? Please answer yes or no.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What is it like?”</p>
<p>“It is done by external evaluators. It would take a considerable amount of time to explain the verification system in detail right now.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that human factors are involved?” asked the congressman.</p>
<p>“To simplify the statement…”</p>
<p>“Please answer yes or no.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Does Googol collect user information? Names, addresses, emails, records, search history, IP addresses, mobile identification codes, GPS signals, and Wi-Fi signals.”</p>
<p>“If you create a Googol account…”</p>
<p>“Mr. Larry.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Information is collected in some cases. However, we own an accurate system in place for handling this information, sir.”</p>
<p>“Is Googol independent from Jonathan Investment Finance Group? I could reword and ask you more bluntly. Can the Jonathan Group replace the current Googol’s CEO and management at the next shareholders’ meeting?”</p>
<p>“...Yes.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict’s question was directed at the young founder of Facenote. “Mr. Zuckerberg.”</p>
<p>The founder of Facenote quickly put down the water bottle he was holding as his name was called.</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“The current President has stopped investigating Facenote, but I cannot help but bring the incident up again. During the election, there were 5.6 million election advertisements on former Secretary of State Clinton on Facenote. In contrast, the number of current President’s election advertisements on Facenote didn’t even reach sixty thousand. Therefore, many great Americans are still concerned that Facenote has a political bias.”</p>
<p>“No, sir. We absolutely did not discriminate against either one of them.”</p>
<p>“But the data shows a ninety-fold difference. At the time, many Republican supporters encountered the former Secretary of State’s face and slogans through Facenote’s advertisements. Isn’t it valid to suspect that Facenote is being used as a political tool? That’s why I am asking again.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Is Facenote independent from Jonathan Group?”</p>
<p>Cold sweat ran down on the young founder of Facenote’s face as he said, “No.”</p>
<p>“The Jonathan Investment Finance Group is the largest shareholder in some companies and a major shareholder in others. However, the reason why we notified Googol and Facenote to attend among multiple companies is because of the commonalities between them.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“First is their influence on society, and the second is the fact that the Jonathan Group has directly invested in both places. Jonathan Group boldly invested in Googol when it was one of the many venture companies and acquired Facenote before it went public, at a much higher price than its existing worth at the moment. It was as if they foresaw the current state of Googol and Facenote. Ethan was the one who carried out these investments, and he was the core figure with great achievements in Jonathan Group.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“The amount of money Ethan brought to Jonathan Group is an amount that ordinary people can’t even imagine. I believe Ethan brought more than just money to the group, but Ethan is still an external member, isn’t he?” Jack Benedict was now asking Kim Cheong-Soo.</p>
<p>Kim Cheong-Soo responded, “That is right.”</p>
<p>“I have looked into Ethan’s tax records and realized Jonathan Group has never paid him anything despite his hard work. Mr. Kim even said he was like a co-worker to the employees in the group. Surprisingly, he had nothing, from housing to assets. I couldn’t believe it even after checking it with my eyes. Isn’t Ethan a contributor and co-worker to Jonathan Group?”</p>
<p>“I have already mentioned, but…”</p>
<p>“Or is he in a position where he doesn’t need to receive separate performance payments from the group? I can still think of only one person who could be like that.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict finished his sentence with a full stop. Then, he continued, “Yes, John Doe.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>- Mary: Are you going to let this bastard keep going on with this?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s voice echoed in Jonathan’s head, but he didn’t answer.</p>
<p>‘Although he is talking about Ethan and John Doe…’</p>
<p>Jonathan could see Jack Benedict’s real intention. If he hadn’t been able to suppress his anger and hadn’t learned anything from Mary, then he would have been fooled by him or smacked the table in fury.</p>
<p>Ethan and John Doe were merely instruments for Jack Benedict. His message had already been conveyed. Basically, the Jonathan Group posed a threat, Googol and Facenote were only the tip of the iceberg, and with their complete financial might, they could cause even greater harm to the public.</p>
<p>That was what he was implicitly telling the public, just as they wanted to hear by attracting public support and highlighting the closed nature of Jonathan Group. His ultimate goal was to pass the seizure and search. If he succeeded in that, then he would be in the spotlight as a candidate for the next presidential election.</p>
<p>If he actually made it to the White House and received an invitation to the club, what expression would he show then? Jonathan couldn’t help but smirk inwardly, imagining it.</p>
<p>Anyway, since he started talking about it, he will try to check our morality now.</p>
<p>There was nothing better to discredit Jonathan Group’s morality than the 2008 subprime crisis. Although Rothschild took the blame, the fact that Jonathan Group caused the worst-case scenario of the crisis remained the same.</p>
<p>Jonathan was determined to end the hearing before politicians brought it up, and he thought this was the perfect time to cover up the filth by drawing the attention that had been diverted at John Doe toward himself and providing a bigger issue for those who mentioned the dismantling of the Jonathan Group.</p>
<p>It was at this moment that he ordered the President of the United States to pass the hearing!</p>
<p>“John Doe cannot be Ethan.”</p>
<p>Jonathan’s voice echoed heavily throughout the hall. He appeared to be firm which had been shown when entering the hearing.</p>
<p>“Ethan is my old friend, and I swear we give each other full support. Even if it is not recorded in the computers, it doesn’t mean that it didn’t happen.”</p>
<p>The reporters who had an intuition of breaking news zoomed into Jonathan’s face.</p>
<p>“I will make it clear here. John Doe is the name of my borrowed-name account.”</p>
<p>Finally, the sound of people pressing camera shutters burst out. Even though it was a live broadcast, the members of the assembly could not hide their shock. Some even moaned. This was also true for Jack, the assemblyman who had been leading the hearing.</p>
<p>- Mary: Are you fucking crazy? What is wrong with you? Do you even know what you are talking about?</p>
<p>“I, Jonathan Hunter, am John Doe.”</p>
<p>Jonathan put strength into his voice. When he stood up, a crimson blaze was already glaring from his entire body.</p>
<p>“So now I ask you all. How are you going to put me in jail?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 406</p>
<p>Jonathan was surrounded by the flames that surged up from his body. The King of Hell had descended. The flames writhed with the potential to burn everything around in a single breath, and in the next breath, they were sucked into his body altogether. Now, flames like wisps rose from Jonathan’s entire body.</p>
<p>“I asked what authority you will wield to put me on trial, Jack Benedict.”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict started to tremble horribly as Jonathan questioned him as if he was scolding him. The congressman’s face stiffened because the subject of his relentless interrogation had transformed into a supernatural being, tinged with red flames.</p>
<p>The fire quickly engulfed the table where Jonathan had been sitting, so it was only a matter of time for it to collapse and turn into black ashes.</p>
<p>“Are you qualified to command me? Do you have the power to enforce it?”</p>
<p>Jonathan’s voice wasn’t filled with anger. On the contrary, he was incredibly calm.</p>
<p>“Probably not because the reality is different from your wildest dreams. You guys need my consent to put me on trial, just like when I accepted the hearing today.”</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the heat that had started to fill the air became more terrifying, and even more frightening was the fact that he had revealed a portion of his dreadful abilities in an official setting, watched by the entire world. The representatives realized that Jonathan could turn the room into hell at any moment, depending on his mood, and that they had no means to stop him.</p>
<p>What could have led to this far, where even the slightest provocation triggered an explosion of Jonathan Hunter? What had awakened the financier, Jonathan Hunter, into the King of Hell?</p>
<p>The answer was simple. The politicians looked at Jack Benedict with a mixture of fear and pressure. However, he could neither stand up nor utter a single word.</p>
<p>Everyone quieted down. They were afraid that the sound of a sigh or the slightest movement might cause their heads to explode. Therefore, the hall was eerily quiet, and Jonathan’s voice became even more prominent.</p>
<p>“Two months ago, Awakened and civilians were burned to death in the occupied territory of the RMC Group, the Franklin Duchy. The association classified the creature that attacked them as a transcendent being. You may feel fear of me now, but I am afraid of that attitude. The monster’s flames will be fiercer than mine, and it will be full of aggression without any mercy.”</p>
<p>The flames blazing on Jonathan’s body responded steadily to his voice.</p>
<p>“Such transcendent beings exist among our enemies. Who can be sure that none of them will attack us? Even Odin, the strongest of the Awakened, cannot guarantee that.”</p>
<p>Jonathan stepped forward.</p>
<p>Although the only destroyed areas in the room were the immediate vicinity where Jonathan had stood and the distance he had walked, his appearance that the camera captured seemed like he was standing in the center of a battlefield. The ashes under his feet flared up into embers and spread in the air quickly.</p>
<p>“Now that I mentioned transcendent beings, I think it has resolved the doubts about Odin’s whereabouts to those who have been wondering. The association has promised peace and prosperity, and we have been working to keep the promise.”</p>
<p>Jonathan looked at the representatives and the audience, then continued, “The results are well known to everyone. Alien invasions are being treated as trivial issues in public, and the wealth I have created has been defined as a new enemy. All of this is possible only because our world is peaceful.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“That was why the entire association board, including myself, had to be more cautious. That was why we refrained from mentioning transcendent beings. We didn’t want to provoke a sense of crisis in the barely regained peace.”</p>
<p>Jonathan’s voice continued to be gentle as if he was trying to soothe the audience.</p>
<p>“I am not denying our current peace. Why would I? All I desperately want is peace for all of humanity. But that doesn’t mean I’m turning a blind eye to what hasn’t happened yet. Right now, I am talking about the reality that every single one of us is facing.”</p>
<p>Crack-!</p>
<p>“The uncomfortable truth that everyone wanted to ignore.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>For a moment, Jonathan felt the weight of the burden Sun was carrying, and his heart grew heavy. His expression revealed this emotion as well.</p>
<p>“Transcendent beings are not an immediate threat to humanity because Odin is directly and the Awakened are indirectly blocking their attacks. However, if they fail and our world turns into a battlefield, can you imagine the aftermath of that day?”</p>
<p>He became silent for a long time after saying that. Quite some time passed before he spoke again.</p>
<p>“Jack Benedict.”</p>
<p>The assemblyman was still overwhelmed by the fear. When he came to his senses, he found himself politely responding without even realizing it, “Yes…”</p>
<p>“What is the current state of the global stock market?”</p>
<p>Jack Benedict answered after checking his smartphone, “Well…it’s on a downward trend.”</p>
<p>By the time the hearing had started, the once-thriving market had reversed its course.</p>
<p>Jonathan continued, “It is because I mentioned the term ‘transcendent beings.’ It is also because no one can predict which direction I will take. The markets are going down because there is fear that the world will change for the worse from today on. This calculator might even include your deaths. So if I really start to burn you all down in this fire…”</p>
<p>Sparks gathered in Jonathan’s clenched fist. Of course, he understood the things that Sun wanted to protect, but it was true that he couldn’t truly empathize with Sun.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, a murderous intent beyond the flames passed through Jonathan’s eyes, which were fixed on Jack Benedict. Right then, Jack Benedict tightly closed his eyes. Despite the considerable distance between them, Jonathan’s flames seemed dangerously poised to fly toward him at any moment.</p>
<p>However, all that spread out was the sound of Jonathan’s voice.</p>
<p>“Fear will burst out in the market. It will be stopped at once, and the financial market will be temporarily paralyzed. However.”</p>
<p>The flames were retrieved back by Jonathan’s fists.𝒇𝘳ee𝚠𝘦𝚋n૦𝐯el coｍ</p>
<p>“It will quickly stabilize as long as I don’t dispose of our group’s assets, and as long as the capital forces called ‘Defenders of the Day of Advent’ don’t join their ranks.”</p>
<p>Jonathan didn’t stop there.</p>
<p>“Whether it is transcendent beings or even greater threats, I will always bet on the safety of humanity.”</p>
<p>Then, he shifted his gaze from the assemblyman to the audience.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“I understand the meaning of the protest starting in America, in front of our group’s headquarters. But I also wondered why there were no voices speaking up for me, and if the protestors truly represented the voice of the Americans. These so-called Americans only cried out about wealth inequality, but why didn’t they say anything about how the Jonathan Group was making America stronger?”</p>
<p>The second story about the uncomfortable truth began.</p>
<p>“The reason why the current president was elected in the last elections was due to the desire of Americans who wanted to see a stronger nation.”</p>
<p>Jonathan continued, “Our group had no choice but to secure a large number of shares in global groups while defending the Day of Advent. These shares make up 22.3 percent of the global stock market.”</p>
<p>The audience stayed silent.</p>
<p>“Remember that the Jonathan Group, unlike other financial groups, does not have its headquarters overseas. We are an American company, and we can proudly say that we have been faithfully paying our taxes.</p>
<p>“Then, what does it mean that our group holds 22.3 percent of the global stock market? This year, we have the right to receive dividends from global companies at that proportion, and the U.S. government has secured thirty-five percent of those dividends in corporate tax revenue.</p>
<p>“As the market expands into outer space and the global companies’ operating profits increase, the U.S. government’s national budget will also increase each year. However, this is only about dividends. If we consider the amount Jonathan Group is making in China, how much will the U.S. government’s national budget increase from that?</p>
<p>“As a result, how far will the United States become wealthier, and who will benefit from it? It is the Americans, you guys, who are currently condemning the wealth I possess.”</p>
<p>Jonathan suppressed the urge to shove his face toward the audience.</p>
<p>“The Awakened still have a vague concept of the nation as they are accustomed to the days when they belonged under the name of a captain, under the name of a powerful corps commander. It is the same for me as well, but why am I talking about America’s prosperity now? At least Americans should have looked back at reality once more before condemning the wealth I possess.”</p>
<p>There wasn’t even a sound of a single breath from the audience. No one could dare to have the courage to question Jonathan right in front of him. Their initial fervor had faded in the heat emitted by Jonathan.</p>
<p>“There are monsters that grow by eating the corpses of their fellows among the Kciphos Corps. The process of achieving my current wealth is similar to that. I have swallowed up large financial forces, and their capital accumulated as my wealth.”</p>
<p>“Americans are talking about the extreme concentration of wealth, but the notion has taken place for a long time. You, ordinary citizens, can’t say that I have robbed your pockets. What has changed in your lives? There is no difference from before.”</p>
<p>At that point, Jonathan somehow calmed his rage down. As the story went on, emotions were gradually overlapping, increasing his anger. He wanted to scold not only Americans but also the entire world, but decided to stop. He had gone far enough.</p>
<p>“I apologize sincerely for drawing out the power of the Awakened in the official hearing. There will be no such thing in the future.”</p>
<p>If I was Sun, I would say this and not lower my head…</p>
<p>Jonathan frowned inwardly and lowered his face toward the audience, politicians, then the cameras. Then, his voice that burst out was even more settled.</p>
<p>“However, that is the reality. Transcendent beings exist, and you have no power to put me on trial. What means can you command me by? Even under the UN, I am a person not subject to the law.”</p>
<p>Jonathan swallowed some saliva.</p>
<p>“But I will stand on trial. I am here today because many Americans were crying out for John Doe. I will accept the judgment of the judiciary for using anonymous transactions. Even if you doubt my sincerity and attack me like this just by looking at my wealth, I will show that the Jonathan Investment Finance Group is not above the law. Neither am I. If that is the way to maintain the order we have kept, I will gladly accept it. Why not?”</p>
<p>Srrr-</p>
<p>The red flames rising from Jonathan’s body disappeared. Jonathan finally looked towards the chairman.</p>
<p>“Please notify me of the date. I will attend the court.”</p>
<p>It was a single phrase that changed the situation at once.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 407</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol was overwhelmed by a surge of emotion that welled up from deep inside his heart. Seeing the flames that looked like they would burst through the monitor and hearing his dignified and solemn voice, Jonathan Hunter was indeed the King of Hell, just like his codename.</p>
<p>My dad…is working with these incredible people? No way. That’s unbelievable.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol shifted his gaze to a framed picture on the computer desk, and there was a photo of him and his dad together that was taken recently.</p>
<p>You haven’t gotten your wife back from the old, ugly guy.</p>
<p>As he looked at his dad’s foolishly smiling face, it felt even more surreal. He couldn’t feel anything extraordinary from his dad like he did from the King of Hell. All his dad knew was to scratch his butt inside his underwear. Even though the Awakened said he was scary, Seong-Il was just an ordinary middle-aged man to Ki-Cheol.</p>
<p>Even when Ki-Cheol witnessed his dad’s crazy jumping ability, like leaping over tall buildings, and his Hulk-like strength, it was only for a moment.</p>
<p>Well…if he had to pinpoint the changes in his dad like other Awakened, then it had to be a month ago. Seong-Il had given away the money he earned by selling a godlike item, the God of Wind’s Protective Ring, to the family of the deceased Awakened, whom he used to work with in the Stage of Advent. It was over two hundred billion won, but his dad gave it all away, leaving a single penny.</p>
<p>This was the same person who used to fight with his mom over money. Of course, his mom came over because of this incident, and they fought again.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol shook off the unpleasant memory of that day and continued to move the mouse. He found the entire video of the hearing and paused at one particular scene. The constantly changing subtitles at the bottom also stopped at that moment.</p>
<p>「I, Jonathan Hunter, am John Doe. So now I ask you all. How are you going to put me in jail?」</p>
<p>Although there was a clear difference in power at each level, his dad was ranked right after the King of Hell, who was also in the same challenger section. In terms of the ability alone, the King of Hell was fourth, and his dad was fifth.</p>
<p>But how can people be so different?</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol shouted outside of his room, toward the living room of their apartment, where his mom and dad had a big fight a month ago.</p>
<p>“Hey, mister! Is it impossible for the United States government to apprehend my dad? Probably, right?”</p>
<p>The sound of the television continued to come out from the living room.</p>
<p>“Good evening, we interrupt your regularly scheduled programming to bring you breaking news. Moments ago, it was confirmed that the notorious King of Hell, Jonathan Hunter, has accepted the U.S. judiciary’s ruling on anonymous transactions, leading to the closure of the hearing. The situation is developing rapidly and we did not turn to our correspondent on the ground, reporting from the Wall Street rally. Chan-Sol Kim, it is clear that this news has reverberated throughout the protest. Can you tell us more about the reactions from the demonstrators?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The unwavering commitment to global peace by Jonathan Hunter seems to have resonated with the protestors. The ATAC leadership has called for unity among the protestors and emphasized Hunter’s bold and obvious warning not only to the U.S. government but also to the entire world.</p>
<p>However, as you can see, many protestors are now attempting to resume their daily routines. It is a harsh reality that the U.S. government stands to lose much if tensions between Hunter and the authorities continue to escalate. Even when news of his attendance at the hearing broke…”</p>
<p>The Awakened, who worked as bodyguards at Ki-Cheol’s house, approached him with a tense expression.</p>
<p>“What did you ask?”</p>
<p>However, Ki-Cheol hadn’t seen such an expression on the man before. He somehow felt scared and quickly answered him, “Never mind. I won’t disturb you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol closed the door and habitually checked his advertisement revenue as usual. Although his video updates had stopped at the end of May, the views on the previous videos were rapidly increasing due to the aftermath of the hearing. Revenue was also soaring.</p>
<p>The video that attracted the most views was the one in which he showcased a bit of his father’s challenger section skills.</p>
<p>「Estimated Revenue: $252,925</p>
<p>Last 30 days (2018.06.26 - 2018.07.25)」</p>
<p>There were several reasons why he was not uploading more clips. Some comments criticized him, claiming that Ki-Cheol shouldn’t have used a global resource like Caliber Kwon Seong-Il as content for his own profit. He could ignore those comments by considering the fans who cared for Invincible Caliber TV.</p>
<p>However, when the ‘Franklin Duchy’s disaster’ was mentioned in the hearing, Ki-Cheol realized that outer space wasn’t a mere fantasy as even the Awakened could die horribly. Some of the dead Awakened belonged to the Revolucion (12). They weren’t just casual members of the group, but they had directly followed his dad’s orders. That was what his father had explained with a serious face at the time.</p>
<p>At the moment, his dad had plans to enter outer space, so Ki-Cheol didn’t want to use the dangerous battlefield as content. And now, that fact was confirmed. Even the King of Hell was afraid of that transcendent being.</p>
<p>The other reason why he had stopped uploading videos was that many issues arose at once as advertisement revenue increased. He had expected to make this much money, but once it became a reality, there were multiple problems.</p>
<p>Back when adults complained about it, he didn’t understand how painful it was to pay taxes. He also didn’t know that one had to pay taxes to the country when one earned money and that the government would take away so much money. He noticed that the amount of taxes depended on the amount one earned.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was shocking to find out that if he made five hundred million won, he needed to pay more than forty-two percent of it as taxes to the country. It was an outrageous and suffocating situation.</p>
<p>He then understood why popular creators joined large management companies as they helped them pay fewer taxes. They not only discussed content direction together and helped with various events, but they also connected Invincible Caliber TV-like celebrities to public broadcasting and joint broadcasts with famous creators from other countries.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Ki-Cheol made a promise to his dad when he started internet broadcasting. Whether it worked or not, Seong-Il said Ki-Cheol needed to handle this only with his friend. His dad’s words were, “I will earn money, so you just do whatever you want for fun. If there is something you need to learn, then do that. If it doesn’t work, then just quit.”</p>
<p>Many adults had approached him through Facenote, but there were even more people who contacted him only because of his father’s reputation. Accountants and lawyers sent messages to him as well by saying that they could help him with taxes.</p>
<p>Money, money, money. It was all because of money. Adults had an amazing ability to sniff out money.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He started studying economics out of frustration and incomprehension. What was the country doing, taking nearly half of his money? He had persuaded his dad to create content, promoted his channel on websites, and endured malicious comments.</p>
<p>Studying economics was challenging, but it was more fun than schoolwork. He felt a sense of accomplishment when he discovered new things. He learned why he had to pay taxes to the country and how his taxes were used. It still infuriated him though.</p>
<p>To pay as few taxes as possible, he needed to establish a corporation, and he found out that the money earned there was not legally his own.</p>
<p>It’s my money, but it’s not?</p>
<p>Therefore, if he used it carelessly and got caught, he could go to jail or pay a fine, and that was why the whole country was noisy about the illegal funds of the conglomerates. So, the money in the corporation was not his money, and if he secretly hoarded it, it was considered theft.</p>
<p>This is ridiculous!</p>
<p>Such hoarded money was commonly called ‘slush funds,’ and usually, when one hoarded a slush fund, they put the money in someone else’s bank account. This process was called a ‘borrowed-name transaction” because they were borrowed in someone else’s name.</p>
<p>「I will make it clear here. John Doe is the name of my borrowed-name account.」</p>
<p>But the issue of slush funds seems to be a different problem. Ah, this is frustrating.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol was worried about the outcome since the King of Hell announced that he would personally accept the trial. Although it was the King of Hell’s business, it could inevitably affect his dad as well.</p>
<p>After searching the internet for a while, he remembered that there was one adult who had told him to contact them if he ever had questions or needed advice. Jamie was one of them, but he excluded her for now because he realized how great she was while studying economics. He also excluded all the adults who had sent him friend requests on Facenote.</p>
<p>The words of the Caliber’s son could become controversial even for something trivial. He had learned this through mean comments, related articles, and other video content.</p>
<p>Therefore, he decided to contact a young woman who worked with his father.</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Hello.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Is this Ki-Cheol?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Yes, ma’am.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;You can just call me by my name. Anyway… Did Mr. Caliber come back to your home?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Huh? Did he come back?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Sorry. I should have told you this earlier.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: No, my dad should do that himself. But, is Dad okay? He didn’t get hurt, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;He is Mr. Caliber. If he is not fine, that is a big problem. He just returned not too long ago. He will be home soon.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Ah, okay…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Why?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Did you watch the hearing?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Of course.&gt;</p>
<p>Excited emotions trembled beyond the phone.</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: The King of Hell…. No, no. Mr. King of Hell announced that John Doe is his borrowed-name account and said he will stand in court. I just have a question about it. If you are available now, could you give me a brief explanation about it? I can learn the rest on the Internet…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol, you sound like an adult. Hey, it’s okay. Hmmm… The borrowed-named account is… like… with another person’s name…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: I know what a borrowed-name account is. I also know that it’s usually used when dealing with slush funds.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Wow, that’s impressive. Do they teach that thing in middle school these days?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: I studied by myself. But all this chaos is not because of slush funds, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Not all borrowed-name accounts are used for slush funds. I don’t know how much you have studied, but what exactly are you curious about?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Could the King of Hell go to jail? He said himself that he would stand in court. That means he would accept any verdict, whether it is imprisonment or a fine, right? What if he gets imprisoned?&gt;</p>
<p>A short laugh came from the woman.</p>
<p>&lt;That is what makes him incredibly amazing, Ki-Cheol.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Ki-Cheol: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;I am also curious about the verdict in the U.S. as well, Ki-Cheol. Study more and teach me, okay?&gt;</p>
<p>Then, he heard the sound of the door lock unlocking from outside the living room.</p>
<p>“Welcome back, Mr. Caliber.”</p>
<p>Following the voice of the bodyguard, Seong-Il’s loud voice burst out.</p>
<p>“Ki-Cheol! Son! Dad is back! Hahaha— Your dad occupied the kingdom! I should drink some soju tonight. With my son!”</p>
<p>His excitement lasted only for a few seconds as his gaze became fixed on the living room television.</p>
<p>“Shit… What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 408</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol had been waiting for his dad, Seong-Il, to return from outer space ever since he left. However, when his dad finally came back, he couldn’t bring himself to speak to him. The sight of his dad standing still, facing the television, seemed somehow threatening.</p>
<p>It was different from the scary expression the bodyguard had shown, as it was more intimidating and looked dangerous. It seemed as if something invisible was coming out of his dad’s back and filling the entire living room. Although he could only see his dad’s back, he could tell that his dad was pissed.</p>
<p>The Awakened bodyguard froze as well after feeling the palpable tension. Then, Seong-Il sat down. When he stretched out his arm and said “remote control,” Ki-Cheol and the bodyguard flinched at the same time.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol swallowed his saliva and finally got the answer to the question he had been wondering. His dad was an Awakened in the challenger section, just like the King of Hell. He was one of those who fought numerous battles in the Stage of Advent and dominated the Awakened with overwhelming power.</p>
<p>His dad could be scarier than anyone else when he was furious.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A while later, Seong-Il entered Ki-Cheol’s room. At that time, Ki-Cheol was immersed in a web document on his monitor.</p>
<p>Using a borrowed-name account is bad because it is used for illegal purposes. Bribing high-ranked people in society, hiding slush funds, and not paying taxes. That is why the law prohibits it..!</p>
<p>Suddenly, the door flung open loudly, and a gaze fell on Ki-Cheol’s head while emitting lots of pressure.</p>
<p>Heup!</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol looked up in surprise. His father was not smiling like he usually did. Instead, he had a stiff look on his face. Ki-Cheol could only see his back before, but he could now look up at his father’s face. He appeared to be a completely different person as his eyes were filled with fury. The person in front of him didn’t seem like his dad at all, and that was why Ki-Cheol was trembling.</p>
<p>It felt like something that looked like his dad had entered the room. The existence of what the mean comments were talking about the Awakened…</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s eyes shook at that moment. He tried to smile at Ki-Cheol, but his awkwardly forced smile only made things more uncomfortable.</p>
<p>“People get angry in life sometimes. You are always mad at your mom and me, so I have the right to get angry, son. I’m human, too.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il ruffled Ki-Cheol’s hair as he finished speaking. Ki-Cheol obediently stayed still.</p>
<p>“Let me use the computer.”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol hurriedly moved away from his seat and looked at the living room. He was hesitant to go out there as the fury Seong-Il left still remained. The bodyguard Awakened was standing there too, extremely tense.</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol stood behind Seong-Il, and Seong-Il searched for and played the entire hearing clip. The point where he paused the video was when the King of Hell had just entered the room and sat down in front of the table. To be exact, it was when the reporters lost their minds and shoved all sorts of cameras at his face.</p>
<p>Seong-Il stared at it for a while before going back to the living room and turning on his phone. Once seated, he didn’t take his eyes off an Asian female reporter. Others might have missed it, but she was undoubtedly Mary.</p>
<p>She let those jerks do that? Motherfuckers.</p>
<p>However, she wasn’t picking up his call. Seong-Il said as he pointed at the monitor with his chin, “Hey, Ki-Cheol. I just have to go there right now, so why don’t you go stay with your mom?”</p>
<p>“I told you that I don’t like her place…”</p>
<p>Ki-Cheol couldn’t bring himself to ask if his father could get married again with his mom as it wasn’t the right time for that.</p>
<p>Seong-Il said, “Something might happen. So you should be with your mom, protecting her.”</p>
<p>As Ki-Cheol was about to reluctantly agree, Seong-Il’s phone rang.</p>
<p>「Caller: Tae-Han bro」</p>
<p>Seong-Il gestured to Ki-Cheol to go out to the living room, and Ki-Cheol left hesitantly.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Hey, I was about to call you. Get the plane ready because I’m going. You know what is going on, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: Calm down, Seong-Il.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Calm down? I have an idea of what is happening. People shouldn’t do this to him. They are ungrateful like those bastards in the Stage of Advent.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: The King of Hell knows what he is doing.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: We were fighting against the Holy Knight and its corps, but they couldn’t stand it and started a protest instead? Those brats and the politician scumbags are all the same, and I will break their skulls open. They should be thankful to us for allowing them to stay warm and comfortable. These kinds of assholes need to taste blood to realize that.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: Are you at home? I will explain everything one by one.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: You would remember the preparation period for the Final Stage of Act One because you met Odin back then.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: Yes, I do.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: What was it like back then? You have only heard about it, so you wouldn’t know, but it wasn’t much different from now. Odin and I were back from the ox-heads’ mainland after dealing with them. Damn, I still remember that old guy’s name. Odin gave him the power and support to live well, but do you know what he said to us? He brought useless people over and said ‘I have twenty thousand behind me.’ Fucking ridiculous. He was just afraid that Odin would take away his power. If he had only brought the leadership along, I would have said nothing.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: Gosh, it’s amazing that you remember all this.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: How can I forget about that? The Sky Guild was disbanded on that day. The Ilsung Guild that you were in absorbed them, so even if everyone forgets, you should not.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: Okay.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: No matter what excuses they bring, it’s the same in the end. Those protesting do that because they are not getting that many benefits compared to the rich, and the politicians who support them just want to get more authority. We have dealt with situations like this multiple times on the Stage of Advent, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: And what happened when Odin was sealed for a long time? You and I had such a hard time handling the lower ones. If we start talking about that, then we will be able to talk about it for a week.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: That is true.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Those ungrateful assholes are doing all of this for their own selfish reasons. It only gets worse when they do it in a group. If they were rich like the King of Hell, then they never would have started protesting. Seoul is in chaos now too.&gt;</p>
<p>Seong-Il rambled on for a long time, and Lee Tae-Han responded only with short answers, waiting for Seong-Il’s rage to subside. However, Seong-Il didn't settle down easily.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Have you tried contacting Mary noona? She seems to be in the United States.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: I haven't tried yet.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Ah, then what about Odin? If he gives the order, I will be at the frontline. You know what Odin values most, right? It’s obvious. Dragorin is not the problem right now.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: That is why.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: What do you mean?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: The King of Hell is following Odin’s will, so please calm down. There is a bigger world than you know.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Are you talking about the club? Why wouldn’t I know? I have been with Odin for decades.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Tae-Han: No, you only know it by its name. I will come to pick you up and explain everything, so get some rest. I won’t take long.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: You drive me nuts, bro. Okay. I’ll see you soon.&gt;</p>
<p>Seong-Il was now craving alcohol.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: You better bring tons of soju. I can’t stand not drinking tonight.&gt;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Tae-Han arrived shortly after he used a helicopter. Seong-Il was in the bathtub at that time, so Ki-Cheol and the bodyguard greeted Lee Tae-Han. Although Ki-Cheol had met Lee Tae-Han before, Tae-Han’s status was higher now than it was then. Ki-Cheol’s mind was filled with the sound of a huge bell as he stood in front of the other man.</p>
<p>Soon, Ki-Cheol came to his senses and bowed politely. When Lee Tae-Han patted his shoulder and passed by, Ki-Cheol touched the shoulder where Tae-Han’s hand had been and smiled faintly. He realized his dad had indeed been among these great people.</p>
<p>Seong-Il came out, only wearing underwear as he complained, “Why did you not bring anything? I told you to bring boxes of soju.”</p>
<p>On his chest was a large scar from the last battle in the Empire. Around the linear shallow wound that had been sliced by a sword, the skin tissue had shriveled to a dark color as the blood supply had been cut off.</p>
<p>Seong-Il spoke nonchalantly as Ki-Cheol and Lee Tae-Han widened their eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing. It will heal on its own. The opponent was weaker than the one Osiris faced.”</p>
<p>“But still…” Lee Tae-Han said.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shrugged. “I killed all of them, so the empire is mine now.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il recalled the Holy Knight, who used to be the emperor of the empire and his followers. Then, he clicked his tongue.</p>
<p>“Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Kwon Ki-Cheol. Tae-Han is like my real brother. Did you say hi?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did,” Ki-Cheol replied.</p>
<p>“Then, go back to your room. He and I have lots to talk about.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il also sent the bodyguard into his room.</p>
<p>“Kids these days have no manners, and I won’t let my son have that attitude. Did he actually say hi? I just want him to be kind and welcoming toward others.”</p>
<p>“Yes, he did,” Tae-Han answered.</p>
<p>“Okay, then. Did you come by helicopter?” asked Seong-Il.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It must be around here then.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il’s muscles swelled for a moment. Lee Tae-Han grasped the signal and switched to telepathic communication. He went straight to the main point of why he had to come to see Seong-Il in person.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: The King of Hell identified himself as John Doe, but John Doe is actually Odin.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Did you think I didn’t know that?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Odin’s assets are not limited to the Jonathan Investment Finance Group. The revealed property is just the tip of an iceberg. There is nothing in the global major and all areas that aren’t his.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: So, the protestors are making a fuss just by looking at a speck of his money, right? Things would get worse if more gets revealed.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Yes, with just that, there were voices saying that Jonathan Group should be dismantled for society’s sake. They probably tried to achieve their ultimate goal by starting with John Doe. But, in a broader perspective, that is just a small beginning.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: I see. Then, how powerful is the club?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: They lead global issues in politics, economics, and culture. Influential politicians, entrepreneurs, and military officials from around the world are members of the club. The King of Hell and Osiris have been supporting Odin as club members for years before the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: What about you?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: As you know, I first met Odin in the preparation period of the Final Stage of Act.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: But you were the CEO of Ilsung.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Ilsung is nothing compared to them.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Jeonil… Jamie… She seemed to have a deep connection with Odin.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: She is also a member of the club.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: So, the club is where all the influential people are gathered, right?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Mmm…not all the influential people because they are only about a hundred. It is where only the top of the top come together to rule the world. What you need to know is that the club is Odin’s control mechanism. His orders there are absolute. Before discussing the power of the Awakened, Odin has been ruling the world even before the Day of Advent. In this hearing, the King of Hell…</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Then, what about the President of the United States? Is he under Odin’s influence as well?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Yes.</p>
<p>Seong-Il quickly blinked.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: What about the President of Korea?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: No, he is not in the position to ever join the club.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Russia?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Although he is not a club member, Russia is influenced directly through their representative in the club.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Then… China?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: You can still check the consequences of challenging the club’s authority on television every day. They have almost been destroyed.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Japan?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: They are also not in the position to join the club.</p>
<p>Seong-Il recalled the scene of the Holy Knight dying. The other man faced his end as blood flowed out of his mouth and nose with eyes filled with horror. He seemed incredulous about his own death and appeared to have come to the realization that there was a higher power at play.</p>
<p>Seong-Il thought that he had the same look in his eyes right now. He was aware of the club, but not to this extent…</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: But why are Odin and the club staying quiet?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Odin believes things are going well at the moment.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Even though randos are protesting and being annoying?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: That is unfortunate, but punishing them is not what he wants. I don’t know all of his intentions, but…</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: But, what?</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han maintained a calmer tone than usual to avoid provoking Seong-Il.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: The reason why Odin entrusted the full authority of the club to the King of Hell was perhaps that he believed that the King of Hell would carry out his wishes better than anyone else.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: He entrusted the club’s full authority to him?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Yes. Neither you nor I know much about the King of Hell, but we have heard of how he ruled his corps up to the Final Stage. He was the Lord of Terror. Why would such a person suppress his anger?</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Then this is not a matter…that I should intervene in. So, what do you think will happen from now on? When these bastards group together, they will think that they are powerful enough to confront us. It won’t be easy to console them unless we kill them all.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: The King of Hell has focused everyone’s attention on himself through the trial. He wants to make sure no one talks about other issues anymore.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: So, he has drawn their attention quite well, right?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Yes. I think he will organize the media outlets that support our side and prolong the trial until the public’s fatigue reaches its peak. That is what I would do. By that time, the public’s enthusiasm won’t be the same.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: …I actually don’t know. Do we really need to care this much about these protesting assholes? Listening to you, we don’t even need to go as far as using the Awakened. The U.S. President is a puppet, right? It would be the same for our country. So, what is your stance?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: What do you mean..?</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: I just want to know what you honestly think. I think we could just push them away with the police without using the Awakened. Or I could handle it all by myself.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: I only follow Odin’s orders…</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Who doesn’t know that? Same for me. I only do as I am told.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: I think the current situation is better. Even without using force to control the world, Odin is already the ruler. It is just not visible on the surface, so why bother unifying the world with force?</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: No, I am not talking about conquering the world, but dealing with the protestors.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: Once we crush the public, it is only natural to follow that path. Then, we will end up suppressing them with greater force, and there will always be more resistance. Eventually, the moment will come when we think it will be better to unify the flags of the world.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: To that extent?</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: The protests triggered this time have the potential to explode into a massive uprising. If the public unites, then Odin will have no choice but to make a decision. Either to listen to the public’s voice or silence them with a sword. Odin doesn’t want it to come to that situation, so the King of Hell is carrying out that wish right now. This is the conclusion I have reached.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Hmm. Ruling the world is not an easy task. He must be facing so many difficulties.</p>
<p>- Tae-Han: So, you should never say that you will go to America, okay?</p>
<p>Seong-Il felt that the situation the King of Hell was facing wasn’t someone else’s business. The King of Hell had been preparing for the Day of Advent with Odin for a long time, and his feelings must have been even deeper and greater than Seong-Il’s.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Didn’t you hear me? I just do what I am told. Anyway, the King of Hell must be going through a tough time. Going through a trial in front of losers doesn’t sound fun. His pride felt as high as that of Osiris. Tsk, tsk. I can’t imagine how pissed he would be. I wish I could crack all those bastards’ skulls.</p>
<p>Seong-Il suddenly stopped talking and turned his head back toward where Lee Tae-Han’s gaze was fixed on the television. The volume had been minimized, so there was hardly any sound coming out.</p>
<p>A Korean news channel was using a recorded video from a foreign news source, showing a scene where a large crowd poured out as the hearing ended.</p>
<p>Seong-Il caught a glimpse of two familiar faces in the crowd, even though they quickly passed by. It wasn’t just Mary noona who had been watching the hearing. There was one more person who had disappeared into the crowd with her.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han said, “...Odin was also watching.”</p>
<p>He noticed that the blood-red energy of Doom Entegasto and his energy mixed together were not captured on camera, it seemed that the bone ring had completely become his possession.</p>
<p>Odin had returned after completing the Dragorin hunt.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 409</p>
<p>The street facing where the Congress was holding the hearing was crowded with special correspondents from around the world, relay vehicles, civilians, and police officers.</p>
<p>The police officers were on edge in the seemingly chaotic atmosphere, as if something could happen at any moment. As a result, they were exchanging radio messages, preparing for any possible situation. One officer, who was shouting at civilians not to come closer while pushing them away, had one hand on the holster. The protestors were trying to enter the facility, so it was natural for the police to be on high alert.</p>
<p>The situation was as terrible as expected. A collective uprising of the public… Perhaps Jonathan had willingly attended the hearing to try to address the issue before it got even worse.</p>
<p>Of course, it was completely natural for the public to feel injustice, fear, and anxiety. The world’s wealth was concentrated in the hands of an extreme minority…no, actually just one person. It was clear that capitalism had reached its peak in a negative way.</p>
<p>If a totalitarian ideology were to be combined with this, then it would have been more than enough to move toward the terrifying future shown in George Orwell’s [1984] and Aldous Huxley’s [Brave New World]. The reason why politicians at the hearing were attacking the founders of Googol and Facenote was that they knew those companies could replace the telescreen in [1984] and the Soma drugs in [Brave New World].</p>
<p>Therefore, I a hundred percent understood why the public was targeting John Doe and asking for the Jonathan Investment Finance Group to be dismantled. The world could easily fall into a true dystopian society with a single decision from me.</p>
<p>Starting with punishing those who dared to oppose me, what if I were to use the current protests and ongoing war as a pretext to emphasize the interests of the collective over the individual and exert direct control over all of humanity?</p>
<p>There would never be anything more frightening than such a world. It was a different kind of horror from the world destroyed by the Seven Demon Kings and their corps in the past.</p>
<p>Anyway, we achieved our current wealth solely because of a single idea as Jonathan mentioned. The world where all wealth was concentrated on me now was a result of us defending on the Day of Advent. I didn’t actually want this to happen.</p>
<p>But would I give up my current wealth as the public wished? No way.</p>
<p>Even if I dismantled the Jonathan Group and distributed my financial power as they demanded, the beneficiaries would not be the public. I could set up various devices to make them feel that they had benefited, but the truth was, the world would not change significantly. The few elites who received that power would only try to use it for their own good.</p>
<p>It was unnecessary to talk about what kind of catastrophe people like them had created in the past.</p>
<p>Even if someone who realized the truth of the world appeared and pointed their finger at me as in terrible self-righteousness, I could still argue that the Earth would be better off under my leadership, as I believed that I would be a benevolent dictator. In my opinion, the world needed to be governed this way.</p>
<p>I would also say that I was the only person who had directly witnessed the extinction of humanity and that it would be impossible to create a world where everyone would be equal. However, at least the world I ruled would be safe, and it would seem as if nothing had changed.</p>
<p>The hearing ended.</p>
<p>“Tell me the date. I will be in court.”</p>
<p>Jonathan’s firm voice came out from my clenched cell phone and from the phones of the crowd, which was hard to distinguish between protestors and ordinary citizens.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I felt sorry because I could tell how much Jonathan was suppressing himself in order to follow my commands from his short glances and every word he spoke. I was relieved as he didn’t show any signs of mistakenly understanding my intentions and declaring the dissolution of the Jonathan Group.</p>
<p>Out of all the choices I had made since traveling back in time, choosing Jonathan as my partner was the most favorable decision I had made.</p>
<p>Jonathan’s statements and attitude brought shock not only in the members of Congress but also to the people on the streets here. I could feel people’s attitudes beginning to change. The voices condemning Jonathan were still loud, but in between, some supported him. Tension started to form between the minority who supported Jonathan and the majority who did not.</p>
<p>As the entrance to the building was flooded with lawmakers and reporters, the flow of people on the street began to shift in that direction. Not only protestors but also foreign correspondents from around the world led their teams toward the politicians, like military reporters rushing through gunfire.</p>
<p>The police shouted in a louder voice.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: I’m here.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee appeared, taking off her press ID that was hanging around her neck. She smiled as she looked at my bone ring, but she appeared to be angry towards the surroundings.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you come in when you arrived?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee replaced her greeting with that question. She then cast a sharp gaze at those still shaking placards and condemning Jonathan. Since people like that could be seen everywhere, Yeon-Hee looked around in annoyance. Then, her gaze became fixed on the Awakened who were blending in with the crowd.</p>
<p>She seemed to have realized why I hadn’t entered the session to watch in person. Yes, it was because I was keeping an eye on the possibility of the Awakened breaking into the room. They had terrifying expressions and a formidable aura, which proved that they had fought monsters with Jonathan in the Final Stage.</p>
<p>In fact, they showed signs of trying to break into the session when Jonathan used his flames. They barely restrained themselves though.</p>
<p>We moved away from the Awakened to a quieter place. The area that the government had given to the association started just a few blocks down the street, where the cherry blossom trees were in full bloom, but the Awakened could see and hear us there.</p>
<p>We turned in the opposite direction and went into a hotel.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>With just three months remaining until the United States off-year election, the hotel had already implemented a targeted marketing strategy. They advertised a ‘Race to Congress’ package, priced at six hundred dollars per night, which included a variety of amenities and a tourist information brochure featuring attractions in Washington D.C. They also mentioned they would provide more discounts for media personnel.</p>
<p>“The hotelier here lacks discernment.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee briefly commented on the hotel service and asked about the most expensive package. The employee replied that there was the deluxe package worth about twenty thousand dollars per night, which included a top-class suite room, dinner personally cooked by the hotel’s executive chef, and various massages available at the hotel’s spa.</p>
<p>As the unnecessary explanation continued, the smile disappeared from Yeon-Hee’s face. She was unusually irritated with the hotel staff and showed an unwelcoming gaze toward other guests who had come to stay due to the hearing. It seemed that the criticism Jonathan had received during the hearing had been quite frustrating for her as well.</p>
<p>While Yeon-Hee was taking care of the check-in process, I was listening to the conversations of the other guests in the lobby. As I mentioned earlier, many of them were staying due to the hearing. Most of them appeared to be professionals working in media who were planning their own coverage in Washington, separate from the correspondents on the scene.</p>
<p>There was already interaction between them, and it was reasonable for the hotel staff to mistake us for journalists from Asia, as the majority here were reporters.</p>
<p>Anyway, the main point of their conversation was that they had set their reporting direction to be favorable towards Jonathan and the Jonathan Group. Of course, there were murmurs of astonishment and complaints that the reporting guidelines handed down from above were the same and that the Jonathan Group was already exerting pressure.</p>
<p>However, no one was indiscreetly talking loudly about such things. They were whispering secretly as if plotting something, rolling their eyes and quietly exchanging opinions among themselves.</p>
<p>By coincidence, a group of protestors was passing by the lobby’s front window. I wasn’t sure what the journalists would think when they saw them, but if they wanted to succeed in the media field, they had no choice but to follow the reporting guidelines from their bosses. No matter how open the world was through the Internet, public sentiment naturally swayed when major media outlets started to speak in unison.</p>
<p>The battle Jonathan was waging against the public had already begun. As the protestors swept through the street in front of the hotel and passed by, Yeon-Hee returned after paying the accommodation fee with her card.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Jonathan went that far, and they are still doing this?</p>
<p>The momentum of the protestors had clearly diminished. To be precise, the voices that supported Jonathan could now be heard.</p>
<p>Moreover, those voices would gain strength if the media got involved. It was a matter of broadening one’s perspective. Yeon-Hee knew about this, but she still grumbled. Anyway, we had other tasks at hand.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Are you not angry? Or are you holding back? Be honest.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee asked in the elevator going up to the room.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Honestly?</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Yes.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: I just feel sorry for Jonathan. He is bearing the burden that I should be carrying.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: I don’t know.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: It is not that we are wrong or the public is wrong for condemning us. Both sides think they are justified. In fact, in a situation where the truth is unknown, one could even say that there is justice for the public.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Why are you saying it like it is someone else’s business?</p>
<p>Then, she shook her phone. She showed me a missed call from a Korean number, saying it was a call from Seong-Il.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: We all think the same. You and Jonathan shouldn’t be treated like this. You understand that it is really hard for us, right? Although it is Jonathan who stands in court, in reality, it is no different than you standing there.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: But we cannot destroy humanity either.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: But…f𝔯e𝘦𝒘e𝑏𝙣𝑜𝚟𝚎l. co𝑚</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: It’s not ‘but.’ Woo Yeon-Hee, we must not forget what we have been trying to protect, even though we have left the Stage of Advent. If you have any intention of intervening in Jonathan’s work, forget it completely from this moment on.</p>
<p>There must have been a hint of aggression in my voice because Yeon-Hee’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Let’s leave the matter here to Jonathan. We should focus on our own tasks.</p>
<p>I held out the bone ring in front of her as I spoke. The bone ring had been reacting to the Life Vessel within her since early on.</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere has detected the Life Vessel.]</p>
<p>[Would you like to reset the Life Vessel?]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 410</p>
<p>We started as soon as we entered the room. There was no need to hesitate since I had confirmed Yeon-Hee’s thoughts on this again.</p>
<p>As the Life Vessel flowed out of Yeon-Hee’s body in a river of dark energy and was absorbed into the bone ring immediately after, she let out a short gasp of relief. It was a sense of liberation for her, who had been tied to the Life Vessel as a form of restriction.</p>
<p>Is it over?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee silently asked with her eyes. When I nodded, she asked with a complicated look, “Is it going to be Jonathan from now on?”</p>
<p>She was asking if I had plans to put the Life Vessel inside Jonathan’s body next. However, just having the Life Vessel could make him a target of the enemies. We still had not figured out what route Saint Dragorin was taking to attack the mainland. Although the number of their invaders had considerably reduced, they were still trying to mug us.</p>
<p>Jonathan was currently maintaining order on my behalf, so I couldn’t let him be disturbed by the Life Vessel. After watching the hearing, I had become convinced of that. Therefore, there was someone else who had to protect the Life Vessel.</p>
<p>“Orca.”</p>
<p>That was why I had brought it before returning.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee wished to discuss it further, but I was unable to engage in a long conversation as I hadn’t had the chance to take a proper shower upon returning to Washington D.C. I had only changed my clothes. I was exhausted from wandering around for seven days without even a moment of rest at the Saint Dragorin, and the fatigue from the last battle made me more restless.</p>
<p>“You must be really tired. Go sleep in your bed, not here…”</p>
<p>I heard Yeon-Hee’s worried voice faintly, and it had been quite some time. The tub was overflowing with hot water, causing it to spill out and fill the entire bathroom with steam. When I checked the time, it seemed like I had slept for about three hours.</p>
<p>When I came out wearing a gown and sat on the couch, Yeon-Hee was skillfully wielding the Clown’s Dagger after its final reinforcement.</p>
<p>She asked in a concerned voice, “Do you need to sleep more?”</p>
<p>I gently pulled her toward me, then she looked up at me with a smile as if she had been waiting for this. The intense look in her eyes from the hearing was no longer visible. I could feel a natural instinct creeping into her.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute. Hold on.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee slightly pushed me away and looked around. She came back after checking that the plastic bag on the table contained condoms. That was right. We still lived in a world where we were not supposed to have a baby between us.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Here is the first news. Jonathan Hunter, who had been hiding since the Awakened returned from the Stage of Advent, appeared at the hearing yesterday and declared that his only concern was humanity’s safety. Amid growing concerns about the transcendent being that had been discovered around June 2nd, the Jonathan Investment Finance Group reaffirmed its commitment to be a ‘defender’ in any crisis situation.</p>
<p>To prove his sincerity, he revealed that he is the mysterious major shareholder ‘John Doe’ of the Jonathan Group. He also claimed that he would accept the judiciary’s decision regarding the anonymous transactions he made.</p>
<p>With Jonathan Hunter’s consistent message, the protests that had been spreading from Wall Street to countries around the world seem to be losing momentum.</p>
<p>The second news is about another alien attack in Manchester, United Kingdom, where fifteen Awakened and thirty civilian agents, as well as many employees of the TMC Group, lost their lives.</p>
<p>The buildings and their surroundings were suddenly covered in a blue veil, and cars on the road sped up to escape. A supernatural attack phenomenon, called ‘Blue Veil’ occurred at the TMC Group’s headquarters and training grounds.</p>
<p>There was a significant number of losses as most of the group’s Awakened were in outer space. We will connect to the reporter Curry Brown who is in Manchester. Hello, Curry.”</p>
<p>“On the 25th, local time, the Awakened and civilian agents who were preparing to enter outer space at the TMC Group’s headquarters fought against alien attackers. The battle lasted for two hours, and the loud noises from inside did not stop until the Blue Veil disappeared. Witnesses said that drivers in vehicles and pedestrians were terrified and were evacuated due to the noise.</p>
<p>The invasion had destroyed the group’s several facilities, including the strategic headquarters and training grounds, and resulted in more than one hundred casualties, including Awakened.</p>
<p>At the joint press conference in the World Awakened Association London Branch, TMC Group announced that they had repelled all alien attackers on-site and reminded that humanity is still not completely safe as long as such invasions continue to occur worldwide. They also emphasized that everyone should be prepared for the possibility of sudden increases in the frequency and intensity of attacks…”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was already awake. As the sound of the television she had turned on became clearer, the weight of her body leaning against my chest also became more distinct. I didn’t open my eyes because I was savoring the moment.</p>
<p>Shortly after, she moved a bit, then the television was turned off.</p>
<p>“Sorry, did I wake you up?” she asked apologetically.</p>
<p>I answered with my eyes still closed, “What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Around eight o’clock.”</p>
<p>I nodded. “Let’s stay like this for a little longer.”</p>
<p>I had already woken up from the sound of the news, but this wasn’t bad. The love we shared last night still lingered through the skin that was in contact with hers. Her small shoulders, small enough to hold with my one hand, especially reminded me of last night.</p>
<p>As I lay stroking her shoulder for about an hour, I felt it was time to start the day.</p>
<p>We showered and dressed together, then I began to unfold the stories I had put off from telling yesterday. Yeon-Hee had been waiting to listen to them as well. It was a story of searching for the two Dragorins by visiting each Holy Knight in the Greenwood Continent. Most of them didn’t even notice that I was there.</p>
<p>The ones who were blood descendants of the Greats all had the ability to awaken as soon as a Doom was near. Even if they didn’t directly face me, they would awaken as soon as I entered their vicinity. In fact, Dragorin Blue and Green both showed signs of awakening as soon as I approached them.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee couldn’t help but laugh when she heard that the places where I had caught them were battlefields where they were fighting.</p>
<p>The Greenwood Continent was still in the midst of a conquest war that was dominated by powerful countries to confront the Demon King’s corps. In other words, they were fighting each other on the pretext of strengthening their own military forces before the Demon King’s army attacked their territory.</p>
<p>They seemed to be sincere with their goals. The powerful countries of Greenwood believed it was more rational to conquer their neighboring countries under their flag than to build alliances with them.</p>
<p>Despite the vastness of the North, East, South, and West, the fact that all the powerful countries had reached a unanimous conclusion despite the communication barriers caused by the immense size of the land meant something. It was not because they were all stupid.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee chuckled while buttoning up her blouse. “Their way of thinking is so similar to humans. It is actually the same.”</p>
<p>We dressed up and headed to the association’s headquarters. Both of our returning stones’ destinations were set there, so we moved immediately. As the energy dispersed through space, the background changed quickly from a hotel room in Washington D.C. with morning sunlight to the office of the headquarters locked at night.</p>
<p>I could see Orca’s suite between the bright lights beyond the window. There, the tentacles that had lost their master and hung limp had regained their vitality and wriggled on their own. Even in the middle of the night, the association agents were controlling access in front of Orca’s building. Yeon-Hee brought her Kciphos in her arms, then headed toward Orca.</p>
<p>Orca’s throne was located on the top of the building, and it greeted us after coming down from its throne, which was made of tentacles and the unique clay of the Maruka Clan.</p>
<p>Orca had once failed to protect the Life Vessel of the Maruka Clan in the past, but it was now completely different from before. Yeon-Hee quickly noticed that it had become stronger than before. Although it still appeared injured, the immense power that had grown after swallowing Insectum’s subordinate couldn’t be hidden even if it wanted to.</p>
<p>When Insectum and I were summoned to the meeting of the Demon Kings and vanished, Orca had fought a life-or-death battle against Insectum’s subordinates. Then, it waited for me there.</p>
<p>“Amazing, Orca!”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee raised her voice. It was more a joyful voice than a cautious one. She was calming down the Kciphos, who was baring its teeth at Orca.</p>
<p>Orca had become so strong that it could suppress the instincts of its illegitimate children. Yeon-Hee was more surprised by that. Originally, the low-class Maruka Clan instantly attacked us as soon as they saw us due to their primitive hostility towards different species.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they were silent now. They were just swarming around Orca’s throne without moving a muscle even though they were aware of our presence.</p>
<p>At that time, I found a large egg on the side. Inside the translucent membrane of the egg, a bipedal Maruka was about to be born. Orca was giving birth to a real kid that could think like itself and not a low-class illegitimate offspring. It intended to build a perfect territory of its own, starting with that new baby.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and I were very careful with contraception, but it was doing whatever it wanted.</p>
<p>“If you feel cramped, then I will give you a new territory, Orca.”</p>
<p>There was no need for it to stay within the association if its job was to protect my Life Vessel. There were plenty of lands suitable for it to rule as the king of its own faction, including deserted islands and vast wastelands.</p>
<p>However, it seemed that the building was enough. Soon, Orca expressed its refusal in its awkward Korean. Well…the size of this entire building was equivalent to ten times larger than Walt Disney’s Concert Hall. Thousands of ready-mix concrete trucks had been used to build just this one building.</p>
<p>“Okay, fine,” I said as I felt the energy clinging to the bone ring. “There is something you have to protect.”</p>
<p>Orca seemed to have an intuition about what I was talking about. It had once guarded the Life Vessel with the original species of Maruka, which had created it.</p>
<p>[Life Vessel has been reset.]</p>
<p>[Target: Orca]</p>
<p>“And that means you also need to protect your own life.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 411</p>
<p>Excavation of remains, the meeting of the Demon Kings, and Dragorin hunting… A series of events occurred before I could finish studying Mana.</p>
<p>As a result, I was promoted one level to rank five in the Doom hierarchy, obtained the bone ring, and raised my Power figure to over five hundred. My Power Resistance increased to sixty percent when I wore both Ra’s Sun Cape and the bone ring. I could expect higher figures if my trait Passion, which was reinforced by the Man Who Overcomes Adversity, reached Level 8 or higher, but…</p>
<p>As expected, multiple methods were needed to become stronger all at once. First, I needed to study Mana and used it as a foundation to increase my Power figure. I had to reach a level where I could handle it freely of my will.</p>
<p>Second, I had to unlock the unique power of Doom Entegasto’s ‘King of the Dead’ and the ability possessed by Half of the Great Red’s Heart contained in the bone ring. Third, I needed to continue retrieving the remaining powers from the old War of New Devil.</p>
<p>The problem was Lunea. Ever since it had entered the world of Demon Kings as the messenger of Doom Kaos, it had been trying to restrict my actions. Well…it wasn’t physical pressure, but of course, it was definitely sending messages on behalf of Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>[I will tell you again. I respect that you have defeated two Dragorins, but you might ruin the overall command. It was fortunate that it was Blue and Green. Attacking the Red Dragorin without understanding the queen’s true nature could have been very dangerous. Don’t ask me why because I, Lunea, don’t know. Just accept what I’m telling you. That’s not hard.</p>
<p>It was the same now, too. Although I wanted to snap at it that I would have avoided the battle if Dragorin Red was among the two I had discovered, the conversation between us was all one-sided.</p>
<p>[By the way, how long will you stay on the mainland? It has already been a day. Haven’t you rested enough? (•́д•̀) Lazy… Ah! I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have said that out loud, oopsy! It is just a mistake as I’m not used to this way of communication. You understand, right?]</p>
<p>It was a psychological attack. I wasn’t pissed even when the widespread protests took place, but my face unconsciously stiffened when the messages from Lunea came in.</p>
<p>After placing my Life Vessel inside Orca, Yeon-Hee entered as she had returned from doing some personal things. She had changed out of business attire to more comfortable clothes.</p>
<p>She said to my hardened face, “You are still worried about the protests, right? You don’t need to hold back in front of me.”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, it’s because of Lunea.”</p>
<p>When I briefly explained the situation, her expression became serious as well. However, she couldn’t provide a solution. Just as Jonathan was carrying out my will, Lunea was delivering Doom Kaos’s will through its own impertinent interpretation. I could remove Lunea to stop it, but then, another execution would take place in the meeting of Dooms.</p>
<p>I couldn’t approach Lunea like I did with Caso.</p>
<p>“I think…umm. It would be better not to delay Doom… Kaos’s orders any longer. I will help you up to that point.”</p>
<p>Even before Yeon-Hee suggested the idea, I was already planning to do that. As long as I was under Doom Kaos, I couldn’t test its patience. The fact that Doom Entegasto had executed Insectum had implications for me as well. I had to hide my claws until I had the power to confront them.</p>
<p>I shifted my gaze toward the tablet PC. The program used by the association’s integrated situation room was running, and the monitor was displaying a world map of Saint Dragorin that was made based on the Awakened’s information.</p>
<p>The Greenwood Continent was where creatures that resembled us were living, and the Elsland Continent was the habitat of the elves and the stronghold of the Lacryma Order. In addition, the Seven Demon Kings’ lands, also known as the Continent of Death, where orcs and dwarves lived, were stretched out across the sea.</p>
<p>When Yeon-Hee touched the Greenwood Continent, the map zoomed in and showed the occupied areas in red. A phrase [Greenwood Occupation Rate: 9.2%] appeared on the top.</p>
<p>“You are looking for the priest who received the direct appointment from the Queen of Elsland, right?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was carefully observing the surroundings of the Lacryma Altar. They were marked with the locations of the Holy Knight families, the estimated positions of each dungeon, and other key points based on the information gathered by the Awakened.</p>
<p>“The command comes with a clue. Although it is a malicious order that makes me kill the Queen of Elsland if she is deemed ‘The Great,’ Doom Kaos believes that she is not ‘The Great.’ In order to approach her safely, we would need to find the priests who have directly received appointments from the queen. If we want to take a more aggressive approach, then we should find an elf slave who had lived in the court of Elsland.”</p>
<p>Then, I scrolled down and zoomed into the castle in Elsland.</p>
<p>It was different from the Greenwood Continent, which was densely marked with dozens of symbols. There was very little known information. Moreover, the most noticeable point was that not a single dungeon led directly into Elsland. I had suspected that the Old One’s protection would be strong in Elsland ever since the situation room program was completed.</p>
<p>I told Yeon-Hee to move a bit away from me and tested my theory out immediately.</p>
<p>[You have activated Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>The destination was the southern part of Elsland, which was the furthest away I could go from the castle.</p>
<p>The space had to be torn open, creating a black void. However, it stopped with a slight movement in the air.</p>
<p>[Time left until Gate Formation: 6 days 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds]</p>
<p>[* The power of the Old One pervading Elsland is interfering with the activation.]</p>
<p>As expected…</p>
<p>[Warning: Among the Holy Knights of Elsland, someone has detected the Gate Formation. Keep this in mind when entering.]</p>
<p>The options disappeared, and now I had no choice but to find the priest who was directly appointed by the queen within Greenwood. Then, the problem was deciding where to create the Gate, and I decided that it would be best to support the central part of Greenwood, where the Awakened were fighting.</p>
<p>Only the Barien Empire was under our control. Whether the armies of the countries around the empire were running away or continuing to advance to reclaim the empire’s land, there were numerous battles for the Awakened to fight.</p>
<p>By defeating them and devouring the Kingdom of Atres, another powerful nation in the central region, it would be safe to say that we had conquered the central part of the Greenwood Continent. What would happen after occupying the central region? From then on, we would be ready to advance in any direction.</p>
<p>[You have canceled Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>I picked up the phone and called Lee Tae-Han to ask if there were any corps of the surrounding countries of the Barien Empire that were moving with the Lacryma denomination.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was night there too. The time the gate opened and closed was so short that no one noticed us entering. The sight of the front was reflected in Yeon-Hee’s calm eyes. The neighboring nation of the Barien Empire’s corpses were billeted in the vast plains.</p>
<p>As Lee Tae-Han had mentioned, we could find the flags of the Lacryma alongside the nations’ flags. In addition, it appeared that the Awakened were watching them nearby, as drones were hidden in the night sky. Yeon-Hee had been looking forward, but she then followed my gaze toward the sky and shifted back at me.</p>
<p>She asked while being conscious of the drone, “I don’t think we need to call it?”</p>
<p>No one here besides us was aware of the drone.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand-Year-Old Spider has been removed.]</p>
<p>A huge figure with red eyes appeared, looking down at us. Yeon-Hee looked up at the spider with the same gaze she had when she had seen the strengthened Orca, then put the Kciphos down on the ground.</p>
<p>When I nodded, Yeon-Hee pulled out the Clown’s Dagger and wrapped it around her hand. However, it was Kciphos, who had been quietly nestled in Yeon-Hee’s arms, who rushed towards the altar before us. It quickly changed like a Holy Knight awakening as a Dragorin. It drew a trajectory with its red, madness-filled eyes, and the spider hid its trace underground.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee and I exchanged looks and headed in the opposite direction. The screams that burst out from the Kciphos and the vibrations caused by the movement of the spider underground broke the silence of the night at once. A crackling noise came from the entire area. Right then, magical spheres, which illuminated the night like daylight, soared up.</p>
<p>“K…Kciphos- It’s Kciphos!”</p>
<p>The Demon King, whom they had been talking about, had appeared in person.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Ethereal Animal.]</p>
<p>I flew into the sky, scattering sparks. Then, I turned toward what I assumed to be the commander’s tent. There were no attacks on me until I entered the barrack as I burned the roof.</p>
<p>Neither Yeon-Hee nor I enjoyed the smell of blood like the Kciphos did. They were just enemies, and I was always willing to stop if they showed their willingness to submit and their intention to join my human corps.</p>
<p>There were priests and wizards, but none of their projectiles and magic spells matched the speed at which I flew to the tent. All sorts of noise began to mix from the distance. The sound of Yeon-Hee’s dagger slicing through the wind, the Kciphos stamping on the ground, and the spider spewing flames. Of course, countless screams accompanied them.</p>
<p>Also, in front of me… Saaaak-</p>
<p>The commander confronted me right after arming himself, only to have his throat cut and his fragile barrier shattered like glass. At the moment when I collected the spoils from him, the entire barracks had been burned down.</p>
<p>Although I was titled as ‘Demon King,’ I wanted them to realize that I wasn’t an evil being that thirsted for blood like they had imagined. I threw spoils at the feet of another individual who was in a leadership position. In my mind, my intentions had been made clear.</p>
<p>However, it was true that one commander’s spoils wouldn’t make the entire corps kneel. There were magic spells rushing toward me, and I heard the sound of them calling more soldiers and knights.</p>
<p>Out-of-control phenomena began to fly toward me. Transcendental beings could only be confronted by their similar kinds. If they couldn’t prepare countermeasures, then begging for mercy to spare their lives was a wiser choice. It was time to teach them the obvious fact.</p>
<p>[You have used Devi’s Sword.]</p>
<p>I manipulated it such that it collected all their necks and jumped into them. I would be soaked in blood again, but I was used to it.</p>
<p>Right then, Lunea’s message appeared before my eyes. Ugh… again…</p>
<p>[Wow, I have been waiting for your return. I, Lunea, feel rewarded for my hard work.]</p>
<p>I get it, so shut the fuck up.</p>
<p>Just as I didn’t test the patience of Doom Kaos, it would better not test mine. I was so ready to break into its mainland and kill every single creature there.</p>
<p>[But do you know that? I forgot to tell you earlier, but I can’t delay it any longer. I collected the first volume of the Book of Death back then. If you allow me, then I will use it very well. You took my light, so it’s fair, right?]</p>
<p>The emotions that surged up made my vision blurry.</p>
<p>[Our master also wishes that. Then I will take it as permission and gratefully accept it~ ٩(๑☉ᴗ☉)۶ ]</p>
<p>This motherfucker is….really crazy.</p>
<p>[Surely you are not angry. Anyway, as a token of gratitude, I will tell you what I have learned so far. I was debating whether or not to teach you this, but alright. I, Lunea, always repay what I receive. Listen carefully, Doom Man. I think some of the Old One’s soldiers…have succeeded in infiltrating your mainland.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 412</p>
<p>The body of the soldier in the Demon King Corps that he initially stole was not very strong. He would have preferred to get a stronger body as his first transfer target, but this was the best he could find as it was impossible to find a better one.</p>
<p>Although it was difficult to control the body due to the injuries left in the target, there was something he had to do. He needed to retrieve the sacred object of Lord Lacryma, the Soul Ring. It had originally been on the finger of his actual body.</p>
<p>His dead body lay at the feet of the body he transferred to, but he couldn’t afford to be immersed in emotions as the situation was urgent. He quickly retrieved the Soul Ring from his old body and collapsed. At the same time, the memories of the transferred target were flooding in like a torrent.</p>
<p>“Mr. Samuel, can you hear my voice?”</p>
<p>Samuel’s brow twitched. He could now understand the language of the Demon King Corps and knew who was talking to him through the memories. He naturally thought of the answer to the question in their language, and the terminology for the knights who fought alongside him on the battlefield before his actual self died also came to his mind in their language.</p>
<p>In their mainland, they called the knights, his old comrades, ‘invaders from outer space.’</p>
<p>Samuel asked, “What happened to the attackers? No one must have…survived.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct, sir.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I want to be alone now.”</p>
<p>“The situation with the TMC Group has become complicated due to the previous invasion. I have something important to tell you about that matter…”</p>
<p>“Later.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>As soon as the door closed, Samuel closed his eyes again and carefully went through the memories of the owner of the body. Astonishment began to appear vividly on his twitching brows.</p>
<p>The memories could be divided into three sections. The period before the Stage of Advent, the Stage of Advent, and moments after returning from the stage. In particular, the memories at the stage were full of incomprehensible facts. They were scenes of fighting with evil beings like Baclan and Declan for decades, but he couldn’t understand a thing.</p>
<p>Isn’t this the Doom Man’s dimension..?</p>
<p>However, Doom Man’s soldiers had been fighting against the soldiers of other Demon Kings in the Stage of Advent and periods decades before that. Even now, the owner of the body still considered the other Demon King’s soldiers, monsters like Declan and Baclan, as enemies that must be killed along with the creations of Lord Lacryma, his original self, and his loved ones.</p>
<p>Moreover, the day when the monsters attacked Doom Man’s dimension was called the ‘Day of Advent’ here. Just by looking at the memories, all kinds of circumstances were full of inconsistencies.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the incident at the end of the Final Stage appeared to have impressed the owner of the body so much that his memory was incredibly vivid. Even with all the Awakened gathered, they couldn’t confront Odin.</p>
<p>Odin was the only Awakened who had reached the Ender section and had absorbed the malice of Doom Kaos into his own body. He ranked first in the hierarchy. Even the King of Hell, Jonathan Hunter, who held the majority of the wealth in the entire world, was considered lower than Odin.</p>
<p>Odin was indeed at the top of the World Awakened Association, which governed the Awakened. However, he was not notorious in the civilian world.</p>
<p>What kind of world is this..?</p>
<p>Samuel was utterly confused. The world of Doom Man seen outside the memories of the body was completely different from the world he had imagined. While he knew that the Demon Corps formed a civilization as a group, he thought their world would have been dominated by an absolute evil power.</p>
<p>If there were a lower-class group, then he imagined them as naked slaves engaged only in production and labor activities for the corps. Nonetheless, this was a world where the King of Hell Jonathan Hunter was standing in the trial himself, for a reason that didn’t even seem to be valid.</p>
<p>Samuel immediately searched for the remote control as soon as he opened his eyes. He turned on the television. As expected, it was noisy with the news of Jonathan Hunter standing in a trial. The news was also broadcasting countless images of the protestors on the streets.</p>
<p>None of the rulers in Greenwood Continent could be compared to Jonathan Hunter’s power, wealth, and the influence he exerted. However, such a person was standing trial for the lower-class citizens.</p>
<p>Prior to that, political ideologies such as democracy and communism had already emerged in the world, which focused on the lower-class citizens. However, with the return of the Awakened from the stage, it was expected to revert to absolutism.</p>
<p>Samuel couldn’t take his eyes off the television as he was shocked. The shock was tremendous enough to momentarily make him forget the main purpose of entering the mainland of Doom Man. He shook his head violently.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Eventually, Samuel came to one conclusion. The reason why this place hadn’t changed much before and after the Day of Advent was because of the unity in their command, as shown by the King of Hell in the hearing.</p>
<p>Odin and his close aides, the board members of the association, were creating the current world together. While they kept the lower-class, which filled the majority of the association, here, they sent trained agents to Saint Dragorin, the precious world that Lord Lacryma created.</p>
<p>The fact that Doom Man, who fought against the Demon King Corps, had joined their ranks was of lesser importance. As emphasized by the King of Hell during the hearing, what truly mattered was the present reality. The reality of the Awakened that were steadily flowing into Star Dragorin!</p>
<p>If Samuel could keep their ambitions focused on their mainland, rather than Star Dragorin… If he could plunge the entire mainland of Doom Man into civil war or disrupt the world’s order…</p>
<p>It would be the most significant blow that could defeat the Demon Corps. Thus, there was no need to choose an Awakened as the next transfer target because they were already excluded from the power structure of the world.</p>
<p>In fact, there were multiple cases where the power of those with money surpassed that of the Awakened. Many Awakened were operating under the name of capital forces, and the owner of the body was also tied to an agent.</p>
<p>Samuel obtained a laptop through his subordinate after thinking that far. It was time to search for the next transfer target. It would have been great if he could seize the body of the King of Hell, but that was simply a long-term goal for now.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Samuel came across a conspiracy theory during his search for a target. The idea had existed even before the Day of Advent. It was about a shadow government of elites that had gathered to rule the world, and its name was the Bilderberg Club.</p>
<p>Although it was treated as civilian gossip like UFOs, occult horror stories, or moon landing conspiracies, it was hard to say that it was false. On the days and places where the club meeting was held, protestors set up a camp in the front while famous capitalists and powerful officials secretly gathered at the venue.</p>
<p>Samuel became interested. If the Bilderberg Club actually existed, infiltrating it would be his short term goal. Even if the club ended up being just a conspiracy theory, he could take over the body of someone influential in this world to exert more power. After all, he would be chased by the Security Bureau as an unregistered Awakened committing acts of violence in a guerrilla-like violence in his current body.</p>
<p>Anyway, the people presumed to be members of the club had unbelievable influence. There were some like Jonathan Hunter and Joshua von Karjan who had become Awakened, but it would be easier to use the body of a non-Awakened to approach Sword Master-level individuals instead of directly using their bodies. Samuel stayed up all night to identify the next target.</p>
<p>On the next day, Samuel planned to change to a stronger physical form at least up to the diamond section to proceed with the plan as capitalists, politicians, and other influential people often had Awakened as bodyguards.</p>
<p>Also, it was easy to assess the Awakened strength as their rank was publicly accessible. Transferring to a much stronger target would inherently carry risks, so he had to move himself to the subject as if he was climbing up the stairs.</p>
<p>Samuel walked out of the hospital room. Someone called him from the back, but he maintained a fast pace until he reached the crowd. Another capitalist group’s headquarters was located not far away, and an Awakened who had a deep connection with the owner of the current body from the stage was waiting for the entry to outer space.</p>
<p>His level was only one digit higher than the current body, so he was a perfect fit for the next target.</p>
<p>“I came to see Mark. If you say Samuel is here, then he will know who I am.”</p>
<p>Samuel spoke to the receptionist in the lobby and waited on the couch. Large monitors were displaying today’s item prices and the latest news from the association in the center. The news was covering the damage to the TMC Group that he used to belong to.</p>
<p>As Samuel stared at them for a while, a bulky man appeared in the hallway. When he looked at Samuel’s face, surprise spread on his face.</p>
<p>“The TMC healers must be skilled. Can you walk around already?”</p>
<p>Samuel quipped, “Hey, you didn’t even visit me. How dare you! Haha.”</p>
<p>“Haha, I was busy. Anyway, what’s up?”</p>
<p>“I need an appraisal from a third perspective. As you know, the situation in my group is horrible.”</p>
<p>Samuel showed the Soul Ring on his finger.</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“A drop item. The leader of the attackers had it.”</p>
<p>“Elf? Dwarf? Or the Greenwood species?”</p>
<p>“...I need you. Follow me.”</p>
<p>Samuel stood up, and thought about the quiet places where people didn’t go from the body’s memory. There was a space between buildings where Manchester’s gangs used as escapades. Well…they all disappeared when the Awakened Group’s headquarters entered the street.</p>
<p>When they arrived there, Samuel showed his ring without a word again.</p>
<p>“I can be a dummy, but what am I getting from this?”</p>
<p>The man shrugged, and Samuel answered.</p>
<p>“I have prepared some compensation.”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah?”</p>
<p>“You have gone through a lot at the Stage of Advent, Mark. It’s time for you to rest.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Once your soul is extinguished, you probably won’t feel any pain.”</p>
<p>“What the hell…?”</p>
<p>A cold energy filled Samuel's eyes, and a sinister energy radiated simultaneously from the Soul Ring.</p>
<p>Then, the man who became Mark from Samuel went out to find another target. After all, the current body he had changed into was just a temporary vessel. His final goal was occupying the body of a member of the Bilderberg Club.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 413</p>
<p>There had been a total of twenty-three alien attacks in the past two and a half months since the Awakened returned. They occurred every two days on average and typically consisted of around ten monsters.</p>
<p>The target of these invasions was obviously the headquarters of the Awakened, never deviating from this pattern. It was the same for the attack in Manchester on the 25th.</p>
<p>However, this attack took place in the wealthy neighborhood of Rumson, New Jersey, at Jonathan’s mansion. When Jonathan sensed the invasion, he recalled the message he had received from Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>He didn’t know how or why his mansion became the next target, but it appeared to be related to the infiltrating soldiers from Old One on the mainland. The change in the pattern of attacks, happening the day after he received the message, made it seem less likely to be a coincidence. He had never imagined this would happen in his mansion.</p>
<p>Jonathan could feel the presence of the seven attackers while checking the blue barrier outside his window. Then, he heard the sound immediately.</p>
<p>Pow. Pow. Pow pow pow-</p>
<p>The security guards of the mansion started firing the rifles, and the smell of gunpowder filled his nostrils.</p>
<p>“This is perfect timing.”</p>
<p>His eyes flashed red in the direction of the battle. He had been holding back his anger from the protests, so his counterattack was filled with personal emotion. Every time he crushed the heads of the already incapacitated attackers, a sharp-tempered laugh escaped from him.</p>
<p>In the end, there was only one alien left, an elf who had not participated in the battle and simply watched as his fellows died. It was hard to tell if the last one was the same species with other attackers because while others were all species from the Greenwood continent, this one was an elf with pointy ears.</p>
<p>However, they could be considered one group due to their uniforms. All the previous attackers wore the battle gear of the Lacryma Order, and this male elf was no exception. As the elf turned, the battle gear underneath his armor fluttered, and a dazzling light flashed. There was undoubtedly an effect imbued in its gear unlike others.</p>
<p>Jonathan heard that Sun could still read the messages, but he couldn’t. Nonetheless, he could roughly guess what it was - a negative effect, Glaciation, a powerful binding force like that of an S-class insignia.</p>
<p>This force shot up vertically from where the elf was standing, quelling the flames of the King of Hell and freezing Jonathan’s ankles. Not only was the effect powerful, but the elf’s agility in escaping into the garden was also impressive.</p>
<p>At that moment, Jonathan’s face contorted in anger. The elf never intended to fight him in the first place, considering how it simply scouted his abilities and quickly retreated.</p>
<p>When Jonathan finally broke free from the binding and shattered the ice, the elf had already disappeared, and the Blue Veil was gone now.</p>
<p>All that was left were the corpses of the Greenwood species attackers and the security guards caught in the initial battle. However, they were not intact, as most of the bodies had lost their shape in the flames consuming the mansion. The mansion collapsed entirely as the sound of sirens approached.</p>
<p>It was easy to find a new place to live, but he couldn’t help but stare at the ashes of his mansion primarily because he was shocked that the aliens had specified him as a target and attacked.</p>
<p>The fact that the leader, who possessed a power level comparable to that of an Awakened in the challenger section, appeared, observed him covertly, and then fled, indicated…that the Old One had begun assessing the situation on the mainland.</p>
<p>Then, Kim Cheong-Soo pushed through the crowd and rushed to Jonathan. Despite Jonathan’s blood-stained and fierce expression, Kim Cheong-Soo brought his face close to him. The other man's breath was unusually heavy.</p>
<p>He whispered in Jonathan’s ear, “Daniel is saying something strange.”</p>
<p>Daniel was one of the knights of the financial empire that Seon-Hu had personally hired. He managed Gold and Silver Investment and was based in The City of London like Gillian. He was leading the fourth domain, following the Jonathan Group, Gillian Group, and Telestar Investment.</p>
<p>Although his range of responsibilities wasn’t as wide as Jessica’s, there was no doubt that he was one of the key figures in the financial empire.</p>
<p>Jonathan raised his voice slightly, “Something strange?”</p>
<p>“Daniel claims that he is not Daniel.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The first thing Daniel did after taking over his current body was to deliver the information he had gathered and the warnings to the Lacryma Order. It wasn’t a difficult task. He just needed to concentrate his memories on the sacred artifact of the church he had brought along with the Soul Ring, then threw it into Dragorin, which then naturally flowed into Elsland.</p>
<p>The science and technology of this world was indeed impressive, but doing something like this was impossible even here. Also, as the owner of this body was a person of Odin's, so he couldn’t afford the timing to throw the artifact into Dragorin as he was with other Odin’s people all the time.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Breaking news. A Blue Veil phenomenon has been discovered at Jonathan Hunter’s residence…”</p>
<p>Why did they send me if this was going to happen…</p>
<p>Daniel’s face collapsed as he watched the television with a frustrated expression. The sense of despair he felt was more terrible than he had anticipated. Despite his earnest warnings, the church still sent an expedition team to the King of Hell.</p>
<p>I, for sure, warned them that sending an expedition to him would actually help him! What is wrong with them?</p>
<p>Daniel felt as if the rotten smell of the palace had spread here. The queen was indulging in pleasure with the young Kanonas, and the entire court was full of veiled enmities, which ultimately prevented his warning from reaching the queen’s ears. It was foolish to expect that even a little change would occur if the palace learned how perfectly and benevolently the Doom Man ruled his own world.</p>
<p>This is why I hesitated until the end…</p>
<p>Tik!</p>
<p>The hand that pressed the remote control button with a weak gesture had no strength in it. However, he realized that threatening thoughts were sprouting in his mind, then widened his eyes.</p>
<p>He thought…if Odin, Doom Man, ruled Elsland as he ruled his own world, it would be great. The Doom Man was an ideal emperor, although he was titled as a Demon King. People here weren’t aware of it, so they were protesting. However, that was the world that Doom Man wanted, a place where people could voice their opinions.</p>
<p>Anyway, Doom Man’s actions had been consistently noble before and after the Stage of Advent, as well as during the decades that followed. He could have dictated his world oppressively, but he chose not to as he didn’t wish to have blood splattering everywhere here.</p>
<p>That was why he placed the dangerous Awakened into the capitalist world and sent them to Dragorin. This made Daniel more confused. The memories of the bodies he had been in didn’t explain why Odin had joined the Demon Kings. There were stories about Odin taking in the malice that had resided in the system, but did something happen at that point?</p>
<p>Daniel shifted his gaze back to his phone. He felt like the King of Hell, Jonathan Hunter, who had worked with Odin for a long time, would be able to resolve his burning curiosity. He was the closest confidant of Odin. Seeing that Jonathan had received full authority over the club by Odin and was standing on his behalf proved that he knew a lot about Odin.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the moment he contacted the King of Hell, things would become irreversible. It was an act of abandoning his lord, Lacryma. Suddenly, Daniel felt like the Soul Ring was cursed as he had learned something he didn’t need to know.</p>
<p>From the moment Daniel’s thoughts reached that point, his hand began to tremble nervously. Even when most of the club members foresaw the current protests and insisted on reviving Project Teserra, Odin silenced them.</p>
<p>Daniel’s chest ached as he recalled Odin at that time. The pain felt like angina, and his heart raced uncontrollably with guilt, as if he had insulted Lord Lacryma.</p>
<p>However, it was probably because he had already made up his mind. Nothing could stop Daniel. Before he knew it, he was searching for Brian Kim in his phone contacts because the King of Hell was confronting the Lacryma’s worshippers at the battlefield.</p>
<p>&lt;Brian Kim: Daniel?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: I need to hear an answer from the King of Hell.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Brian Kim: That is pretty rude because the King of Hell is dealing with an attack right now…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: There is nothing to worry about that.&gt;</p>
<p>No one in this world knew that Odin was Doom Man. It appeared that Odin was hiding it, so Daniel didn’t bother asking Kim Cheong-Soo if he was aware of the fact.</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: Please let the King of Hell know that I am waiting for a response.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Brain Kim: Daniel, hey! Are you out of your mind?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: Maybe I am. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have contacted you in the first place.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Brian Kim: …Daniel… What is going on?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: I am not Daniel. The Daniel you knew is gone. Please deliver my words to King of Hell, Brian.&gt;</p>
<p>Daniel continued while fiddling with the Soul Ring.</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: I am from Elsland, Dragorin.&gt;</p>
<p>For the few minutes after hanging up the call while he was waiting for a reply, Daniel doubted his decision several times. However, his mind remained unchanged as he felt that this was worth risking his life for.</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: You said you came from Elsland, right?&gt;</p>
<p>The call started with a question, and Daniel started explaining over the phone.</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: Tell me the truth, and if that truth aligns with my intentions, I am willing to turn to your side.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Who are you, then?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Daniel: My name is Aslan. Call me Aslan.&gt;</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 414</p>
<p>It appeared that the bodies of the Barien Empire’s royal family, which had been hanging in the square, had been overrun with flies for an extended period. The swarm of flies briefly took flight when the townspeople approached to spit on the bodies, then settled back on them. They were the only ones that wanted to touch the emperor and his family’s flesh.</p>
<p>It was no wonder that most of the nobles who had been associated with the emperor had been purged. Gunshots could be heard from the direction of the imperial palace as the purge was still ongoing.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was standing in front of the gallows. To be exact, she was in front of the bulletin board, where the emperor and his followers’ evil deeds were listed for all passersby to see. Photos that depicted horrifying scenes of people dying in underground dungeons and scenes of the emperor’s debauchery at his lavish parties were attached as well.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee returned with a sneer as she looked at a poster on the back wall.</p>
<p>「 “The Liberation Army has arrived.”</p>
<p>― The Great Caliber, Emperor Slayer 」</p>
<p>It was Seong-Il, who was displayed stepping on the emperor’s back and stretching out his hand toward the people. The emperor was portrayed grotesquely as if he was in the process of decaying. Such posters filled with propaganda slogans could be found everywhere.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked around, including the direction where the poor were lined up for the distribution of food, then sat down next to me, stretching. She enjoyed the warm sunlight on her face, as the climate in Elsland was cool, which she loved.</p>
<p>“What do you want to do? Look for more dead? We have already done it three times, though.”</p>
<p>She spoke after the city guards saluted us as they passed by. She seemed to think that it wasn’t a wise approach, even before I nodded. Her tone of voice suggested that, and it was what we had worried about.</p>
<p>The information we could obtain through the priest who had received a direct appointment from the queen was extremely limited. The priest had little contact with the elves even after entering Elsland. Most of his time was spent with the Greenwood species who had accompanied him on the journey, and he hadn’t been free during the two days he had stayed at the palace.</p>
<p>In his memory, most of the court’s spaces were blacked out and covered in mystery as he had never seen or heard most of them. Of course, there was not much time to face the queen, so the only memorable thing about her was her decadent gaze.</p>
<p>“Others would be the same.”</p>
<p>In the Greenwood Continent, elves and orcs were extremely rare. Most of the species there were only aware that other species existed in the same world, but most of them ended their lives without ever seeing one of them.</p>
<p>There was no reason for different kinds like elves and dwarves to enter the continent. Only aggressive and greedy creatures like the red-faced orc tribes would enter in search of Old One’s relics. Therefore, it would be a waste of time for us to search for an elf who had been close to the queen. In other words, we had to take a risk and set foot on Elsland…</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to see you again, Odin. I received a report that you have arrived. I hope I am not bothering you.”</p>
<p>The person speaking was Hera, Deborah Bellucci. She seemed to have heard about the story as she appeared wearing not only the artifacts of Dragorin, but also her Awakened items.</p>
<p>For a moment, I strongly sensed that she was conscious of Yeon-Hee, and her weight distribution was also biased towards one foot, allowing her to escape from dangerous creatures at any time.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee also realized that, so she spoke with a slightly upset tone.</p>
<p>“I want to be friends with you, but I guess you don’t, Hera.”</p>
<p>Hera lowered her head and shook her hands as if to say that wasn’t true.</p>
<p>“What brought you here?” I asked.</p>
<p>She responded, “Have you heard of a guy named ‘Daniel Walker?”</p>
<p>Among many occupied territories, tyranny was common in economically insignificant small villages. Not only the Awakened but even mercenaries were also witnessed participating in inhumane acts more than once.</p>
<p>However, that was only from the perspective of the mainland as such acts were acceptable in this place and the Stage of Advent. Despite the fact, it was undeniable that if it became known to the mainland, the association would be embarrassed.</p>
<p>After all, the Awakened claimed to be the liberation army in the imperial capital because it was advantageous in the broader view, not because they actually wanted to be a liberation army.</p>
<p>The imperial city was different from other cities, with an entirely different atmosphere beyond the city walls. Just like other small villages, it was completely isolated from the outside world, with tyranny prevalent throughout.</p>
<p>Many seemed like they would scream in terror at the slightest touch were seen on the streets, and they appeared to be the privileged class of the empire. They were born into aristocratic families, received a good education, and managed the entire empire under the emperor. Their faces proved how much they had been exposed to not only physical violence but also psychological abuse.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to see you, the Great Odin.”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to see you, the Great Odin.”</p>
<p>The Awakened stopped and bowed their heads to me at once. I was wearing the Dark Robe of Eos and Yeon-Hee was disguised as well, but they noticed us from the way Hera treated us. The nobles of the empire also knelt in their place.</p>
<p>At that time, those who didn’t know what to do and stood awkwardly were neither Awakened nor mercenaries, but dispatched staff from civilian groups. Some of them bowed discreetly, but others did not.</p>
<p>“Lower your head immediately! Odin is on his way.”</p>
<p>Hera raised her voice, but one man still didn’t bow his head. He was used to this world where all kinds of violence were lurking, but he still didn’t follow the crowd. To him, this was just a workspace, and it was definitely a protest, saying that he came from a democratic world where everyone was equal.</p>
<p>It was truly a stupid act. I didn’t know what kind of pride he had for being the only one not showing respect to me. In the end, he had no choice but to lower his head when the ferocious gazes of the Awakened converged on him.</p>
<p>However, it was too late. Hera gave a signal, and the man was dragged away by an Awakened nearby. No one from the same group of civilian mercenaries with the same logo in their uniform stood up for him. Instead, they seemed to be fed up with his foolishness.</p>
<p>“...I apologize. It is my fault. I will make sure to educate the employees better, so this never happens again.”</p>
<p>The stiff voice came from someone wearing the same logo as the one who was dragged away.</p>
<p>The owner of this castle, Seong-Il, had not yet returned. Or he could have secured his position here, then left for another battlefield without participating in governing it. I heard he was cooperating with Iljoo, and I wondered if that was the Iljoo that I knew.</p>
<p>Soon after, Hera stopped walking.</p>
<p>“Here it is.”</p>
<p>It was the door where Daniel was waiting. There was no reason for him to come to me. Since there was not a single clue that I could guess what was going on with him without meeting him in person, I had stopped thinking too much about him.</p>
<p>As I walked into the room, Hera turned back the way we had come. Daniel was looking out the window, and he turned hastily toward me. He hesitated, then began with the elves’ greeting.</p>
<p>How does he even know the elves’ way of greeting?</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, Odin.”</p>
<p>His explanation was lengthy. Although he appeared to be Daniel, what occupied his insides was the soul of an elf who called himself Aslan. Apparently, this guy was the one who had infiltrated the mainland, as Lunea had mentioned.</p>
<p>There was no doubt about his defection, even at first glance. In addition to consistently showing me a submissive attitude, he was leaking the secrets of the Old One faction without any hesitation. He even expressed his intention to offer me the Soul Ring.</p>
<p>As expected, Yeon-hee nodded, which meant he passed the lie detector.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t have thought about defecting if I hadn’t transferred to this body,” he said.</p>
<p>Poor Daniel. I didn’t have a deep relationship with Daniel, but he had been in charge of a corner of the financial empire and had kept many secrets for the company. He had considerable achievements, so it was sad that he had faded away like that.</p>
<p>“Please be merciful and accept my loyalty, Odin. I will never betray you under your Majesty’s order.”</p>
<p>He took off the Soul Ring, a symbol of his defection, and placed it on the palm of his hand.</p>
<p>[Congratulations! You have acquired a subordinate.]</p>
<p>[Ta-da! ( ๑ ˃̶ ꇴ ˂̶)♪]</p>
<p>But, Lunea… This bastard was…</p>
<p>At that moment, my eyes widened. It was not because of the provocative message Lunea sent again, but it happened when I picked up the Soul Ring from his palm. All my attention was focused on the name of the ring that appeared in the item window.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“You were right, Kanonas. Aslan is living up to our expectations.”</p>
<p>The queen’s long legs as they stretched out toward Kanonas were as white as marble. When she lightly touched his back with the tip of her toes, Kanonas turned his head toward her with a charming smile on his face. It was the smile that the queen cherished.</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty. It was a wise decision to choose Aslan instead of the indulgent Anikas and uncontrollable Anemos.”</p>
<p>Kanonas lit up the candle and returned to the queen.</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to you. However…”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“How was Aslan able to infiltrate the Demon King’s dimension? Wasn’t that a task we had continually failed at? While I am truly pleased that Aslan has lived up to my expectations, it is still troubling.”</p>
<p>Kanonas replied, “He equipped a relic from the Order of our Lord Lacryma.”</p>
<p>“Do you know what it is?”</p>
<p>“It is called the Soul Ring.”</p>
<p>The queen’s face suddenly became ghastly pale. “What?”</p>
<p>Kanonas explained, “We couldn’t avoid giving it to him. Without the Soul Ring, it would have been impossible to infiltrate the Demon King’s territory. Please forget about it.”</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me this now… Why… Why?!”</p>
<p>For the first time, Kanonas saw the furious side of the queen, who had previously only ever smiled at him.</p>
<p>“What has gone wrong?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Kanonas, there is something you don’t know… Why did you do that without permission?! Why! Why did you touch that… Call Aslan right now! Immediately!”</p>
<p>“Please calm down, Your Majesty. Aslan is in the Demon King’s domain.”</p>
<p>However, the queen didn’t hear Kanonas’ answer.</p>
<p>“If that falls into the hands of the Demon King, then we won’t be able to handle it—!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 415</p>
<p>The queen suddenly fell silent as she felt something deep within her was trying to break the shell and come out, filling her entire body and mind. Her pupils became vertical slits like those of a reptile, and her whole body began to tremble uncontrollably shortly after.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty… Please calm down.”</p>
<p>Scales began to cover from her pointy ears to her smooth, white-skinned legs. Her once voluptuous chest shrank and clung to her ribcage, while the sound of her bones twisting and cracking filled the air.</p>
<p>Her green hair fell to the ground at once. Her eyes became full of hunger and excitement, and they flickered before finally calming down with a green crystal-like glow. A Dragorin was standing tall in the mirrors that reflected the queen’s affair with Kanonas.</p>
<p>“I got too excited, Kanonas.”</p>
<p>As the queen said, she revealed her true form whenever she was extremely excited, either due to anger or arousal.</p>
<p>Kanonas remembered the first time he saw her true self. It was the day when he first set his foot in the queen’s bedroom. She was in the midst of a secret and dangerous tryst with her personal guards, someone like Aslan, and she didn’t even bother to hide the scene. The queen saw through Kanonas’s desire to become her lover as he came to her bedroom immediately after his mother, Ruthra, who had also been his lover, died.</p>
<p>“...Yes, Your Majesty. Please speak.”</p>
<p>Kanonas lowered his head at the feet of the queen, whose nails were standing on end.</p>
<p>“The Soul Ring is not a sacred relic created by our Lord Lacryma. It was an object that the first Demon King, Doom Arukuda, lost during the War of New Devil a long time ago.”</p>
<p>Kanonas’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>He asked, “Why was…such a dangerous object sealed away with the other relics?”</p>
<p>She explained, “It was no longer dangerous after the curse was lifted. Our great ancestors even placed it in the safest place in all of Elsland. But the Order!”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the Order was…”</p>
<p>“It should have never been used. I have repeatedly warned people not to touch it.”</p>
<p>Kanonas said, “Many in the Order are committed to delaying the advance of the Demon King’s army.”</p>
<p>“Even if it means going against my wishes?” asked the queen.</p>
<p>Ever since he had become the queen’s lover, Kanonas had been trying to send Aslan, a potential rival, to the Demon King’s realm. In order to do that, he needed to persuade both Aslan and the Order. He did that by finding a foolproof method: Aslan got sent to infiltrate the Doom Man’s territory. By using the Soul Ring, which allowed him to transfer souls into the body of the Demon King’s people, it was a guaranteed success.</p>
<p>Thus, it was Kanonas who recommended Aslan as the leader of the twenty-third expedition team, convinced Aslan, and even used his influence in the Order to allow Aslan to be equipped with the Soul Ring.</p>
<p>Kanonas became busy defending the Order while hiding the truth.</p>
<p>“Enough, enough. That’s not it, Kanonas. The original purpose of the Soul Ring was not to transfer souls.”</p>
<p>“Then… What was it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Doom Arukuda used it to collect powerful souls.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Your Majesty.”</p>
<p>“So, find a way to bring Aslan back as soon as possible. That object must never fall into the hands of any Demon King, no matter if it's Doom Man, Doom Arukuda, or anyone else…”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Saint Cassian’s Soul Transfer Ring (Item)]</p>
<p>[Ruined Doom Arukuda’s Soul Harvest Scythe (Item)]</p>
<p>Doom Arukuda! An instinctual warning shot through my brain. I actually felt pain climbing up my fingers. Anyway, there was something I had to do as soon as I saw Doom Arukuda’s name. Faster than anything else!</p>
<p>[Odin’s Absolute Warzone has been opened.]</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee reacted instantly. She seemed to think that I had sensed some danger. As she clenched the Clown’s Dagger, she knocked down Aslan. With one hand pressing down on his face and the other holding the dagger, she aimed the blade at Aslan’s neck, ready to thrust it at any moment.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Kciphos, who had been quietly sitting in her arms, bared its fierce fangs and waited for her command. I sent a signal that it wasn’t because of Aslan. Only then did Aslan sigh with relief as he had escaped from Yeon-Hee’s threat.</p>
<p>Ever since I entered Saint Dragorin, Lunea had somehow figured out everything I did. If Doom Arukuda discovered that I had taken its item, it would kill me. That was why I opened the warzone immediately without even having a chance to check the item’s detailed information.</p>
<p>However, suddenly…</p>
<p>Swoosh-!</p>
<p>The ring transformed into a huge scythe in my hand without me doing anything. It was the same phenomenon that occurred with Half of the Great Read’s Heart. The Half of the Great Red’s Heart initially had the shape of a broken sword, but it changed into its current small form when I picked it up.</p>
<p>It was the same this time. The ring found its original form in my hand. However, the pain continued to intensify similar to what happened when I acquired Half of the Great Red’s Heart. It was extremely painful. The pain that surged up was the same as when I forcibly absorbed the Old One’s Mana, which was also poisonous to me.</p>
<p>The pain escalated to agony to the point that I almost dropped the scythe to the ground. The sharp blade looked extremely dangerous, capable of cutting any head.</p>
<p>At that moment, Yeon-Hee sprang toward me.</p>
<p>“What is it! What is going on?”</p>
<p>Her pale face flashed in front of me, then disappeared.</p>
<p>“You! What the hell did you bring?”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee yelled at Aslan. She wasn’t really asking out of curiosity.</p>
<p>“...That is what I would like to ask.”</p>
<p>Aslan was bewildered. He had confessed everything he was aware of without omission. Starting with the fact that he was the queen’s bodyguard at the palace, he joined the expedition and, of course, everything he knew about the ring. He even told us of other information he had learned while serving the queen.</p>
<p>The most impressive thing was about Dragorin. He said the Order had begun gathering people who considered themselves Holy Knights, and they were also in the process of finding other Dragorins who were not aware.</p>
<p>In fact, a long-awaited issue was resolved. The queen was Dragorin Green, not the Great Green. Of course, I would have to see for myself through his mental world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee couldn’t hold the scythe either. On the other hand, Aslan could. When he picked it up, it changed back into a ring.</p>
<p>“Gosh…”</p>
<p>Then, when Aslan put it down on the ground, it was still a ring. It was clear that the item had such a high level of resistance that prevented us from using it.</p>
<p>This was not limited to just this item. Before I purified and claimed Doom Entegasto’s rib, I had experienced similar restrictions. Nonetheless, the difference this time was that the intensity was even higher. A power greater than Doom Entegasto’s ability was causing this limit on me. It was so difficult to even pick the scythe again.</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>I thought about two things. First, its name was ‘Saint Cassian’s Soul Transfer Ring’ before it reacted to me. Saint Cassian was one of the two strongest ancient Holy Knights along with Saint Jayden. He was also the one who prophesied long ago that I would become Doom Man, a threat to this world.</p>
<p>The Holy Knights’ swordsmanship and magic were able to continue to exist because of his records. In fact, Saint Cassian was the foundation of the current Saint Dragorin.</p>
<p>Secondly, Saint Cassian had acquired Doom Arukuda’s item. Was it a trophy obtained by defeating Doom Arukuda? In any case, it was reasonable to assume that Saint Cassian had purified the power of Doom Arukuda that was contained within the item by using his own strength. Saint Cassian thus became a powerful transcendent being.</p>
<p>In summary, Saint Cassian was a transcendent being who had left behind a legacy for future generations. He was probably more powerful than I thought as he was capable of taking a weapon from Doom Arukuda as a trophy.</p>
<p>While it was difficult to judge what kind of being he was, I couldn’t help but doubt. There was a possibility that Saint Cassian was the Old One. At the very least, Saint Cassian was definitely one of the ancient dragons, like Saint Jayden.</p>
<p>My hope all along was that Doom Kaos and the Old One were defeatable beings. I wished for them not to be incomprehensible cosmic horrors.</p>
<p>However, the situation was narrowing down to that. I had expected Doom Entegasto to be in an inviolable or terrifying realm beyond comprehension, but it was just a creature made up of materials that could be removed.</p>
<p>I had actually seen Doom Arukuda’s cyclopean eye for a brief moment even before Doom Kaos sealed me. Also, looking at the relics from the War of New Devil, they had fought each other and lost precious parts of them.</p>
<p>If I could step on Doom Entegasto and climb beyond the veil, then I would be certain of what kind of existence Doom Kaos was. Just as Saint Jayden, who was the Great Red, was alive somewhere in the world, Saint Cassian could be as well. If I could face him, then I would also be certain of what he was.</p>
<p>The key to breaking the chains that bind me lay in confirming the true nature of such beings.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: We must end this within the time the battlefield is open.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Tell me more in detail. How should we end this?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Apart from what exactly this is and whether I can make it my possession, it is unpredictable how Doom Arukuda will react if I take it outside of the Absolute Warzone.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: So?</p>
<p>- It’s simple. I have to become stronger. Strong enough to reach a realm I cannot see at the moment.</p>
<p>I had to decide how to dispose of that thing. If it was inevitable that I needed to take it outside, then I needed a way not to be caught off guard like the last meeting. I had to have at least some power to resist higher Dooms like Doom Entegasto or Doom Arukuda, the owner of this item. It was estimated that the item also had resistance to its power. After all, it was an item of Doom Arukuda.</p>
<p>If I succeeded in completely taking it…</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: I won’t ask why you have come to that conclusion. You seem quite urgent right now. How long is the battlefield going to be maintained?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Twenty-four hours.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: If you have to become stronger in that time, then it must be from there, right?</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Yes, within the mental world. We won’t be limited by time there.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: The battlefield is solid, right? Entering the mental world doesn’t completely stop the time here. It flows, even if just for a fleeting moment.</p>
<p>It meant that it could be dangerous if some transcendent being interfered here. If Doom Arukuda learned that his object had come to me, and if he decided to exercise his power on me, then things would have already gotten noisy.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the speed at which the battlefield unfolded was fast, enough to avoid Lunea’s surveillance network.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: You don’t need to worry about that.</p>
<p>- Yeon-Hee: Good, Seon-Hu. So, where should we start?</p>
<p>I pointed at Aslan with my chin.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Elsland.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 416</p>
<p>In this world, I was Anemos, one of the most influential nobles, and Yeon-Hee was my wife. This world was created based on Aslan’s memories, and Anemos was the freest among all the aristocrats in his memory.</p>
<p>Anemos was the perfect candidate for me to focus on Mana research. No one bothered him even though he didn’t visit the palace frequently, nor did he host parties at his mansion like the other elven nobles. Therefore, the only moment he could be interrupted was now.</p>
<p>It’s about time.</p>
<p>I heard footsteps climbing the stairs.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the interruption, Mr. Anemos. The queen has sent a guest…!”</p>
<p>This female elf’s name was Elena, a commoner who had come in as a maid.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Mainland.</p>
<p>The reason why parents in Daechi-dong[1] was obsessed with their kids’ education were because they weren’t in top positions in society. They hoped that their children would enter prestigious universities and establish a respectable social status based on their academic background, just as they had done.</p>
<p>However, parents in Apgujeong and Cheongdam-dong were different. They had always been confident that they could pass their positions on to their kids, regardless of whether their children were good or bad at studying. They were in a position to inherit their status easily as they were forming an inner circle with the Jeonil Group in the center.</p>
<p>However, in the elven society..? The structure was primarily like Apgujeong and Cheongdam-dong, but there was no Daechi-dong. The social structure was divided only between the extremely small upper class and the majority of commoners like Elena, with no middle class.</p>
<p>The extraordinary aspect of the elven society compared to the Greenwood Continent or our medieval mainland was that their social structure had naturally emerged. They did not define class by law.</p>
<p>Similar to the United States, which did not need to enact financial real name laws, their social classes were naturally created by social agreement. The palace and its surroundings were the residential areas of the upper class, and those who lived here did not hesitate to call themselves nobles.</p>
<p>I thought it was because of the lifestyle that the elves enjoyed. They lived for hundreds of years once they were born, and the succession that worked in countless families from ancient times had created the current elven society. In this way, Elsland was a world ruled by customs, and there was no separate law.</p>
<p>The power struggles of the elven upper class were fierce and cunning, perhaps because they were trapped in their own world. Therefore, it would have been reasonable for Yeon-Hee to appear like that.</p>
<p>When she returned after attending the palace party that day, I could smell the strong scent of blood. Her fur dress was soaked in blood and it dripped everywhere. It wasn’t her first time, so she was annoyed, wriggling her pointed ears.</p>
<p>“I will reset.”</p>
<p>Then, the door opened cautiously with a knock.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the interruption, Mr. Anemos. The queen has sent a guest…!”</p>
<p>Elena’s eyes widened when she saw the blood-soaked lady in front of her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Which one would you choose between a happy fake world and an unhappy real world? People usually choose the former since the difference between fake and real is only a matter of perception.</p>
<p>However, I would choose the latter. A stable environment where I could devote myself to exploration without any other stress. A beautiful snowfield was visible through the window. A warm fireplace that made me forget the cold climate, Various delicacies and alcohol without hangovers. Incense that abundantly evoked happy emotions.</p>
<p>Even if such things were infinitely provided, I could answer without hesitation as there was a world outside that I needed to protect.</p>
<p>However, I was concerned about Yeon-Hee. With the invasion of Elsland in mind, I frequently visited the palace to uncover a part of Elsland’s situation that Aslan might have carelessly missed. When that was over, Yeon-Hee would melt into this fake world.</p>
<p>It was different from extracting only important memories from the subject. We were living on a new stage as new characters, living in that world again.</p>
<p>Half a year had already passed. We had reset the world several times, but that was how long we had spent in Aslan’s memories.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I came out of focus because it was time for the disturbance to arrive. The unwelcome guest Elena, who inevitably visited at this time whenever the stage was reset.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the interruption, Mr. Anemos. The queen has sent a guest…!”</p>
<p>Ignoring her was useless as I had tried that before. The guest the queen sent was Aslan, the owner of this memory, and he never returned until he personally delivered the message sent by the queen.</p>
<p>At that time, Aslan must have peeped at the message, and that was why the contents of the message would be clearly remembered, not in black and white.</p>
<p>「Dear Anemos,</p>
<p>Since the arrival of Demon King Doom Man as prophesied, the Greenwood Continent has been burning rapidly. It was unbearable for the weak inhabitants of the continent. Greenwood’s Holy Knights are also inevitably showing the limits of their kind.</p>
<p>However, my concerns do not cease as there are weak and vulgar things like the inhabitants of Greenwood even in our Lord Lacryma’s sanctuary, outside of the court. Wouldn’t it be good to form a corps of the sanctuary and prepare for the night? However, the atmosphere in the court is chaotic as Anikas has openly criticized Ruthra’s son, Kanonas, recently.</p>
<p>If you accept the plan of mediation…」</p>
<p>The message hasn’t changed this time either. I pushed it aside and resumed focusing on my studies. Every time I concentrated, I realized that the Old One had designed the Awakened properly. In particular, the mechanism of the skill area, which had its own rotation power and worked like a self-generator, was beyond words.</p>
<p>That was where I had been constantly investing my efforts. I wanted to imitate the rotation power, deciphering the Old One’s blueprint. That was my first goal to achieve. If I could master Mana manipulation to the point where I could imitate it, then I was convinced that a new field would be revealed.</p>
<p>And one day, it happened. One day…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We repeated the stage countlessly. The starting point was when Kanonas entered the queen’s life as her lover, and the end point was when Aslan was equipped with the Soul Ring and sent to the expedition. Each stage took about three months.</p>
<p>“I apologize for the interruption, Mr. Anemos. The queen has sent a guest…!”</p>
<p>Looking back, I had heard this voice more than ten times. I thought it was time to change the stage for Yeon-Hee’s sake. She needed to get out of the palace.</p>
<p>“You want to change the stage?”</p>
<p>I was the one who chose this stage as the starting point, but since confirming the identity of Elsland’s Queen, Yeon-Hee insisted on this stage. She thought that it would be more efficient to proceed with the work in the stage where information that would help in the future was abundant.</p>
<p>She figured out everything, including the geography of the palace, the magical system protecting the court, and the faces of each noble, through Aslan’s subconsciousness. However, she even learned the presumed location where one of the three primordial temples existed.</p>
<p>“I am sick of it.”</p>
<p>When I replied, Yeon-Hee narrowed her eyes. She stared at my face for a while, probably because she was still blocking her Empathy. Then, her face regained a smile at once.</p>
<p>“Seon-Hu!”</p>
<p>She threw herself at me, still in her Anemos’s wife character. She pulled my face into her ample bosom and didn’t let me go. She seemed happy to joke around after a long time. It wasn’t because the moment to change the stage had come, but because she had noticed something.</p>
<p>When I took my face out of her bosom, I saw her sparkling eyes. Although she had the face of Anemos’s wife, those eyes were unmistakably Yeon-Hee’s.</p>
<p>Really? Did you really figure it out? Finally?</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee looked at me as if she was asking those questions.</p>
<p>“Yes, there is something I want to try.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s voice became faint at once.</p>
<p>Swoosh-!</p>
<p>When I returned to reality, I vividly remembered the scene in this room. I had forgotten about this room for years.</p>
<p>Doom Arukuda’s stuff was still on the floor, and the curtain of the Absolute Warzone hung on the inner walls. Aslan, who occasionally appeared as a nuisance, stood in the form of Daniel. He wasn’t wearing the palace formal attire but instead a mainland suit.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Odin’s Absolute Warzone): 23 hours 53 minutes 31 seconds]</p>
<p>It had been one second since I last checked before entering the mental world. I sat down comfortably, and Yeon-Hee’s eyes sparkled with anticipation. Although the face of Anemos’s wife overlapped with her real face, seeing her true face in reality brought joy.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee told Aslan to go away, and her use of the unique pronunciation of elves was natural. I couldn’t do it like she did. As Aslan stepped aside with a surprised look, I began to focus on the internal movement.</p>
<p>I concentrated on the area in charge of the A-class Teleportation insignia and felt a sensation of being enveloped in a speed that seemed to suck my entire body in.</p>
<p>Swaaaak-</p>
<p>This feeling was a clear sign that I had completed a high level of concentration. I manipulated the area gently, as if caressing it with an intangible hand. The design containing rotational force was engraved in my mind, so I didn’t need to use the skill area as a reference.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there was no way to replenish the insignia once it was destroyed, as I couldn’t go out of the Absolute Warzone. Therefore, I had to be extremely careful. The tension as if I was handling an explosive had to be guarded against. Reaching the state of self-annihilation was a prerequisite.</p>
<p>I opened my eyes.</p>
<p>[The insignia ‘Teleportation’ has been removed.]</p>
<p>The message was disappearing, and a new message appeared over it.</p>
<p>[You have acquired the skill ‘Hermes’s Teleportation.’]</p>
<p>However, the main purpose of coming back to reality wasn’t this. I had expected that I would be able to combine rotational force into the insignia and copy the teleportation skill through other types of insignias rather than just Teleportation!</p>
<p>What I wanted to check was the next step. When I was able to see through the design of the skill, I noticed what more was possible. Therefore, the task I wanted to try was clear.</p>
<p>First, I needed to dismantle the teleportation skill I just created in the Mana area. Then, I had to direct the dismantled Mana to the shell surrounding the entire area, including skills, traits, and insignias, and try to increase the size of the shell.</p>
<p>Whoosh-!</p>
<p>A feeling of mingled drowsiness, not knowing how much time had passed, and the sensation that came from the last moment of self-annihilation were intertwined. My back was soaked with sweat, and a new message was waiting for me.</p>
<p>[Skill ‘Hermes’s Teleportation’ has been removed.]</p>
<p>Another message overlaid on top of it.</p>
<p>[You have gained XP.]</p>
<p>Yes, this was it!</p>
<p>1. A neighborhood located in Gangnam-gu, Seoul, South Korea. It is known for its high-end residential areas, commercial buildings, and cram school districts. ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 417</p>
<p>[Level: 600 (92.26%)]</p>
<p>[Level: 600 (92.38%)]</p>
<p>0.12 percent. That was the amount that increased when I used the Mana contained in one A-class Teleportation insignia as XP. The increase was negligible, like adding a bucket of water to the ocean.</p>
<p>However, my new abilities to turn insignias into skills, absorb their Mana to use as level-up materials, and then fuse skills and traits together caused a great thrill in my heart as I had not expected this. My greatest achievement was gaining the ability to see through Mana!</p>
<p>Of course, being able to absorb Mana from an insignia alone didn’t have much meaning. The same went for when I went out of the Absolute Warzone as insignias were rare. In the Stage of Advent, the Awakened usually obtained items and skills when they received boxes.</p>
<p>Anyway, I hadn’t completely mastered the design of the Old One. I couldn’t figure out the principle that allowed for power to explode beyond the original Mana constraint when certain conditions were met, like traits Man Who Overcomes Adversity, Forerunner, and the Gifted. Nor did I find a way to unlock the locks on Power, and it seemed like it would take a long time for me to delve into that.</p>
<p>I was confident I wouldn’t get numb to the passing time, but it could be dangerous for Yeon-Hee. That was why I turned my attention to items for the next step. If only I could absorb the Mana imbued in items…</p>
<p>“We just took one step up on the stairs and that is it. Let’s move on to the next stage.”</p>
<p>“Where to?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Any moment when you were happy.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jonathan looked out the window, and Kim Cheong-Soo was having a meeting with key figures related to the trial there. It was a gathering that could lead to another scandal if it became known outside.</p>
<p>Judiciary officials, as well as political figures who had participated in attacking Jonathan during the hearing, were sweating nervously. They seemed to deeply regret having momentarily forgotten the physiology of politics and being swept away by mob psychology. Although they were smiling, their eyes were filled with the dim light of worry for their future.</p>
<p>That was when the guest Jonathan had been waiting for arrived. He was from the Federal Reserve Board (FED), an organization known to have strict independence from the government and was under Seon-Hu’s control.</p>
<p>As the person entrusted with the throne of the club, Jonathan couldn’t devote all his time to the protests. That was why Liam, the President of the FED, was one of the people he had to meet.</p>
<p>Liam looked at the secret meeting taking place in the room across from him and moved when Jonathan gestured.</p>
<p>Liam’s footsteps were heavy due to tension. Not only did the supernatural destructive power Jonathan showed at the hearing shock him, but he had also ascended to the position of running the club on his behalf. He was now the leader of the world’s shadow government.</p>
<p>“I heard you were attacked.”</p>
<p>Jonathan nodded in response. “Is everything manageable at the Federal Reserve Board?”</p>
<p>After answering affirmatively, Liam carefully took out the gift he had brought with him. It was an aluminum box. Jonathan could tell what was inside without having to open it, as there was a tag of the exchange glued on the box. It was an A-class defense item classified as an original and not a dupe.</p>
<p>Liam explained, “I wasn’t sure how to help, so I sought assistance from many people.”</p>
<p>Items like this were scattered throughout the Cat Food Warehouse, which had been stockpiled by Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Jonathan didn’t scold him for doing useless things or asking where the money came from to secure this.</p>
<p>Instead, Jonathan said, “Don’t be nervous. You won’t be able to talk to me properly in that state. Do you think you can do this? We can just talk normally like before, Liam.”</p>
<p>However, Liam’s tension didn’t disappear easily.</p>
<p>They heard Brian’s loud voice from the room across, and he was scolding the judiciary and administrative personnel. President Liam felt as if he was being reprimanded as well.</p>
<p>Also, a powerful figure, who appeared calm but was likely filled with rage inside, was sitting in front of him. His anger would have been aggravated by the attack from the aliens last night. The mansion of the King of Hell had burned down last night. Surprisingly, it was a place where the man had poured his affection into by even participating in the design during construction.</p>
<p>Liam couldn’t easily bring up the main purpose of his visit to Jonathan. As the heavy atmosphere started to press down on Liam’s shoulders, Jonathan spoke first.</p>
<p>“Is it about the standard interest?”</p>
<p>Liam said yes, then began speaking after taking a sip of water to wet his dry lips and throat. It was natural to consult on this matter as the president of the Federal Reserve, but for some reason, it required him to have more courage. This was because what he wanted to discuss went against the direction of the decision made at the last club meeting.</p>
<p>“In December 2015, the interest rate was raised by 0.25 percent for the first time since the 2008 financial crisis. Since then, it has gradually increased, but it has maintained a zero-interest rate from the Day of Advent.”</p>
<p>Jonathan nodded. It was Seon-Hu’s decision to pull the stagnant global stock market up after the Day of Advent. He drastically lowered interest rates while releasing the stocks held by their New York company and Gillian Investment Finance Group into the market.</p>
<p>The result had been reflected directly in the market, and the global stock market was now enjoying greater prosperity than ever. Well… \except for China, which had once tried to defy the order of the club.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that there is a bubble? Or that economic indicators have improved?” asked Jonathan.</p>
<p>Liam responded, “Both. However, I think this issue will be one of the main topics at next year’s club meeting, after this year.”</p>
<p>Although it was not yet at the level of mentioning the 2008 global economic crisis, it was an issue that had to be addressed.</p>
<p>Liam’s explanation then became lengthy. Interest rates determined by the U.S. Federal Reserve tended to lead the global economy. All countries over the world had to establish their monetary policy based on U.S. policy or adjust accordingly.</p>
<p>Jonathan checked the data brought by Liam. It had been a low-interest-rate era before the Day of Advent. After that day, the world had entered a zero-interest-rate era, causing private capital to flow into real estate as it had during the 2008 global economic crisis.</p>
<p>Given the reduced liquidity of stocks available for private purchase, the real estate market’s movement was indeed unusual. Hedge funds betting on a long-term crisis were already emerging.</p>
<p>Jonathan suddenly recalled the years he spent with Seon-Hu. They had predicted the global crisis in advance and steadily grew their capital through them. The exhilaration had dominated his body whenever they placed bets one after another.</p>
<p>He suddenly missed those years, when he was thirsty for challenges. The next step, the next achievement, was obvious back then. However, he now had to oversee the commotion as he had reached the top of the stairs.</p>
<p>After a while, Jonathan snapped out of his old memories and turned his attention to Korea. Korea was Seon-Hu’s homeland where his parents still resided, so he couldn’t help but keep an eye on it from time to time.</p>
<p>Of course, Liam couldn’t understand why Jonathan suddenly stopped the conversation and started examining the situation in a small country like Korea.</p>
<p>As expected…</p>
<p>Korea’s stock and real estate markets were both at their peak. Korean stocks were less liquid in the market, scattered throughout Seon-Hu’s multiple pockets, such as the Jeonil Group, their New York company, and the Gillian Group. This was not the only reason, but South Korea had consistently been like this as they used real estate rather than the stock market to increase wealth.</p>
<p>With the Federal Reserve maintaining zero interest rates, the central bank of South Korea was also operating at low-interest rates. As a result, Koreans didn’t feel burdened when getting loans, and they were spending a ton of money on real estate. The term ‘gap investment’ spread like a trend, and people who bought dozens or even hundreds of apartments were hailed as investment geniuses.</p>
<p>Thus, if the U.S. Federal Reserve started to raise interest rates, then this would have a negative impact on South Korea. The central bank of South Korea would have no choice but to raise interest rates, and the banks under its jurisdiction would naturally have to follow suit.</p>
<p>This meant an increase in interest rates by the U.S. Federal Reserves would definitely burden the Korean public who had purchased real estate with loans. Factors such as the increase in interest rates, South Korea’s economic ecosystem, and their real estate policy could overlap and create a tipping point, leading to a massive sell-off in Korean real estate and causing the real estate bubble to burst.</p>
<p>But the Korean government should deal with that.</p>
<p>Jonathan finally made his decision. While it was undeniable that South Korea was the homeland of Seon-Hu, the global economic flow should not be swayed by one country.</p>
<p>Seon-Hu would have made the same decision after achieving his own goals. It was time to raise interest rates. Therefore, it was necessary to burst the growing bubble and dispel concerns about inflation. Once the process was over, there would come a time when it would have to be lowered again to stimulate the economy…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Jonathan and Chairman Liam’s private meeting ended, the conference that Kim Cheong-Soo had been conducting in the room across from had already finished as well.</p>
<p>Jonathan received a report on the secret agreement that Kim Cheong-Soo had confirmed during the meeting. Then, Jonathan explained the future interest rate policy to him with the command to readjust the portfolio of Jonathan Group according to the gradually increasing interest rates.</p>
<p>“I will inform the club members, including the Gillians, about this. Also, have you checked the blueprint?”</p>
<p>He was referring to the labyrinth bunker. Although Jonathan didn’t like the design of the new residence that was formulated with an alien invasion in mind, it was one of the things that had to be prepared like raising interest rates. Jonathan nodded briefly, so Kim Cheong-Soo left.</p>
<p>Jonathan took out a bottle of whiskey as he was finally alone. It was the same brand of whiskey he had kept for decades, anticipating the day he would meet with Seon-Hu in the Stage of Advent. Even as he poured the alcohol, Jonathan’s Sense was raised.</p>
<p>Come and fight me if you want.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop thinking about the elf, who had just investigated him and fled.</p>
<p>The notification sound of an incoming video call almost pierced his eardrums like a drill as his Sense was raised. His Sense was so acute that he could feel the subtle vibrations of the computer speaker.</p>
<p>「Caller: Mick」</p>
<p>It was Mick’s account that Jonathan had just saved last week when Seon-Hu had entrusted the club’s throne. When he picked up the call, a desperate face and an equally urgent voice came out.</p>
<p>“A transcendent has attacked!”</p>
<p>The monitor was showing the interior of the Cat Food Warehouse.</p>
<p>Transcendent?</p>
<p>The video indeed failed to capture the movement of the transcendent properly. At first, only the traces it created at an incredible speed were visible. But when Jonathan focused his Sense a little more on his vision, he caught something for a brief second with his bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>Sun?</p>
<p>The one who was mistaken for the attacking transcendent was undoubtedly Seon-Hu. He appeared as desperate as Mick, who had called Jonathan, and Seon-Hu was rummaging through the warehouse items.</p>
<p>“It’s not an attack. It’s Odin!”</p>
<p>Something had definitely happened to Seon-Hu. The moment the traces of Seon-Hu disappeared, Jonathan urgently shouted at the monitor, “Where did he go? Hurry up!”</p>
<p>Then the screen showing the items switched to the side. There, the traces created by Seon-Hu’s movements were stirring everywhere. It was an area where mana stones were stored.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 418</p>
<p>However, Seon-Hu suddenly disappeared from the monitor again, and Jonathan immediately decided to use a helicopter to go south, where the Cat Food Warehouse was located. While waiting for the helicopter on the rooftop, the hot summer night wind kept hitting him. It was unbearably humid and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Even on such a hot night, people were still protesting on Wall Street, but their numbers had noticeably decreased. Despite the positive messages being consistently conveyed in major media and the situation in the hearing, many still needed to be convinced. The alien invasion on Jonathan’s mansion the other day seemed to have played a significant role.</p>
<p>&lt;Brian Kim: Did you receive it?&gt;</p>
<p>Jonathan had asked Kim Cheong-Soo to send him the recorded video as there were parts that he couldn’t capture even with his challenger section’s enhanced Sense.</p>
<p>Jonathan watched the video of the moment Seon-Hu disappeared several times. There was no need to play the video slowly as he was maximizing his Sense. He had once tried learning Korean, Seon-Hu’s native language, but he ended up giving up as he was too busy to find time for it. He was frustrated with so many unfamiliar pronunciations and the fast speech of Koreans.</p>
<p>He felt the same now. Catching up to the traces of Seon-Hu was daunting. He disappeared too quickly, making it impossible to even guess how and where he vanished as if part of the video was cropped. His disappearance surpassed the realm of perception.</p>
<p>By the time the helicopter arrived, Jonathan’s eyes were bloodshot. Even after boarding the helicopter, he remained immersed in the same task. Fatigue accumulated in his eyes, and the blood vessels seemed ready to burst.</p>
<p>However, his effort was not in vain as he managed to capture something. Seon-Hu’s waist bent backward in his last moment as if he was being sucked in or forcibly pulled by some powerful force.</p>
<p>Jonathan had a hunch.</p>
<p>Did Doom Kaos summon the Demon Kings for a meeting again? Why?</p>
<p>After arriving, Jonathan found out that all the items in the Cat Food Warehouse had become useless. None of them increased his defense even when he activated his Sixth Sense.</p>
<p>Jonathan discovered a similar phenomenon in the warehouse where mana stones were stored. A majority of them had lost their unique black color.</p>
<p>He searched the warehouse thoroughly, but found no trace of blood or any signs of battle. However, he couldn’t be reassured by that. If his assumption was correct, then Seon-Hu might have found a way to absorb the energy in the items and mana stones.</p>
<p>However, the expression on Seon-Hu’s face when he suddenly broke into the warehouse and his last appearance looked truly urgent. Jonathan’s face became even more serious and wrinkles formed on his forehead.</p>
<p>They had divided up their responsibilities as Seon-Hu was in charge of outer space while Jonathan governed the mainland. However, before that, Seon-Hu’s fight had always been lonely. Jonathan wanted to help Seon-Hu in addition to maintaining order on the mainland.</p>
<p>He stared at the scattered mana stones for a long time before moving on. Mick was waiting outside the warehouse. That was when Jonathan shifted his gaze to Mick’s chest pocket. Something he had missed when he first arrived at the warehouse was there.</p>
<p>There was a container filled with a few red pills inside the pocket, and Jonathan was aware of the drug. Spider Web. It was a stimulant that was circulating in the black market. Some used it to maximize sexual arousal, but civilians used it to turn themselves into superhumans. Its effectiveness had been proven, and it was just waiting to be officially released in the market.</p>
<p>Jonathan realized that Mick felt uncomfortable with his glance, so he looked away. He then ordered the disposal of the items and mana stones that had lost their unique colors through either incineration or dumping into a landfill.</p>
<p>“Have you been bored lately, with less work to do?” Jonathan asked.</p>
<p>“Do you have anything that you want me to do?” asked Mick.</p>
<p>The original purpose of the Cat Food Warehouse was already gone. However, the information system that was in place to track and monitor the pre-Awakened was arguably more advanced than that of the World Awakened Association. This was because numerous communication company lines were connected to this organization, which was a scaled-down version of Big Brother that the public found so terrifying.</p>
<p>“There are people who need to be removed and people who need to be constantly monitored. It had always been like that. Now, I would like you to take on those responsibilities.”</p>
<p>The names of politicians, social activists, and investigative journalists crossed Jonathan’s mind. There were persistent individuals who chased after the club’s shadows, orchestrated protests behind the scenes, and tried to approach the Destiny Group. Due to these individuals being deemed in need of cleaning, the club had to increase the number of cleaners.</p>
<p>Anyway, Jonathan wondered what he could do to support Seon-Hu on the mainland. It was a method he already realized when looking at the colorless mana stones.</p>
<p>If Seon-Hu learned how to extract energy from items and mana stones, then I should focus on securing them.</p>
<p>Although he wanted to forcibly collect the other’s items, he couldn’t provoke them any further. Their dissatisfaction was being resolved as the occupied territories in outer space increased, but the Awakened who hadn’t entered there were still harboring a fire similar to the protestors. They couldn’t openly express their discontent due to the fear they had for Seon-Hu.</p>
<p>Therefore, Jonathan decided that now was the right time to authorize the release of the awakening agent Spider Web and announce the results of the mana stone research to the world.</p>
<p>On his way back to his temporary residence, he called Lee Tae-Han.</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Is it true that the Greenwood species are collecting mana stones as spoils?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: Yes, they collect them as spoils and materials for magic towers.&gt;</p>
<p>This meant a large quantity of mana stones was already being circulated in outer space without necessarily causing conflict with the Seven Demon Kings Corps.</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: They have also succeeded in converting mana stones into energy. Do you know about the Destiny Group?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: I don’t know much about it.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: But you must know what they are researching, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: Yes.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: The research is complete. Let me change the subject for a bit. What is the short-term goal of the association?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: To occupy the central part of the Greenwood Continent. If we completely control that area, then we can proceed with aggressive expansion of our territory.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: In that case, the Awakened would need a stronger motivation than just the item market, like mana stones.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: …&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Strengthen the mercenaries to speed up the process.&gt;</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han rebutted cautiously. Spider Web wouldn’t be a big problem as it could be strictly implemented only for trained mercenaries.</p>
<p>Therefore, the issue lay in the world that would change with the concentrated energy stored in mana stones. If it were revealed that the research institute that had been studying mana stones was closely linked to Jonathan Group in a situation where the public was already protesting against their wealth monopoly…</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: …Would that be okay?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: That is why we will announce the research results in a scaled-down manner. I would like the association to handle the mana stone retrieval. The group will send you Benjamin.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Lee Tae-Han: Who is Benjamin?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Jonathan: Benjamin Franklin.&gt;</p>
<p>This novel is available on "pawread dot com".</p>
<p>Jonathan was talking about the man on the one hundred-dollar bill.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“The Federal Reserve, the central bank of the United States, has announced a plan to raise its standard rate. As the U.S. takes steps to raise interest rates, attention is once again focused on the impact this will have on the domestic economy. The KOSPI started with a 0.52 percent decline as investor sentiment was dampened by the news of the U.S. increasing interest rates. Today’s net sell-off amount is 144 billion won, and foreign investors who had net bought 114 billion won since the beginning of the month have turned to net selling in just one day. Let’s connect to the correspondent reporter.”</p>
<p>“Yes, the FED has hinted that they will increase the rate five times next year, starting with the next quarter. They also announced that they will increase the speed of the hikes. They believe that a gradual increase in interest rates is desirable for maximizing employment and stabilizing prices, as the shock from the Day of Advent has subsided. It is also expected that if the European Central Bank joins in raising interest rates, the impact on the Korean stock market will expand…”</p>
<p>“Wait a sec… Breaking news. The leader of the World Awakened Association, Lee Tae-Han, and the CFO of Jonathan Investment Finance Group, Kim Cheong-Soo, are preparing for a surprise joint announcement at their headquarters.”</p>
<p>The newsreader swallowed his saliva and then continued.</p>
<p>“According to the information we just received, there are two issues to be addressed. One is about the Destiny Research Institution that has been studying the Black Stone, an organ of an extraterrestrial creature, and the other is about Spider Web that has been secretly circulating in the North American continent.”</p>
<p>「Breaking News: World Awakened Association and Jonathan Investment Finance Group’s Joint Announcement」</p>
<p>「Breaking News: Likely to Discuss Black Stone and Spider Web」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An ordinary job seeker, Kim Min-Jae, stopped his morning routine. He had never watched the news before the Day of Advent. To be precise, he had watched the news during the impeachment crisis, but after that event ended, he had lost interest in politics until just before the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>However, he had always left the television on since the Day of Advent and his release from martial law. The channel was set to a news-only channel.</p>
<p>The newsreader was busy talking about China, which he hated as their fine dust kept blowing into Korea. It was also talking about entering the IMF system and a transcendent being from outer space. Listening to the news about items that only Awakened could use, which were traded daily, reminded him of a game he was once addicted to.</p>
<p>Moreover, the wealth of the world had been concentrated in a few large corporations since the Day of Advent, which ended up being focused on the Jonathan Investment Finance Group.</p>
<p>Jonathan Hunter of Jonathan Group had long concealed his wealth through anonymous transactions. That case was also discussed daily on the news. On top of that, an alien civilization attacked his mansion, and the news kept reporting the incidents involving unregistered Awakened evading the security forces. They were more interesting than any other entertainment program.</p>
<p>This time, it was about the Black Stone and Spider Web!</p>
<p>This is why I can’t stop watching television. I should find a part-time job at least… Ugh. I should have awakened.</p>
<p>Kim Min-Jae even murmured as he turned up the television volume instead of just thinking inwardly. If only he had awakened…</p>
<p>“My life would have been much better.”</p>
<p>An hour later, the joint announcement of the association and the Jonathan Group began. The wait was not boring. Lee Tae-Han was the president of Ilsung, but had returned as an Awakened, and Kim Cheong-Soo was considered a top executive in a super-giant group.</p>
<p>As stories and related materials involving the two continued, Kim Min-Jae felt a thrilling sensation as if he was contributing to national prestige. He was proud of his nation all of a sudden.</p>
<p>He could forget about his anxiety regarding job hunting and the future for a moment and started enjoying the moment.</p>
<p>“President Lee Tae-Han of the World Awakened Association and CFO Kim Cheong-Soo are now entering together.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 419</p>
<p>I was finally free.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Odin’s Absolute Warzone): 23 hours 22 minutes 49 seconds]</p>
<p>The message changed two seconds after we escaped the second stage. Though only two seconds passed here, it felt so long in the mental world.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee had been silent and seemed to be trying to adapt to the reality that we had returned to. As soon as she saw Aslan, who she hadn’t seen in a while, she sent a signal to tell him to stay put. There was no awkwardness in giving orders to Aslan as her mentality was stronger than we had been concerned about.</p>
<p>Srrr-</p>
<p>I moved to the spot in front of the ring. The first thought that came to mind after looking down at it beneath my feet was that I still couldn’t be sure whether Doom Kaos wouldn’t care about me taking it. Even if Doom Kaos didn’t mind, the problem was how Doom Arukuda would react to it.</p>
<p>Arukuda could be different from Entegasto, and he could defy Doom Kaos’s command and try to regain his old possession through some sort of secret plot. I would have done the same thing in his shoes, so I had to keep that possibility in mind.</p>
<p>Its item was filled with powerful Mana, and now I could see through that far. However, that was it. Picking it up again was still impossible, so I hadn’t discovered its amazing potential yet.</p>
<p>Since this was the case, I had two choices.</p>
<p>1. Give up on the item’s Power and absorb only its Mana right here.</p>
<p>2. Keep it until the moment of purification in the future while risking the possibility that Arukuda could take it away.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was an obvious decision! I needed to engulf everything when I could. It was a shame, but if a satisfactory profit was secured in front of me, it was wise to cash it in first.</p>
<p>A task that had to be accompanied first crossed my mind. It was because I could see clearly how the ring would be destroyed if I extracted Mana from it. The process of the ring’s destruction would continue until the duration of the Absolute Warzone ended. By then, Lunea would figure out what was happening inside here.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even if it was for securing other relics in the future, I had to get confirmation from Doom Kaos this time. I had to prove that I was more useful than he thought. Therefore, I gathered all available resources, including items and mana stones sleeping in the Cat Food Warehouse, and maximized my level. I had a plan.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I learned something new while studying Mana, and it was the fact that the energy in stones was its tenacious hold on life. Looking back, Doom Kaos created mana stones based on the remaining Mana with its Power for the Awakened when I joined the Demon King Corps.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, he didn’t intervene in our use of mana stones because he expected me to resist strongly.</p>
<p>Anyway, assuming that I would enter the Cat Food Warehouse, I needed to save time extracting Mana and life force from the stones. It was difficult to predict how much time it would take to repeat the self-annihilating concentration multiple times.</p>
<p>Therefore, I had to create an automatic mechanism inside my body that would activate the extraction and absorption. After putting all the remaining insignias in, a new vortex appeared in the area of the traits. I felt the Explorer moving fiercely. It was pulling out the old remnants.</p>
<p>[The trait ‘Retrieval’ has proceeded.]</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>[You have activated Extractor.]</p>
<p>[You have leveled up.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[You have leveled up.]</p>
<p>As soon as I extracted Mana from the ring, I handed over the Half of the Great Red’s Heart and Xi Wangmu's Ten Thousand Year Old Spider to Yeon-Hee. Then, I entered the Cat Food Warehouse.</p>
<p>[You have leveled up.]</p>
<p>There was no time to enjoy the fullness of the shell inside me. The ring was slowly being destroyed as it scattered the power of Saint Cassian in outer space.</p>
<p>[What the hell have you done!!! Hurry up and come back! Right now! I warned you.]</p>
<p>Even after a long time, the message from the bastard still appeared, getting on my nerves.</p>
<p>[Your Almighty Master, Doom Kaos, has summoned a meeting of the Demon Kings.]</p>
<p>I felt an overwhelming suctioning force from the back! My waist instantly bent. By the time I was thrown down the stairs by the force, the message had disappeared. The thud as I hit the ground even shook my bones. The taste of blood lingered in my mouth. When I spat at the floor, red blood mixed with saliva came out.</p>
<p>[ ( ･᷄д･᷅ ) I knew this would happen.]</p>
<p>The gazes of Doom Mount from the upper stairs and Caso and Lunea from the stairs below were all focused on me. The contemptuous glance came from the asshole Lunea. Doom Mount and Caso probably didn’t know what was happening, but they realized that I had become a target of the higher Dooms again. The tension in their eyes was obvious in the darkness.</p>
<p>[They are giving you a chance to defend yourself.]</p>
<p>“Who? Our Almighty Master? Or is it Doom Arukuda…?”</p>
<p>[You seem to have figured out the situation now. Both of them. Try it, Doom Man.]</p>
<p>“But what kind of excuse should I make?”</p>
<p>[What’s wrong with you? Do you think you can avoid this by pretending not to know anything? You stole Doom Arukuda’s scythe. You crossed the line. You are too greedy, Doom Man.]</p>
<p>“Oh, so it is because of that.”</p>
<p>[What else would it be? Hurry up, Doom Man. Don’t test the patience of those above you.]</p>
<p>Lunea was dedicated to its role as a clown entertaining the emperor.</p>
<p>“I will speak to Doom Kaos!” I shouted while raising my head towards the curtain. “Was I supposed to hand over the higher-ups’ items to the original owner when I obtained them? I thought this was connived in the last meeting.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I was on the front lines of this battle as you intended. Also, I desperately want this war to end as soon as possible, more than anyone, for the sake of my mainland. But the more I learned, the more I realized that very powerful beings exist in this world. Like Ancient Dragons called Saint Cassian and Saint Jayden.”</p>
<p>No one commented on my remarks.</p>
<p>“What about Elsland? That land is protected by the powerful force of the Old One. It was now revealed that the Queen of Elsland is a Dragorin, but what if she was an ancient dragon? We wouldn’t have been able to confront it. We wouldn’t have been able to even set foot in her land.”</p>
<p>I swallowed some saliva, then continued.</p>
<p>“Ultimately, we must take responsibility for this. Either involve the higher Dooms to help alleviate the burden placed on me or use other means to support me if that is impossible. Only then can we achieve a desired outcome. Of course, the item I obtained this time was once owned by Doom Arukuda. However, it was lost a long time ago, and it has been purified by the Old One’s faction.”</p>
<p>I looked down at Caso, and his eyes were still shaking.</p>
<p>“If Doom Arukuda wanted to claim ownership, then he should have taken it back before it came into my hands. I didn't even know such an item existed until it came to me. I acquired it because of my past achievements, not because I specifically targeted Doom Arukuda’s belongings. It was an action taken to become stronger and meet your expectations. In the first place, Doom Arukuda cannot claim ownership. So, these are the two reasons why the item is mine.”</p>
<p>[You must have nothing to tell Doom Arukuda, right?]</p>
<p>“I am done.”</p>
<p>[But, you know… Huh?]</p>
<p>I wondered if it was because the ring was destroyed. The bastard’s messages and face were filled with astonishment and bewilderment.</p>
<p>[You are completely insane! You never intended to get permission from the start, did you? And you thought you could get away with it? How could you destroy Doom Arukuda’s item like that?!]</p>
<p>“...Shut the fuck up. What does Doom Kaos say? I want the verdict, the verdict!”</p>
<p>[You are in big trouble, Doom Man! It's a death sentence!]</p>
<p>[I know. Doom Man won’t fear death. But it won’t be easy to die. It will be an eternal hell for Doom Man, and you will end up begging for death. Immortality is not always a good thing. Then, good luck keeps dying. Condolences in advance… (｡◕ˇдˇ◕｡) ]</p>
<p>At that moment, legs with Ancient Dragon skulls on each knee came out through the curtain. The executioner was not Doom Arukuda. It was that guy… Doom Entegasto, who had been holding a grudge all this time! I sensed it was time to shout out the words I had prepared. Beyond the curtain, I yelled at the one at the top.</p>
<p>“Alright! I will prove I wasn’t wrong!”</p>
<p>Fuck.</p>
<p>[*Storage box]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Golden Armor has been removed.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Ra’s Sun Cape has been removed.]</p>
<p>Entegasto stood tall, just as he did during the previous meeting. His feet were on the lowest step where Lunea was, and his waist was straightened so that the tip of his head almost touched the curtain.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Ethereal Animal.]</p>
<p>Fzzz!</p>
<p>[Really? You are going against Doom Entegasto? You are in a desperate situation where even begging won’t help… You have really gone crazy!]</p>
<p>As the tension increased, the message was surprisingly helpful. I saw Doom Entegasto’s black helmet where messages appeared in the air. I could also see its deeply sunken eye sockets.</p>
<p>A crimson energy was burning deep within them. It was probably because I had reached a new level where I could sense Mana and manipulate internal structures freely. I definitely had made significant progress as I could feel the overwhelming power concentrated within Entegasto.</p>
<p>The moment it bent down to approach me, the execution began. It was coming! The huge hand engulfed the world in darkness and stretched toward me, with the sound of the wind carrying the curse’s energy.</p>
<p>He was trying to grab me like before, and the pressure that surrounded me like a net came rushing in first. I didn’t know before, but this was where its attack began!</p>
<p>[Ra’s Blessing has been activated. (Item, Ra’s Sun Cape)]</p>

<p>A blue streak of lightning climbed up my spear, following the lines of my body. I unfolded my wings and soared up into the sky.</p>
<p>Entegasto! If you thought I would be captured as easily as before, you were mistaken. I am more powerful now even without the activation of the Man Who Overcomes Adversity…</p>

<p>Chapter 420</p>
<p>The elastic force that numbed my wrist also broke through my defensive barrier. My field of vision was blocked by its hand, and its huge body was standing in front of me like a gigantic wall. However, I could clearly feel a sharp gaze beyond Doom Entegasto, within the area I could reach with my Sense.</p>
<p>It was incredibly powerful without even having to see it with my naked eye. That was when instinctive alarms rang throughout my body. A thought flashed through my mind, and goosebumps began to arise as I felt a sudden chill.</p>
<p>Woooong-</p>
<p>The pressure increased even more, and Doom Entegasto seemed to have noticed that it would need to exert greater force to entrap me than it did before!</p>
<p>[Warning: Silvanus’s Bracelet of Fertility is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Silvanus’s Bracelet of Fertility has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Item Equipment): 59 minutes 59 seconds]</p>
<p>That was one of the items that I had hastily stored away without extracting Mana from it. It had the effect of reducing my skill’s cooldown time.</p>
<p>Shattered fragments passed by me.</p>
<p>[Warning: Leave the Doom Entegasto’s area.]</p>
<p>Burning pain overwhelmed both of my eyes as if they were about to burst with heat. A high-pitched ringing began in my ears as well.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t stop. It was true that my entire body felt heavy due to the pressure pressing down on me. It hindered me from flapping my wings, swinging my Alpha and Gamma tails, and jabbing the spear. Although my natural speed and strength were locked down, I wasn’t entirely restrained either.</p>
<p>Ssssst. Zing-!</p>
<p>Sparks and lightning streaks scattered across. Doom Entegasto’s hand was now closing in, and the space narrowed. The pressure from its hand intensified even more.</p>
<p>[Warning: Samantabhadra's Lotus Helmet is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Nagini's Necklace is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Dionysus’s Horn is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Ra’s Sun Cape is in danger.]</p>
<p>Fuck. My vision was covered in a red hue as a blood vessel had burst in one eye. I changed the angle that I wielded the spear. When I turned my head, I saw blood gushing not only from one eye but also from my nose and mouth.</p>
<p>Even though the impact was lessened by the protective barrier, Doom Entegasto was indeed powerful to deliver such a shock. Its hand, just about to grab me, was vivid. Despite the severe headache, my instincts had heightened my Sense due to the impending danger.</p>
<p>Damn it! Why now!</p>
<p>[You have used Shiva’s Sword.]</p>
<p>[Cooldown time (Shiva’s Sword): - 60% (12 seconds)]</p>

<p>Nagini's Necklace - 5%</p>
<p>Anubis's Death Guide Ring - 5%</p>
<p>Samantabhadra's Lotus Helmet - 5%</p>
<p>Dionysus’s Horn - 5%]</p>
<p>I concentrated my strength on the movements as I spread my wings and tails. Explosion in a confined space!</p>
<p>Thud-!</p>
<p>The flames couldn’t escape anywhere within the area created by its hand and only swirled inside its palm. The world turned red. Its hand that had tried grabbing me was now trying to crush me by snubbing me. Its palm was above and right below me, forming a floor, walls, and ceiling.</p>
<p>The fire from Shiva’s Sword clung to those walls and both of my hands that were clutching the spear. I used the spear as a support and clenched my teeth, enduring the force.</p>
<p>Zing-!</p>
<p>[You have used Nagini's Necklace.]</p>
<p>The snake-like summoned creature didn’t last long.</p>
<p>[You have used Anubis's Death Guide Ring.]</p>
<p>The item with the death attribute didn’t inflict any damage on it either.</p>
<p>[You have used Ṛṣabha's Reverent Anklet.]</p>
<p>Thanks to the healing ability of the anklet, my vision in one eye was restored. However, it was only temporary as I realized there was a problem with my other eye. The tinnitus in my ears grew louder since the sound of raging flames didn’t subside.</p>
<p>Ugh… However, it was bearable. Besides holding on to the spear with all my strength, I used my wings to support my back and tail to stand still. The sense of being able to emit fire from my wings and tails felt as natural as if I had been born with it. Because of this, the flames in the confined space only intensified and did not diminish.</p>
<p>Why is the cooldown time not ending? 12 seconds has never felt so long.</p>
<p>A sudden thought crossed my mind that perhaps one of Doom Entegasto’s powers was affecting cooldown times, but that wasn’t the case. It was just exerting more strength.</p>
<p>Then, right after…</p>
<p>[You have used Shiva’s Sword.]</p>
<p>It exploded once more, and it flinched its grip for the first time.</p>
<p>Why the hell hasn’t Forerunner activated yet?</p>
<p>If I could enhance Odin’s Wrath into Odin’s Thunderstorm, then I would have done something more right now!</p>
<p>I suddenly became very dizzy, so I clenched my teeth tight. An intangible pressure was concentrated on my head.</p>
<p>Something fell, and it was the fragments of my destroyed items. Considering that the sensation of the chain around my neck was gone, the necklace must have been broken as well. Then, a useless message appeared.</p>
<p>[Samantabhadra's Lotus Helmet has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>[Nagini's Necklace has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>[Cooldown time (Shiva’s Sword): - 50% (15 seconds)]</p>
<p>[Warning: Ṛṣabha's Reverent Anklet is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Lunea’s Light is in danger.]</p>
<p>The number of times the hand that had been forming walls in all directions was flinching increased. Now was the perfect time as the flames from Shiva’s Sword had filled the entire area with scorching flames. On top of that, Doom Entegasto wouldn’t be able to tolerate the lightning bolts from the spear.</p>
<p>Therefore, I believed that this would work. I brushed away any doubts I had. I tightly grasped the Thunder Spear, and my arm muscles writhed like snakes. Flames clung onto the spear once more.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The overlapping pressure had clearly become unbearable. My vision had been obstructed a while ago, but now it was almost impossible to distinguish anything with the naked eye. Everything was red.</p>
<p>The blue aura from the lightning streaks couldn’t reveal its true color in the crimson world. There were only the searing movements in the air. Therefore, there was no way the Dooms could see the blood I had vomited several times. Or it might have evaporated immediately due to extreme heat.</p>
<p>I was feeling utterly devastated, but there was one thing that kept me going. The blazing movement was caused by Entegasto’s grip wavering.</p>
<p>Therefore, there were two possibilities. Either Entegasto would succeed in grasping me, or it would try a different approach.</p>
<p>So… So…!</p>
<p>[You have used Shiva’s Sword.]</p>
<p>I somehow managed to unfold my wings and tails and smacked the surroundings… As soon as I pierced the ceiling with the spear, the turbulence intensified to the point that it shifted the center of my body toward one side. A torrent of flames was definitely forming as the accumulated flames escaped through some gap all at once.</p>
<p>A crack in its power?</p>
<p>My eyes widened. I also needed to ride the torrent and escape, but my body felt heavy.</p>
<p>Right after that, I threw my body in that direction. When I felt the pressure, which had been condensed as much as the flames, loosening a bit, something hit my spine. There was a flash before my eyes, and I collided with something and bounced off.</p>
<p>Ah…</p>
<p>When I opened my eyes, I wasn’t on the staircase. Instead, I was lying not far from Lunea’s stairs. Lunea was alternately looking at me and up the stairs, following the huge figure of Entegasto, with terrified eyes.</p>
<p>However, Lunea was not looking at Entegasto. The fire was spreading from the spot where I fought against Entegasto, and the fire was engulfing the staircases one by one as if to burn the whole world.</p>
<p>Mount was busy running away with its binding ropes attached to it. Caso also tried to jump down to the bottom of the stairs, but all it could do was hang in the middle of the stairs due to the binding rope.</p>
<p>Lunea shifted its gaze toward me.</p>
<p>[Doom… Man… Are you not going to die…?]</p>
<p>It looked at me with dread, while widening its eyes in that tiny face.</p>
<p>The asshole’s glance was directed to the back behind me. I realized that I couldn’t avoid it, so I needed to prepare for the upcoming shock. Therefore, I added more strength to the fist holding the spear. Fortunately, I was holding on to it unconsciously.</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell how it happened, but the shock inflicted on me was indeed tremendous. When the impact that shook me back and forth stopped, one of my eyes burst without knowing how or when. It was fucking painful.</p>
<p>I looked up while adjusting my dislocated shoulder. Entegasto was powerful, but it also hadn’t shaken off the torrent of flames that had burst at the last moment. Its upper body was wrapped in fire.</p>
<p>[You have used the Punishment of the Moong Water God.]</p>
<p>[Your injuries have been significantly healed.]</p>
<p>[Cooldown time (Punishment of the Moong Water God): - 30% (21 seconds)]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Bone Ring that the Dead Revere - 30%]</p>
<p>On top of the Punishment of the Moong Water God, the regeneration speed in the Overlord section had been added. I quickly regained my lost eye. When I was able to exert strength in my shattered bones and crushed muscles, I could stand up.</p>
<p>At that time, Entegasto’s upper body was still engulfed in flames. I definitely saw its red muscles that had been exposed through the gaps of armor were now burnt black. It couldn’t avoid the burns of extreme heat either! It was not invincible!</p>
<p>[You have inflicted a powerful blow on the target.]</p>
<p>Nice.</p>
<p>Starting with Night Eye and Explorer, the areas inside me in charge of the trait Forerunner reacted all at once. I had been waiting for Forerunner as it leaped my Agility to the ultimate level of the Overlord section. It felt like the Forerunner was screaming at me to take it out.</p>
<p>However, it was clear that due to Entegasto’s Power, the area responsible for Forerunner was showing a different reaction than usual. This was how Entegasto had been blocking the activation of the Man Who Overcomes and Adversity before.</p>
<p>[Your Power Resistance is insufficient.]</p>
<p>[Power Resistance: 60%]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Unique Power ‘?’ has been interfering with the trait Forerunner.]</p>
<p>Despite this, I successfully activated Forerunner. Entegasto didn’t manage to block it completely, thanks to my Power Resistance.</p>
<p>[Forerunner has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Duration of Forerunner has significantly reduced.]</p>
<p>[Duration (Forerunner): - 90% (2 hours 24 minutes)]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Unique Power ‘?’ - 90%]</p>
<p>When the power that could throw me to somewhere wriggled throughout my body, the flames clinging to Entegasto had evaporated like a lie. The charred muscles regained their red color in an instant. Instead, the flames that had briefly filled the place with red had now completely vanished. Instead, the flickering of the flames was now concentrated within Entegasto’s helmet, inside its eye sockets, swaying with more intense movements.</p>
<p>The anger contained within seemed to fall directly on me. I didn’t know what kind of Power it would unleash, but there was no need to be shaking.</p>
<p>“You seem weaker than before, Entegasto,” I taunted, looking up to break the silence. I hadn’t even started yet.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the activation of Forerunner was only the first awakening. If Sensitive activated, then that was the second awakening. Then, the third awakening was when the Man Who Overcomes Adversity came into effect. Only then did the real battle begin in its full form.</p>
<p>I had to detect the full extent of Entegasto’s ability before that. Therefore, I had to resist as much as possible with the determination to bring it down! I didn’t want to admit it…but this was the stage for me to prove my potential to Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 421</p>
<p>From the moment I soared up in the sky, I could clearly see Entegasto’s current condition. Black armor pieces covered its body, but a majority of its skin was still exposed. Muscles that were wrapped around its face were visible through the gaps in the helmet that revealed its eye sockets, and muscles were tightly stretched between the armor pieces. The muscle fibers were gathered to form masses, and they appeared as if a reddish ocean current was moving</p>
<p>However, the exposed parts of its skin were just a tip of the iceberg. Its shoulder had many gaps to the point that I was surprised that the armor pieces had not fallen off.</p>
<p>Moreover, there was not even a single piece of armor left in the chest area. Skin, muscles, and ribs were all gone, leaving a gaping hole. On top of that, I could see its massive heart pounding vigorously.</p>
<p>In addition, the crimson energy of its Power continuously flowed from the wound and disappeared in all directions. This was clear evidence that Entegasto was suffering from its injuries.</p>
<p>The battle between Entegasto and Saint Jayden took place a long time ago, but its wounds looked as fresh as if the fight had just ended.</p>
<p>Sheeeeek-!</p>
<p>Its eyes that were looking down at me flashed, but I had already reached the level of its chin. The chin was the closest part of its face I could approach, and I thrust my spear at it quickly, adding in my flight momentum as well.</p>
<p>Zing-!</p>
<p>The spear hit the target accurately. Although lightning streaks struck it and scattered first, the tip of the spear actually touched its chin, where a piece of the helmet was missing. The spearhead penetrated its muscles, and it was pushed in as if it was sucked into a black hole. As my fist was pulled into its muscle, I felt resistance.</p>
<p>I then retrieved the spear. Although it was a tiny scar, the size of its sweat gland, there was definitely a trace left on its chin. However, it recovered instantly.</p>
<p>[The negative effect, ‘Chaos,’ has been applied.]</p>
<p>[The negative effect, ‘Harbinger of Death,’ has been doubled.]</p>
<p>Immediately I felt a stinging sensation on both my ankles, and it soon aggravated into extreme pain. It was from an evil spirit. I had totally forgotten about the faces of the Seventh and Eighth Virtue sisters. Only their faces appeared without necks and bodies. Both of them were glaring at me with their eyes filled with intense resentment.</p>
<p>However, they were not actual souls. They were just illusions, but the damage they inflicted on me was real.</p>
<p>At the moment the two faces simultaneously turned their heads, the force pulling me down became immense. The two faces that were attached to my ankles remained the same, but my surroundings spun crazily. I struck at them with Alpha and Gamma. Although they couldn’t crush the skulls or burn the faces with flames, it worked to a certain extent as they soon disappeared. I managed to get my balance immediately before hitting the ground, and the background stopped spinning.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I realized that both of my ankles were so severely injured to the point they were non-functional. Of course, I couldn’t afford to take a look at them.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Punishment of the Moong Water God): 19 seconds]</p>
<p>Its hand was coming down at me again, and this time, it didn’t seem to intend to grab me. That was why all sorts of evil spirits were pouring out from its gigantic outstretched hand. The faces of the Seventh and Eighth Virtues were there as well.</p>
<p>All of them were the souls of the deceased that I killed. Each face had bloody tears flowing down their eyes, filled with resentment and agony. Their mouths were wide open as if they were screaming, and their tongues were writhing.</p>
<p>However, there were also the faces of people I had not killed, which made my skin crawl. Yeon-Hee, Jonathan, Joshua, Seong-Il, my parents, and faces that I never wanted to see even in my dreams. Dozens of them were pouring out all at once. The sound of their onslaught was similar to the sound one made when they were choking or strangling.</p>
<p>Aargh. Aaaargh.</p>
<p>Aaaaaaargh-</p>
<p>I wanted to use Lunea’s Light, but I stopped myself. I unfolded and flapped my wings with a disgusting feeling. It was not a big deal that I couldn’t use my legs as the wings were a part of my body as well.</p>
<p>Argh!</p>
<p>[The negative effect, ‘Harbinger of Death,’ has been tripled.]</p>
<p>Ugh. I thought I had narrowly avoided it, but that was not true. A sudden shock struck my back, and a light flashed in front of me. When I came to my senses, I was stuck in the ground. My entire face felt heavy, and my broken teeth were mixed in the blood.</p>
<p>As I leaped to the side by striking the ground with my three tails, an explosion erupted where I had collapsed. The blast wave pushed me away once more, but it wasn’t over yet.</p>
<p>It appeared that this was just the beginning of Entegasto’s offensive. Illusions of evil spirits poured out non-stop from its palm, and each one had the attribute of death. In addition to the unbearable pain in my damaged back and ankles, a curse was seeping in and preventing regeneration.</p>
<p>Therefore, I needed to run away somehow.</p>
<p>[Please! Please go to hell, Doom Man! Everyone is going to die if you keep doing this! Pleaseeeee-!]</p>
<p>At one point, the bastard’s messages shook before my eyes. I managed to land a hit on Entegasto while dodging the illusions of the evil spirits, but Sensitive had not been activated yet so I found myself getting slammed to the ground again.</p>
<p>This time, I struck the ground not only with my tail but also with my hands and wings. As I soared at an angle, the wind filled with the smell of blood brushed past me.</p>
<p>Doom Entegasto was injured, but it indeed deserved its title and its close rank to Doom Kaos. It continued to stand still even while it had continuously attacked me with evil spirits. It had only slightly adjusted the direction of its palm. Even now, its offensive maneuvers had not stopped.</p>
<p>Damn it. Damn it! How strong is this asshole?</p>
<p>Every time it switched direction, a dangerous illusion grazed past me. However, when something came straight for my abdomen, I knew I wouldn’t be able to avoid it. Therefore, all my Strength was focused on the point of impact. Forerunner alone was not enough. I needed the activation of Sensitive…</p>
<p>“Argh!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Warning: Odin’s Golden Armor is in danger.]</p>

<p>The messages that suddenly came to my mind were fragments of memories. They were things I saw just before my memory was momentarily cut off during the crash. Not much time had passed as the Punishment of the Moong Water God had not been recharged yet.</p>
<p>Even then, the evil spirits were flying with their mouths wide open toward me.</p>
<p>[You have used Lunea’s Light.]</p>

<p>[The negative effect, ‘Harbinger of Death (quintupled),’ has been removed.]</p>
<p>The illusion disappeared immediately, and the hideous faces turned into projectiles that were condensed with red energy. That was their true form. Although it was a relief that I no longer had to see them, I felt something icky. I wasn’t certain if I could withstand Entegasto with only a sword and lightning power, but it wasn’t time to hesitate.</p>
<p>I formed the trajectory of Devi’s Sword with me in the center and spun the lighting bolts as well.</p>
<p>[*Storage box]</p>
<p>[Lunea’s Light has been added.]</p>
<p>I put some items in my inventory before forgetting about it. I was struggling to dodge the projectiles with my injured body, and Devi’s Sword and Odin’s Wrath were definitely not enough.</p>
<p>I was exposed again as a few projectiles quickly offset the barrier I had created. I managed to avoid the ones I thought I could, but the problem were the ones that I couldn’t help but get hit by. One of them suddenly pierced through my sensory net and appeared out of nowhere, so it was useless to change direction.</p>
<p>I must have fallen again like a puppet with a severed string.</p>
<p>[Warning: Ra’s Sun Cape is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Odin’s Golden Armor is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>[Warning: Zeus’s Thunder Spear is in danger.]</p>
<p>At that time, the negative effect of ‘Harbinger of Death,’ which I had reset, became tripled again, and the fucking ‘Chaos’ clung to me as well.</p>
<p>However…the attack suddenly stopped. I wondered if Doom Kaos had stopped the fight, or if I had missed a message, but I couldn’t see anyone including the jerk Lunea, Caso, and Mount. I couldn’t let this reprieve pass in vain.</p>
<p>I started by unleashing the recharged Punishment of the Moong Water God. Although the powerful death energy had blocked my regeneration, this would be temporarily effective in treating my wounds.</p>
<p>At the same time, I put Odin’s Golden Armor in the inventory. While I was making a painful decision about Ra’s Sun Cape, I suddenly realized that perhaps Entegasto needed time for maintenance. If I were him, then I would have waited for time to recharge without attacking more to avoid the situation of the Man Who Overcomes Adverisity’s activation. Moreover, I was resistant to physical damage.</p>
<p>Thus, the attack it had to exert on me was obvious. It was waiting to complete the Contempt of the Weak. Nonetheless, at that moment…</p>
<p>Woooong-</p>
<p>I felt a familiar flow from it. A rough, strong, and controlled flow surged dramatically toward the skulls of ancient dragons attached to its knee pads. It was the same phenomenon that occurred when those who had awakened as a skeletal dragon or Dragorin exhaled their breath. Of course, their strength and speed were incomparable to them.</p>
<p>The skulls of the ancient dragons, which were now merely material, moved as if they had regained life. That was when I realized Entegasto’s intention. It was confident that it couldn’t complete the Contempt of the Weak. Perhaps it was because the recharging time was too long to try right away.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was preparing a powerful strike that could inflict damage on me even if I activated the Man Who Overcomes Adversity! It wanted to kill me as soon as I completed my true form with the activation of all the items and traits I had.</p>
<p>Entegasto had missed two chances. It couldn’t trap me in its grasp, nor could it complete the Contempt of the Weak. That was why it decided to move again! It already gave me goosebumps, and the chilling sense of crisis permeated my bones. My thoughts flowed quickly as if death was just around the corner.</p>
<p>The attack that would burst from the two ancient dragon skulls had a formidable power that I had never experienced before. If I took the damage head on, then Ra’s Sun Cape would be destroyed. Without the cape, I lacked Power Resistance. To continue confronting Entegasto, I needed to pay Ra’s Sun Cape as a participation fee.</p>
<p>I decided to fight!</p>
<p>Dddd- Dddddddd-</p>
<p>The jaw bones of the ancient dragons widened as if they were screaming. The red energy filling my entire field of vision burst out.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The motherfucker Lunea once said that hell will feel like an eternity. The pain was terrible and crushed me. It shattered me into pieces, burned me, and devoured me. At one point, I didn’t even have the organs left to scream.</p>
<p>[The Man Who Overcomes Adversity has been activated.]</p>
<p>[You have leveled up. Change: Overlord (Lv.641) → Overlord (Lv. 720)]</p>
<p>[All skill classes and traits’ proficiency has leveled up.]</p>
<p>[All of your injuries have been healed.]</p>
<p>[All negative effects have been removed.]</p>
<p>[The duration of the trait the Man Who Overcomes Adversity has significantly declined.]</p>
<p>[Duration (Man Who Overcomes Adversity): - 90% (2 hours 24 minutes)]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Unique Power ‘?’ - 90%]</p>
<p>The pain washed away like a lie as the Man Who Overcomes Adversity had activated, but it was only temporary. The ongoing pain was unbearable and hard to escape. Even after Entegasto’s attack stopped, the screaming that had been echoing in my head for a long time didn’t disappear.</p>
<p>[Ra’s Sun Cape has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>The cape was ripped apart into pieces.</p>
<p>[Your injuries have not been recovered due to Doom Entegasto’s Unique Power ‘?’]</p>
<p>My previously healing wounds stopped recovering. I took out the Thunder Spear I had placed in the storage box. The hand gripping the spear also had exposed bones as the recovery halted.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the large body of Entegasto that had been standing from the bottom stairs to the top in front of the curtain had vanished. Then, a shadow slightly larger than me walked out from the curtain with a black sword in its hand.</p>
<p>Entegasto!</p>
<p>Its heart no longer existed in its chest. The sword that was glaring with red energy was its heart, and the sound echoing from the blade was like the solemn drumming of a ritual. I dove toward that sound.</p>
<p>Is this fair now? Entegasto!</p>
<p>I rushed toward the cursed sword’s hum, which was also the sound of its heart…</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 422</p>
<p>Proficiency LV. 9.</p>
<p>The two skills that had reached their ultimate limit were Odin’s Wrath and Odin’s Ethereal Animal. Lightning power was concentrated at the tip of the spear, and the blazing flames grew even larger, pouring out like a tsunami toward Entegasto.</p>
<p>At that moment, Entegasto also increased its speed and dove into the fire that was flickering with lightning, just as I jumped into it before. After it raised a sword, the flames parted as if they were the ocean. The divided blaze shattered into embers like a swarm of burning flies, as soon as Entegasto put its sword down. I couldn’t afford to flap my wings and whip my tails to grow the flame again.</p>
<p>Although it was only slightly larger than me, its presence remained unchanged. It appeared as if it still had the gigantic shadow it used to have. With such an overwhelming momentum, it pierced through space in an instant, tearing through the flames.</p>
<p>I thrust my spear towards it, and brilliant blue light flashed. Its new form suddenly disappeared. Then, it was behind me. I felt something rushing at me, so I quickly bent my waist. The echo from there was not simply the sound of cutting through the air.</p>
<p>I hastily retrieved my spear while maintaining a bent posture and held it with both hands. I used it as a support to resist the force from above. Within a second, the lightning energy formed a barrier there. A scream burst from my tightly clenched muscles, and the injured parts were burning with pain.</p>
<p>As Entegasto’s gaze looked down on me, its sword and my spear collided. I instinctively clenched my teeth. Its sword spread the energy of death at the point of collision, and they began to cling to me.</p>
<p>However, I did not collapse. I successfully pushed back its attack by using the force of striking the ground with my wings, and it showed a brief gap. From this distance, Entegasto wouldn’t be able to avoid my strike!</p>
<p>[You have used Indra’s Sword.]</p>
<p>However, it was too high for me.</p>
<p>[Indra’s Sword has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>Entegasto appeared, slicing the lightning bolt embedded in it with its sword. Then, it fell toward me, vertically drawing its sword. It was swinging down the sword from high above, exactly at me. According to my sensory network, its power was formidable from the sky, but there were other sources of strength surging up from the ground.</p>
<p>Compression! It was trying to trap me just as he had done with its own grip before. A message broke through for a moment, but vanished in a blink of an eye.</p>
<p>[Warning: Leave the territory of Doom Entegasto.]</p>
<p>I barely escaped from its realm. Things in between the compressed space didn’t pop, but the moment the area became highly compressed, a vast region distorted to the point that it was visible even to the naked eye. Therefore, the scene of Entegasto changing direction and sprinting toward me looked shaky.</p>
<p>However, the massive darkness pouring in still felt vivid to my sensory network. An evil emperor was throwing itself from the throne to hell… It was coming at me again!</p>
<p>There was still distance left to collide directly with it, but the illusion it had released was closing the distance at a frightening speed. Its body was clearly flying from there, so I mistook the huge phantom that came out of its armor as an illusion.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that was not true as there was no negative effect attached.</p>
<p>The specter’s sword was as large as its black body. It swung not to slash me, but to crush and burst me. On the back of the evil spirit, Entegasto was swinging a sword as well. There was no need to distinguish which one was real as both of them were.</p>
<p>The first shock came from the spirit swinging its sword, and the second shock occurred when the bastard lunged in as soon as the spirit disappeared. Although my Health had reached its ultimate level, I still felt pain. But thanks to the ultimate level, I managed to bear the agony.</p>
<p>I twisted my body as I gained consciousness for a short period. As expected, the asshole’s leg slammed down onto the spot where I had been lying. I swept its leg away with my tail and raised my spear towards the bastard’s face coming forward. I interfered with its staggering gait by shooting out lightning bolts, preventing it from coming closer.</p>
<p>Zap-!</p>
<p>The lightning bolts exploded at a point on the motherfukcer’s helmet where it first made contact. Right after that, my spearhead, which had my ultimate Strength and Agility imbued into it, struck its helmet. Its head bent backward, and the evil spirit, with its head bent in the same way, bounced out and entered the bastard’s body again.f𝚛e𝚎𝙬𝑒𝚋𝚗𝚘ѵ𝐞𝒍. c𝐨𝙢</p>
<p>However, my hard-won offensive did not last long. Entegasto’s sword began to ring again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Its sword was fucking annoying. The vibrations bursting out of it were truly abhorrent. Its power was tremendous since it was made of its heart.</p>
<p>On top of that, the evil spirit that jumped out whenever the bastard carried out an attack was disgusting. Its ability to freely use its own spiritual body was also a piece of evidence that this bastard was ranked above me.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I had inflicted injuries on it. Just as there wasn’t a single intact part of my body, the accumulated damage on the bastard was significant. I was aiming for one spot, the edge of its neck. It was originally hidden by the helmet, but a piece of it had fallen off, revealing my target.</p>
<p>If I couldn’t destroy its sword, which was also its heart, then I had to thrust into its neck. There was no skin or muscle there anyway as only bone and blood-red energy were connected like blood vessels.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Man Who Overcomes Adversity): 59 minutes 21 seconds]</p>
<p>I took advantage of a brief gap to quickly check the remaining time. It had only been an hour and a half since I started confronting this asshole, but it felt like it had been days. That could have been true. The time in the mainland was difficult to apply here as the bastard and I were in the realm of the ultimate.</p>
<p>Even now, as we were watching each other from a distance that was created due to the recent collision, I kept my Sense at its peak since its attacks were unexpected. I needed to find the perfect time to prove my capability to Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>The bastard was no different. Its eyes no longer squirmed with rage, and the beating sound of the sword that rang fiercely at regular intervals had now become heavy and subsided. It pounded loudly only when it was attacking.</p>
<p>Right now!</p>
<p>Woooong-</p>
<p>The black armor with the attached bones of ancient dragons emerged, and the giant evil spirit inside the bastard appeared as well. When both of them swung their swords, countless intangible swords poured down at once. The powerful force tried to confine me, but it was not as strong as it was at the beginning.</p>
<p>However, the same went for me. Then, the message that made me calculate until the end popped up again.</p>
<p>[Warning: Zeus’s Thunder Spear is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>Damn it. I couldn’t afford to lose my spear as well since I had already paid the participation fee with Ra’s Sun Cape. I put the spear back into my inventory and threw myself forward. The weight that had filled my hand vanished.</p>
<p>I dodged the first attack, but the second attack followed at the spot where I evaded. The sword swung horizontally by the evil spirit filled my vision and approached me in a huge and transparent shape, but I no longer had the spear to counter it. It definitely had the shape of a sword, but it was as gigantic as a house. It was no different than a huge wall flying towards me, and I needed to take the impact.</p>
<p>I wrapped my left arm with Alpha and my right arm with Gamma. I set the middle tail, Beta, on the ground as a support. Then, I spread my wings to their maximum size.</p>
<p>Baaam!</p>
<p>Screams echoed from every joint, but a different sound came from my lips.</p>
<p>“Ugh.”</p>
<p>A large amount of blood, that I couldn’t bear to hold in, came out of my mouth. I tolerated the first blow, but the second attack was right before my eyes. I suddenly had the intuition that this could kill me.</p>
<p>This attack was weird as it was different from the other ones. As the evil spirit returned into Entegasto’s form and the cruel sword of the bastard hovered before my neck, the vibration persisted relentlessly beyond a solitary sound.</p>
<p>If its intention was to control my mind, then it was making a grave mistake. Doom Dejire was a low-ranking lord, but I had a history of successfully escaping the suffocating mental realm it had created. However, the feeling that it would drop me into a hell hole vanished in an instant.</p>
<p>Moments after, my mind had been disturbed. The bastard’s blade glinted menacingly, poised to end my life before my very eyes. My instinct kicked in, enabling me to withstand the overwhelming pressure. Though I managed to block the attack with both hands, the blade still bore down on me violently.</p>
<p>I was forced backward. Although I managed to repel the invisible hand reaching for my ankle with the flames of my tail, the bastard’s primary attack had already landed. Death seemed inevitable, and I thought its blade would slowly close in on my neck.</p>
<p>I was immortal, so I was not afraid of death. I could replay this battle countless times and use my experience to better face the evil spirit and the bastard in future fights. However, I had no intention of meeting my end with grace at this moment. I needed to make it harder for it to kill me.</p>
<p>I was pissed that Doom Kaos had not given me the confirmation to remain as a Doom. I had even lost Ra’s Sun Cape!</p>
<p>But then, something happened. A wave of anger, which was more intense than mine, emanated from its helmet. The force of its blade pushing toward me had weakened gradually. When it eventually reached the point that I could push back, the bastard emitted a powerful sense of frustration and helplessness. It wasn’t trembling its limbs uncontrollably, but I could tell by seeing Entegasto looking up at the curtain.</p>
<p>I could sense that its face was contorted hideously inside the helmet.</p>
<p>[Doom Mount has given up its position.]</p>
<p>[You have inherited Doom Mount’s position.]</p>
<p>The message continued.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 423</p>
<p>After the tension subsided, excruciating pain overwhelmed me. Bone was exposed throughout most of my body. The left radius (the outer bone of the forearm) was especially prominent. It had broken and pierced through my skin. I had to consciously bear my weight on my legs. My internal organs felt as if they were burning and twisting violently, and a sudden surge of fatigue weighed heavily on my shoulders.</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto’s Power ‘?’ has been deactivated.]</p>
<p>From then on, I didn’t need to use healing skills as long as my eyeballs were still intact. My protruding bones found their way back to their original positions, and muscles quickly attached to them, followed by skin covering them.</p>
<p>My regeneration occurred quickly. With such healing power, minor injuries or burns would be recovered immediately. The exhaustion that had been urging me to sit down vanished in an instant. My body felt light again.</p>
<p>I checked Entegasto. It was still looking up from a distance where it had been pushed back to, and its small wounds had disappeared as well. However, the biggest injury around its neck was still there. The bone was still exposed. There had been flesh covering the bone before I exerted my power on it.</p>
<p>Even if it was irreversible, it was supposed to be healed now that the battle was over. Nonetheless, it appeared that some limitation was preventing the recovery of a critical injury.</p>
<p>Its armor was also in bad shape as the clash had caused more cracks and aggravated the damage. It turned out that I wasn’t the only one who had paid the participation fee. In fact, its losses were greater. Therefore, I couldn’t help but have a bitter smile crossing my lips.</p>
<p>Eventually, the sword it was holding vanished in a blink of an eye. The pounding sound that came from the sword’s vibration was now echoing from its heart. It then turned its head toward me and looked at me with a resentful gaze for quite some time.</p>
<p>However, no fear was conveyed. Although it was ranked higher than me now, it would be different next time. By then, it would have to confront me with even worse damage.</p>
<p>Then, it leapt up the stairs and disappeared behind the curtain. Nevertheless, it felt like its glance was lingering like an afterimage. When that feeling left, I sensed Lunea and others being forcibly brought in.</p>
<p>The space began to expand, and they were all pulled into the staircase. Lunea was on the lowest, Caso on the one above her, and my position since the battle ended was the fifth staircase from the top.</p>
<p>The force that pulled in Mount was also formed like this. The bindings that blocked the movements of Mount were interwoven like chains. However, a movement to a certain extent was possible that it lowered its head as soon as it saw me.</p>
<p>Half of its frightened face was exposed as the fur that had been covering it was quite scorched. Its cold gaze from before had completely vanished. It was as docile as Yeon-Hee’s Kcihpos. Dealing with this guy, who had given up its position, would be the next task to complete.</p>
<p>Roaaaar! Thump-!</p>
<p>I jumped up to the fourth staircase, which had now become my spot. It was just below the curtain. Only one more step remained to the next staircase obscured by the curtain, the unknown territory where Entegasto was.</p>
<p>From there, I could see all the lower Dooms at once. The aftermath of the battle had remained for the bastard Lunea as well. It was swaying unsteadily, unable to find its balance. It didn’t know where to look, so it decided to lower its head. It was so tiny that if I were to slap it with my palm, not only its face but its entire body would burst at once.</p>
<p>[...Uh, so… Umm… So… What I want to say is…mmm… Congratulations…]</p>
<p>However, it was only for a moment that its message appeared intermittently.</p>
<p>[Congratulations! I, Lunea, am truly touched!]</p>
<p>[Doom Mount must remember this day and will always have a sense of awe. There is nothing to be ashamed of. I would have done the same as Doom Mount. Let’s not forget. It is a blessing for all our lords that Doom Man is so strong. Right? Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha. Ha…]</p>
<p>It flew annoyingly like a tiny fly.</p>
<p>[ ( ŏ ӟ ŏ)੭~♡ With respect and love, to Doom Man.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I shouldn’t have been concerned with such nonsense. There were messages that suddenly popped up without any reaction from any areas where Night Eye or Explorer were. It was no longer difficult for me to distinguish between the remaining system in me and Lunea’s voice that was sent by Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>[Your Almighty Master, Doom Kaos’s command has been modified.]</p>
<p>[Find One More Dragorin ‘Red,’ and Remove It. (Command)]</p>
<p>[Defeat the Great Red (Command)</p>
<p>The Great Red has also suffered severe injuries during the battle against Doom Entegasto. Since then, the Great Red has been in a long slumber, and its whereabouts are unknown. Nevertheless, waking the Great Red will not be a difficult task. Eliminate the remaining blood relations of the Great Red to make it wake up by itself. Then, defeat it.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that the seal left by the Great Red to the lower lords is weakening. In other words, it has not recovered from the injury yet! Nonetheless, it would be hard for you to confront it directly even if it is in such a state. Therefore, secure additional relics from the old battlefield. Retrieving them will be of great help to you.</p>
<p>If you succeed: You will be able to unlock your Unique Power. You will receive an opportunity to challenge the hierarchy towards the superior lord, Doom Entegasto. Also, the attack of the Old One’s Corps on your mainland will be completely blocked by the powerful force that your Master will create.</p>
<p>(* If you succeed in challenging the higher lord, the dimensions held by Doom Entegasto will become yours as well.)</p>
<p>If you fail: Your master will be greatly disappointed in you.</p>
<p>(* Your master will pay more attention to Doom Entegasto’s voice. You will face unpredictable punishments.)</p>
<p>[An additional command has arrived from your master, Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>[Speed Up the Conquest (Command)</p>
<p>Your Master is satisfied with the war situation. Your human corps is powerful, and your master sees a lot of potential from your group, just as you have shown in the fight against Doom Entegasto.</p>
<p>Speed up the conquest and occupy the entire Greenwood Continent within one hundred days, or expand the battlefield to another continent and achieve the same results as you have now. Keep in mind that the species of other continents are inherently stronger than the natives of Greenwood.</p>
<p>If you succeed: Your master will praise you and your human corps, and then it will build a Demon Castle in the area of your choice.</p>
<p>(* The Demon Castle will be protected by the powerful force that your master will create.)</p>
<p>If you fail: The opportunity will go to the corps of the other Dooms.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Ongoing commands</p>
<p>1. Defeat the Great Red.</p>
<p>2. Speed Up the Conquest.]</p>
<p>I wondered if Doom Kaos had originally planned to entrust the Great Red to Entegasto. Or if Doom Arukuda or Doom Kaos itself would have intended to take action.</p>
<p>Anyway, dealing with the Great Red, the Saint Jayden, was now my responsibility. The reward for doing so was more than what I could ask for.</p>
<p>I wasn’t talking about the additional Unique Power that was being thrown at me like bait. The opportunity to challenge Entegasto again and the fact that Doom Kaos would completely block attacks on my mainland meant a lot. They would eliminate two of my biggest concerns. Of course, I was sure that they wouldn’t do anything to my mainland even if I failed.</p>
<p>As you could tell, the carrot offered by Doom Kaos was bigger than the whip. The same was true for the additional command, and Doom Kaos seemed to have been moved by the previous fight as if I had met its expectations. It was clear even after checking it again.</p>
<p>[Secure additional relics from the old battlefield. Retrieving them will be of great help to you.]</p>
<p>It was explicitly telling me to extract Mana from the relics from the War of New Devil. This implied that we no longer had to argue over the higher Dooms’ belongings. Doom Arukuda and Entegasto might have complained and were growing more rebellious, but they couldn’t do much.</p>
<p>Entegasto had to stop the attack just before seeing the end with me. Arukuda hadn’t come down to the bottom staircase even after the execution was suspended.</p>
<p>This was a space that operated like Jeonil Club, an absolute ruler’s realm. Despite Doom Kaos’s increasing expectations and its actions in giving me more authority, Doom Entegasto, and Arukuda would still have been unable to challenge the fucking ruler.</p>
<p>Just wait, Entegasto. The day we face off again is not far off.</p>
<p>The surroundings were quiet, and the air around me was heavy. The oppressive atmosphere beyond the curtain was pressing down on me, and I could feel the subdued mood of Mount and Caso from below. Thus, the damn Lunea was the only noisy one.</p>
<p>[I am so jealous~ Doom Man. Did my previous advice help you? It was information I found out at the risk of danger. From now on, I, Lunea, will also follow your example and help change the world. Please look forward to it. Hehehe!]</p>
<p>“Lunea…”</p>
<p>Lunea seemed to have heard my mumbling.</p>
<p>[It’s not Lunea. It’s Lu-ne-ah. Lu-ne-ah! Well, that doesn’t matter. Call me whatever you like. Yes, yes. I’m not Lu-ne-ah. I’m Lunea.]</p>
<p>Lunea was someone that the absolute being of this space brought in. It must have received the status of a lord because Doom Kaos had considered it to be useful.</p>
<p>Doom Insectum had died horribly, and Entegasto was severely injured. Even if it was Doom Kaos, it wouldn’t have been able to ignore the consumption of power. Hence, it would never tolerate me killing that bastard Lunea and would inflict penalties on me by destroying my mainland.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to admit that there was no way to handle Lunea and its annoying messages for now. Nonetheless, now that Doom Kaos was empowering me, there was still unfinished business to take care of.</p>
<p>“I have a question, my lord!”</p>
<p>I shouted towards the curtain.</p>
<p>“There are issues that Lunea and I have not resolved yet. Lunea told me that you have the ‘Book of Death Volume 1!”</p>
<p>[W…what the hell are you talking about right now…?]</p>
<p>“But the Book of Death Volume 1 was an item that I was supposed to receive as a price of the truce with the Barba Corps in the Final Stage. Because of that truce, many of the Barba Corps were able to survive from me.”</p>
<p>[W…Why… Why are you bringing up something that is already over…? You shouldn't mention something like this! I, Lu… Lunea, really wanted to stay close to you, Doom Man! Do you really have to do this now? ٩(๑`н´๑)۶ ]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 424</p>
<p>“The situation was so urgent in the Final Stage that I couldn’t confirm if Lunea had taken the item on my behalf or not. After the Final Stage, the situation has remained unchanged. I have been putting in lots of effort to bring about the present circumstances.”</p>
<p>Lunea clenched its tiny teeth, but I ignored it and continued.</p>
<p>“I thought that Lunea would have handed it over to me if it took it. Since there was no mention of it even after Lunea joined as a Doom under your direct command, I never even imagined that Lunea would have received it. But not long ago, Lunea revealed the truth it had been hiding, saying that you allowed it to keep it. If you authorized that to happen, then I will accept it.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“However, Lunea has committed a great sin against me. It deceived me. It had several opportunities to tell me the truth, but it didn’t. I cannot bear the anger when I think that it must have been lying and laughing at me secretly. My lord! Lunea must pay the price for deceiving me here. Also, if it is not true that you allowed Lunea to take the Book of Death, then its crime is worthy of the death penalty. Please punish Lunea!”</p>
<p>[D…death penalty? ( ｰ̀дｰ́ ) That’s not even funny. Shut your mouth if you know nothing. Our Almighty Master recognized my achievement with that~! I have fulfilled Master’s order! Unlike someone who is hella slow.]</p>
<p>[Isn’t that right, Master?]</p>
<p>Lunea refuted me immediately. The surprise on its face vanished, replaced by an arrogant demeanor.</p>
<p>It was an order…?</p>
<p>Well, I wasn’t the only one who had the freedom to act among all the Dooms. Lunea was also carrying out orders. I didn’t know where or what commands it carried out, but it appeared that it had received permission from Doom Kaos to take the Book of Death.</p>
<p>“However, that does not mean the crime of deceiving me has disappeared. Lunea would have revealed the truth at least when it joined us. It is also your messenger, but its messages are frivolous, contrary to your will. If you don’t punish it right now, then it will become more rude and arrogant in the future.”</p>
<p>[Frivolous? You shouldn’t say that. I can’t understand you no matter how much I try. It is just that you are too serious most of the time.]</p>
<p>[Master, Doom Man is tripping over something that is already over to get at me. He claims it is because I deceived him, but hey~ is that really true? He just wants to take the Book of Death. Doom Man is making up excuses right now!]</p>
<p>This bastard…</p>
<p>“I am now standing on the fourth step of the staircase, right below the curtain. Please establish the proper authority for my current position. Otherwise, what is the point of being where I am now? Would the lower lords have any hope and desire to challenge the higher ranks after this? I have only one wish: that it be made accountable for its crime of deceiving me. Certainly, if you tell me to tolerate it, then I will try to do so, but I hope you understand my sincerity, my lord.”</p>
<p>[Oh, dear… You are so temperamental. Do you think our Almighty Master would even bat an eye? Stop making up excuses and focus on thinking about how to fulfill our lord’s orders. If you need my help, feel free to tell me. I am busy, but I will help you when I can. You know? I am still filled with respect and love for you, Doom Man~♡♡♡ ]</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it seemed that Doom Kaos had said something to Lunea as it suddenly fell silent. Its gaze passed by me and fixed on the curtain. It was desperate, and it didn’t know what to do. Doom Kaos was paying attention to my words rather than the bastard’s nonsense.</p>
<p>[Master…! Doom Man’s words are not true. I have never deceived Doom Man. Please!]</p>
<p>The outline of the curtain was dark and calm like a tranquil lake. For the first time, I saw the curtain waver. When the movement intensified into a ripple, I looked at the bastard. Dread was filling its face. Lunea was trembling, not knowing what to do, and it was flapping its wings harder to regain its balance.</p>
<p>It was nothing more than a tiny creature, the size of a fist, struggling down the stairs. However, its fear spread throughout the lower Dooms.</p>
<p>Then, the bastard’s face started distorting. No, it actually became crumpled. It was the face of the Guide at the beginning of the Stage when the malice of Doom Kaos was revealed. From that hideous face, an instinctive hostility, which the bastard itself couldn’t handle, squirmed.</p>
<p>[Nothing will change even though you’re trying this hard. The Book of Death is mine! Lu-ne-ah’s! Do you get it?]</p>
<p>The curtain wavered once more. I realized that the phenomenon occurred whenever Doom Koas was conveying its thoughts to lower Dooms. It was now talking to me. Its judgment intuitively burrowed deep into my brain.</p>
<p>It was not telling me to retrieve the Book of Death, but it was more something like allowing flagellation. Doom Kaos had come to the conclusion that I could punish the sins of the bastard. Although I was prohibited from killing it, I had to be content with this.</p>
<p>From the beginning, I expected that it would be difficult to retrieve the Book of Death when Lunea mentioned Doom Kaos’s command.</p>
<p>Thump.</p>
<p>I stepped on the stairs below. Mount flinched and tensed up.</p>
<p>Thump.</p>
<p>I took another step down the stairs. Caso was a bit different. It seemed to be immersed in the chilly air like Mount, but there was a secret between us. It was cautiously looking at me with its huge eyes full of expectation. It was not expecting me to get promoted further, but it was probably asking me to stop the bastard from challenging its position.</p>
<p>However, it quickly lowered its head after a few seconds.</p>
<p>Flames spread on my wings and burned even more. Lightning flashed around me.</p>
<p>Thump.</p>
<p>Now it was the very last stair, where the bastard was floating annoyingly.</p>
<p>[We will have to see each other forever, so… I really want to get along well with you, Doom Man…. So… You know…. Right?]</p>
<p>The bastard’s ability to send shameless messages with a face trembling in fear was truly amazing.</p>
<p>I announced grimly, “I will carry out your execution.”</p>
<p>[Oh, shit. This is scary.]</p>
<p>“Try resisting if you can.”</p>
<p>[Do you think I’m crazy? Why would I do that? I, Lunea, submit to our master and the higher lords. So please, be gentle. I, Lu-ne-ah, am ready! ٩(๑˃ꇴ˂๑)و ]</p>
<p>Fine, you asshole. Let’s see how long you can last.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Lunea likely experienced a similar sensation to what I did when Entegasto attempted to grab me. It couldn’t react to the speed of my hand reaching out. Only its face peeked out between my fingers, and its entire body was caught by the pressure of my grip. If I concentrated my ultimate Power on it, then it would burst at any moment.ƒ𝐫𝒆e𝓌𝒆𝚋𝗻૦𝘷𝑒𝙡. 𝑐𝘰𝐦</p>
<p>However, the condition was that I couldn’t kill it. And even if Doom Kaos allowed me to do so, I had no intention of allowing it to die so easily. Entegasto must have had this mindset when it came down the stairs to punish me.</p>
<p>However, the result wasn’t what Entegasto had expected. Although I couldn’t defeat it, I proved my capability on equal terms. Also, I even gained the authority to teach this bastard a lesson.</p>
<p>Instead of concentrating the power in my grasp, I manipulated lightning bolts in a very complex and subtle manner. I made sure every bolt pierced through its entire body.</p>
<p>Zing-</p>
<p>[Ah, ah~♡ ]</p>
<p>As expected, its screams got on my nerves. The bastard and its kind concealed their weakness in this way and enjoyed the reaction of their opponent at the same time. It was how they resisted. Therefore, showing my rage would only serve to raise the bastard’s morale.</p>
<p>I suddenly recalled the past life I had lived before I traveled back in time. The majority of the Awakened were fucked up at that time, and I was one of them. Torturing other factions’ Awakened was common. In fact, I had been in a position to torture and had also been in a position to be tortured.</p>
<p>Torture… Although the perpetrator and the victim seemed clearly distinguished, it was an extension of the battle between those who wanted to suppress and those who resisted. Of course, the perpetrators were dominant in most of the battles.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there were occasions when the victims won. It was difficult, but it happened. In those cases, they screamed in agony and were soaked in blood, but they provoked the perpetrators during the brief gap between the sessions. If they lost the strength to provoke, then they would just collapse. However, the important thing was that they never told the perpetrators what they wanted to hear.</p>
<p>Eventually, the perpetrators were unable to control their anger and killed the victims. That moment was the victory that the victim had been waiting for. The victims died laughing at the perpetrators and their accomplices, taking the secrets with them that the perpetrators desperately wanted to hear.</p>
<p>The End.</p>
<p>Of course, now wasn’t the time to find out something from this bastard, but overall, it was no different. The bastard knew that I couldn’t kill it and that the moment this punishment ended would come. That was definitely the reason it was acting like that.</p>
<p>From the start, this bastard had been determined to defeat me.</p>
<p>[Please be gentle~ More gentle than this. Ahhh. It hurts~♡ ]</p>
<p>I had to suppress my anger to avoid accidentally killing the bastard. If I killed it, then the punishment I was inflicting on it would fall on me. I had to calm down in order to not be swept away by this bastard’s intentions.</p>
<p>I also needed to make the torment longer and more painful. This was supposed to be the mindset of the perpetrators long ago. I was lucky to be alive, but I had been in this bastard’s place before. Therefore, I knew what it was thinking about.</p>
<p>[A bit more gentle, please~ I might die like this~♡ ]</p>
<p>I ignored it and focused my Sense on my grasp. More precisely, I focused on how much the bastard reacted to each lightning bolt.</p>
<p>The bastard had no physical body; it was only a mental entity. However…</p>
<p>1. The bastard and its kind were composed of identical ‘forms,’ making it impossible to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>2. The pressure of my clenched fist was surpassing the physical realm.</p>
<p>3. The bastard was definitely experiencing pain due to the lightning bolts.</p>
<p>With these conditions in mind, I tried analyzing the internal structure of the bastard. I observed at what point it trembled more intensely and felt weaker.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was not a single plea for mercy or for me to stop. The bastard was stubborn.</p>
<p>The duration of the Man Who Overcomes Adversity was running out. If my intention had been to kill Lunea, then it wouldn’t have mattered whether the activation ended or not, but this was not the moment for the death penalty.</p>
<p>Permission had been granted to me to whip it until my anger subsided, but I didn’t want to end it with such an absurd punishment. The bastard had to suffer more and beg for death.</p>
<p>At that time, the streaks of lightning, which were as fine as blood vessels, were stirring the bastard’s internal structure. I chose the parts where Lunea experienced the most extreme pain and exerted power just enough to not kill it. And then, at one point, it finally happened.</p>
<p>[S…stop… stop…! Arghhhh…. P…please.]</p>
<p>Perfect.</p>
<p>This was the beginning of the real torture.</p>
<p>Lunea’s face had been trembling since it had been caught in my grip. However, it was not until then that it showed the reaction I wanted to see. It started to twitch, stretch out, and shiver uncontrollably.</p>
<p>[Argh! Stop… Please… S…stop!]</p>
<p>[I will… I will give it to you! The…the Death…the Book of the Death… Ugh… So…! Stop… St… Stop!!!! Ahhhhh!]</p>
<p>[The Book of Death!!!]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 425</p>
<p>Joshua suddenly realized that he was aging. The aging process had not been noticeable since he regained his former appearance. The feeling he had was purely due to his heightened Sense, while the actual speed of aging affecting him was incredibly slow.</p>
<p>He wondered how much longer his lifespan would be. Five thousand years? Ten thousand? Twenty thousand? The numbers that crossed his mind were so vast that it became meaningless to think about them.</p>
<p>However, it was different for his subordinates. The Awakened had been aging at a rate not much different from ordinary people since they returned from the Stage of Advent. Their lives were finite. There was a high possibility that they would die before reaching the age of one hundred.</p>
<p>Mmm…</p>
<p>Therefore, Joshua experienced a sense of sorrow upon witnessing his followers, with whom he had shared moments from Act Two, Stage One, distancing themselves from society. Although he was reborn in this land, his people were still confined to the lonely and distressing life they had on the stage.</p>
<p>At that time, a beautiful aristocratic woman approached Joshua while he sat on the throne. She was ghastly pale as if she was sick and had mysterious colors in her eyes that captivated people. She politely held the hem of her dress in both hands and bent her knees.</p>
<p>“Would you like to dance, my lord?”</p>
<p>A victory party was being held.</p>
<p>The party was bustling with attendees, but only Joshua and his followers were from the mainland. They had no interest in how the party was going.</p>
<p>The party was a typical Greenwood-style event, unlike those in the areas that the Awakened had occupied. No human tunes from the mainland could be heard, nor were any plates to be found. Instead, the melodious sounds of Greenwood’s musical instruments filled the air, while the attendees joyfully danced to the rhythm. Amidst the noble dancers, the woman of aristocratic status, who Joshua had previously rejected, was present.</p>
<p>Joshua got up from the throne and moved to where his followers were gathered.</p>
<p>“Are you guys bored?”</p>
<p>Ever since the Stage of Advent, his people had no attachment to the mainland. Unlike other Awakened who sought wealth and sought to claim territories, Joshua’s followers were not motivated by such desires. Their sole reason for being with him was their unwavering loyalty to him.</p>
<p>If they wanted land or wealth, then Joshua could have easily fulfilled their wishes. However, since they lacked such ambitions, he could only satisfy their primal instincts.</p>
<p>Joshua began gesturing with his eyes to indicate multiple locations within the hall for his followers. He first looked at the center of the hall, where the crowd was dancing, consisting of chosen vampire nobles and city dwellers, who had undergone the selection process.</p>
<p>Then, he glanced at the perimeter of the hall, where the captured knights and priests were bound and stripped of their clothing, regardless of gender. He then focused on the musicians, who were solely concentrating on their performance.</p>
<p>Lastly, Joshua shifted his gaze toward the men and women who were trembling in fear. These individuals were the ones Joshua had handpicked for his followers from the city, although it didn’t matter if his people wanted someone else other than this group of people.</p>
<p>“Go ahead and pick anyone you like.”</p>
<p>Joshua instructed his followers to choose anyone they desired from among the attendees. With a single clap, the musicians ceased playing. When Joshua returned to his throne and sat down, his subordinates started to walk around. A startled scream and a burst of tears could be heard from different parts of the hall.</p>
<p>Joshua then clapped his hands again, and the music resumed. Bitterness crossed his face when his last subordinate left. Over half of his people had died during the battle against Holy Knight Caldoran, and since capturing Caldoran’s city, more than half of the remaining had died in the ongoing fights.</p>
<p>There were fewer than fifty followers now, and the absence of his dead subordinates was painfully apparent to Joshua.</p>
<p>The party resumed as if nothing had happened, and an uninvited guest arrived. He wore a battle suit with two emblems. One was the logo of the World Awakened Association, and the other was the logo of a company or agency he worked for. It was evident from the iron tag around his neck that he was a mercenary and not an Awakened.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Joshua felt a strange sensation upon confronting the man, unrelated to his identity. Despite not being Awakened, the man’s gait displayed remarkable strength, and his pupils were dilated, akin to a cat’s at midnight. The blood vessels in his eyes were prominent, but there was no visible hemorrhage on his sclera.</p>
<p>He introduced himself to Joshua while standing beneath his throne.</p>
<p>“Thank you for allowing me to enter. I am Marco from TTMC[1]. I am currently stationed twenty kilometers north of Mr. Osiris’s occupied territory, and…”</p>
<p>The mercenary had adapted well to the laws of outer space. However, standing before Osiris and trespassing into the vampire region that everyone avoided caused unease to surface in his eyes.</p>
<p>Joshua asked about the source of the mercenary’s extraordinary abilities despite not being an Awakened.</p>
<p>“It’s Spider Web,” the man replied.</p>
<p>Unable to withstand Joshua’s penetrating stare, the mercenary quickly lowered his head. Then, he handed one pill to Joshua even though there was no order. The mercenary’s group had previously mentioned how expensive the drug was to him, but that did not matter at the moment.</p>
<p>Afterward, the mercenary divulged the true reason he had taken the risk to enter the building.</p>
<p>“There is a message from the Association's leadership to you, Mr. Osiris.”</p>
<p>「 Dear Osiris,</p>
<p>This is Lee Tae-Han. Thanks to your defense of the Land of Whirlpool, the Association could concentrate on seizing the central region. We would like to express gratitude towards you for your efforts through this letter. In addition, I am writing this to tell you an important matter about Mana…」</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Joshua’s eyes turned cold as he read the message.</p>
<p>Thanks to your defense?</p>
<p>He had no official responsibility, and even if there were, it wouldn’t have come from someone like Lee Tae-Han. The only one who could issue him a command was him.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Lee Tae-Han was implying that Joshua should remain in the Land of Whirlpool through the letter. Although it was just one sentence, Lee Tae-Han definitely knew how Joshua would interpret the phrase.</p>
<p>But the reason he is still saying such a thing is…</p>
<p>Joshua knew that Lee Tae-Han was trying to enforce his own ideas. As the letter stated, the safety of the battlefields where Awakened was deployed was guaranteed since Joshua and his people had confronted the invading forces and Holy Knights from all over the continent.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Joshua had defended the Land of Whirlpool by his own will as he wanted to contribute to his war.</p>
<p>He purposely refrained from requesting reinforcements even in the rapidly worsening situation where he lost his people day by day. It was only because he wanted to help him.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han…</p>
<p>Joshua thought to himself. Even without employing such obvious tactics, Lee Tae-Han would still get his authority over the central area. Joshua didn’t mind if he had to defend the Land of Whirlpool or expand into other regions for him, but this was…</p>
<p>You are in that position because of me, you arrogant fool.</p>
<p>Joshua crumpled the letter in his hand, and his handsome face remained contorted.</p>
<p>“My Lord… Is it because of the guest earlier? If you wish, I can go after him, then…perhaps teach him a lesson.”</p>
<p>The approaching noblewoman had noticed Joshua’s change in expression and offered him assistance.</p>
<p>Joshua was preoccupied with the situation that would happen from then. Whatever stupid Lee Tae-Han’s intention was, safeguarding the Land of Whirlpool and expanding into other regions was what he could do to support him. That was the only way the Awakened could quickly finish occupying the central area and advance to the outer regions.</p>
<p>The Greenwood Continent was immense, but it wasn’t the only continent of its size in outer space. There was still a long way to go, and that was why.</p>
<p>Being in a situation where he had no choice but to follow the arrogant idiot’s intentions made his rage surge up.</p>
<p>I can’t lose any more followers.</p>
<p>Therefore, the problem was finding a way to replenish the troops. There were limits to increasing the number of vampire nobles, and increasing their number did not only have advantages.</p>
<p>Moreover, turning townspeople into vampires also posed limits as a majority of them died from previous battles. The consequences of turning all the remaining townspeople into vampires were impossible because then, no one would be in charge of production as vampires couldn’t move during the day.</p>
<p>Joshua’s mind was consumed by dark thoughts.</p>
<p>Should I lift the restrictions?</p>
<p>He had prohibited hunting to prevent conflicts with other Awakened groups, but it happened often at night. It didn’t apply to him, but the circumstances were different for the nobles and ordinary people. Their thirst for blood was uncontrollable as they risked severe punishment by biting townspeople or hunting across the city. They usually targeted the lands vacant by the Awakened instead of the territories where the expeditionary forces and knights were gathered.</p>
<p>It was common for the Awakened to share the land they seized and leave for other battlefields. Therefore, it was an easy target for vampires.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>Making the territories of other Awakened groups into their hunting grounds wasn’t something to decide impulsively.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Joshua couldn’t make up his mind because satisfying the vampires’ thirst in the battles against Lacryma's Order and capturing as many slaves as possible was better than turning other groups’ lands into their hunting grounds.</p>
<p>His mind was gradually leaning toward this idea. It was not only because of the Awakened or Lee Tae-Han. He just wanted to hasten the end of the war that he was fighting. Thus, if he could eliminate powerful enemies in the Lacryma’s corps in advance and find ways to expand his territory… Then, he wouldn’t have to worry about his subordinates’ hunting grounds.</p>
<p>Finally, Joshua decided to go on a secret mission. He was not going to bring any subordinates. Instead, he chose some insignificant aristocratic individuals whose death would mean nothing. Men and women with pale faces gathered in his bedroom at his call, then…</p>
<p>“Joshua.”</p>
<p>A fierce wind rushed in. Of course, there was only one person who could call him that way. Joshua immediately knelt down.</p>
<p>“Welcome, Master.”</p>
<p>The vampire nobles also knelt following Joshua. At that moment, he saw an old book appearing in front of him. He lowered his head and slightly brushed aside his long blonde hair. Then, he could clearly see the book.</p>
<p>It appeared similar to the [Book of Death Volume 2], which had turned him into a Vampire Lord.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: Raise the dead, and make them your slaves.</p>
<p>Joshua heard his voice through telepathy.</p>
<p>1. Not a typo, was TTMC in the raws ☜</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 426</p>
<p>The mercenary was called Moose because of his large physique. It had been over three months since he entered outer space, and everything he had seen and heard in the land of Whirlpool went beyond what he could have imagined.</p>
<p>“Apparently, there was a hearing for the King of Hell on the 25th of last month.”</p>
<p>Despite being accustomed to surprising events, Moose was shocked by the news his subordinate delivered. It was as appalling as witnessing a vampire.</p>
<p>While assisting his subordinate in unloading supplies, Moose’s face contorted in disgust, as if he had just taken a bite of rotten food.</p>
<p>“I understand your concern, but Earth is fine. The King of Hell seemed to have dealt with it.”</p>
<p>“He kept his temper in check?” asked Moose.</p>
<p>“I checked multiple times because it was different from what I had heard.”</p>
<p>The subordinate calmly recounted the events leading up to the hearing. By the time his explanation ended, all the boxes of supplies and materials that had been loaded on the truck were on the ground. Moose sat on one of the boxes, unbuttoning his uniform shirt.</p>
<p>He unconsciously shifted his gaze toward the east where the city of vampires was. It was a dangerous area. To be precise, it was a region ruled by ‘Osiris,’ who was recognized as the Lord of Fear even among the Awakened, and spine-chilling rumors were always about the city. Some villagers even claimed to have seen walking corpses.</p>
<p>“I caught a vampire the day before yesterday.”</p>
<p>As Moose spoke, his subordinate, who had been away for a few days, frowned. His expression was similar to that of Moose’s when he heard the news of the hearing.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rumor was true. The testimonies of those who lost their wives or husbands to vampires were quite specific, and all of their eyewitness accounts were the same. There was no evidence, but the villagers were accepting the fact that vampires existed.</p>
<p>“Ah, I was wondering what that was. That must be the vampire you caught, then.”</p>
<p>The subordinate pointed at a skeleton that was hanging on the wall, and he continued speaking, “We might have to ask for more allowance, or they should at least supply us with some damn crosses or bullets. It is so creepy.”</p>
<p>“Crosses… You are joking, right? If so, that was the funniest thing I have ever heard recently. Just make sure your badge is properly attached to your uniform.”</p>
<p>Moose was convinced that the only reason why the vampires from Osiris’s city didn’t target his people was because of the badge with the emblem of the World Awakened Association. He believed the logo was the most powerful cross in outer space.</p>
<p>“Also, please take this. They said only one pill per person. Next time, we will have to buy it ourselves with our own money. You should have heard how rude they were, ugh.”</p>
<p>“What is this?” Moose asked.</p>
<p>The subordinate answered, “It is called Spider Web. I haven’t tried it myself yet, but I heard that it can make us like the Awakened.”</p>
<p>“...What the heck. Well, I am not even surprised anymore.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, good job. It will be a great help when dealing with vampires.”</p>
<p>Vampires… Moose couldn’t help but shake his head at the surreal word he had just mentioned. He had killed one last night and watched its body turn to bones under the sunlight, but it still felt like a movie.</p>
<p>Moose patted his subordinate on the shoulder, then got up.</p>
<p>Only five stationed mercenaries were in this remote village. The Awakened and mercenaries who had previously arrived together had departed for different battlefields, leaving behind only the necessary number of people to manage the village.</p>
<p>The subordinate was repairing a truck that had arrived on an unpaved road, while another was supervising the village soldiers at the podium. Another was overseeing the construction of a sewer system, and the last one was comparing the supply and inventory lists.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Moose had a pen in his mouth and was lost in thought.</p>
<p>We are still in the worst sanitary conditions. It is strange that there is no epidemic spreading between us. There is a limit to building sewer systems by just looking at books, but I can’t ask for more support. Hmm…</p>
<p>He glanced at the people bustling in front of him.</p>
<p>We need more soap, but it will be difficult to receive more supplies. I should build a system to produce it on our own. Yes, this guy would be perfect for the person in charge.𝐟𝘳ℯ𝚎𝘄𝒆𝑏𝗻𝑜ѵ𝚎l. c𝘰𝑚</p>
<p>Did we get antibiotics this time? Ah, I should confirm that, too. That guy…shouldn’t die. I hope he can hold on a bit longer.</p>
<p>I should promote Norman to the position of a commander. The guy in charge right now is likely to cause problems in the future.</p>
<p>Shit… if we had a mine, things would have turned out better. I don’t care even if it doesn’t have gold.</p>
<p>Vampires… But I shouldn’t even think about questioning Osiris. All we can do is strengthen the night guard. To do that, I need to improve their nutritional status first. There are so many things to fix.</p>
<p>From the group’s perspective, this was nothing more than a small, insignificant village. It was practically abandoned, and just maintaining the occupation was enough for Moose and his subordinates to fulfill their duties.</p>
<p>The purpose of this remote village was like the Korean Demilitarized Zone, separating Osiris’s occupied area from the other territories. Other remote regions bordering Osiris’s area would not be much different as they would also be terrified every night by attackers looking for blood. Support from affiliated groups would be minimal as well.</p>
<p>It would be awesome if we could establish a cooperative system with others in the same situation, but they all belong to different agencies… But it is still worth trying.</p>
<p>Moose originally planned to return to Earth after his one-year contract period. He wanted to pay off his mortgage and use the remaining money to buy a small bar and settle in a land where he would no longer see corpses.</p>
<p>However, his mind changed when he realized that the fate of hundreds of villagers depended on his decisions.</p>
<p>He had heard many stories. The incidents that took place in outer space were strictly kept confidential, and even if they were exposed, they wouldn’t be legally punished. Thus, the dominating group became the law in remote areas like this village!</p>
<p>Some villages were said to be thriving rapidly not only because of the civilization brought from Earth, but also because of the modern thinking and rational system of the ruling class.</p>
<p>On the other hand, some villages had deteriorated to the extent that their inhabitants dreaded the repercussions if the horrific incidents within their communities were exposed on Earth. They were certain that if their stories were revealed, the public opinion on the Awakened and mercenaries in outer space would turn hostile.</p>
<p>Moose had seen firsthand how his subordinates had changed since entering this remote village. Weeding out the treacherous ones, raping pretty girls, and whipping those who didn’t follow their orders were no longer tasks to hide.</p>
<p>However, the villagers often said their lives were better than before. That was why Moose wanted to do better. Although he was not a law-abiding judge, he wanted to become a judge who could improve the lives of the people here.</p>
<p>Also, he believed that would be quite easy. After all, the longer he stayed in outer space, the more his retirement fund would grow.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At night, Moose was waiting for his subordinate to return from the neighboring village. He not only armed himself with a loaded glock, but also took an M4.</p>
<p>Tap, rack, bang.</p>
<p>By recalling his training as a naval instructor from years ago, he reminded himself how to remove a used cartridge from the M4 rifle’s muzzle when it was obstructed. This preparation allowed him to be ready for even the most challenging combat situations.</p>
<p>In addition to the foreboding sense that his subordinate had not yet returned, he grew increasingly uneasy due to the village’s heightened alert for nocturnal vampire activity. The village became deathly silent, as though every resident had drifted off to sleep. Screams were heard only when vampires appeared.</p>
<p>The occasional sound of a horn had long since stopped. There was no response from the walkie-talkies connected to his subordinates.</p>
<p>Moose took Spider Web without hesitation. When he understood why it was called that way, he smelled blood. He also heard footsteps approaching him. He had to be on full alert, so he couldn’t afford to be impressed by the effect of the pill.</p>
<p>He hid behind a wall, aiming his gun at the entrance of the village. The feeling of his heart pounding against his chest was clearer than ever, and his mouth dried up quickly, probably because of the pill.</p>
<p>The door creaked open just after that, and Moose’s thoughts were quick.</p>
<p>This guy smells of fresh blood and it’s from the villagers and my subordinates!</p>
<p>Intruder! I will start shooting!</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Moose’s finger on the trigger did not move. It didn’t take long for him to realize that his finger wasn’t the only thing that had stopped moving. His pupils were dilated uncontrollably. All he could do was stare at the intruder standing in the darkness. He was being restrained by a supernatural phenomenon!</p>
<p>Moose remembered that the Awakened called this ability ‘Restraint.’ Convinced that the intruder was an Awakened, Moose gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this? If you think this won’t be discovered, then you have made a big mistake. The World Awakened Association will figure out what has happened here today.”</p>
<p>The person responded, “I don’t see a single Awakened around here. All I see are walking corpses that have recently died. They are all drawn by the power of Osiris.”</p>
<p>The intruder’s figure was still hidden in the darkness, even though the light was turned on. Then, long nails emerged from the darkness, and blood slowly dripped from the tips of the red nails. Moose couldn’t take his eyes off as if he was hypnotized.</p>
<p>However, it was not actually hypnosis, so Moose’s gaze moved again to chase the intruder. At that moment, a voice came out again from where the intruder was standing. It was a beautiful voice of a woman.</p>
<p>“Is it really Osiris? I find that doubtful,” she said.</p>
<p>“What the hell do you mean..?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Does Doom Man actually cherish Osiris? No, I should rephrase the question better. Do you think Odin cherishes Osiris?”</p>
<p>Moose thought about the answer without realizing it. Based on what he had heard, Osiris was Odin’s precious Awakened. The high-ranked Awakened, who had sided with Mary in the Final Stage, were now the board members of the association, Odin’s closest associates.</p>
<p>“You are saying the same thing as everyone else.”</p>
<p>“...?”</p>
<p>“But you also know nothing about Odin.”</p>
<p>Moose couldn’t understand the intruder’s intentions at all. The same went for her identity. One clear thing was that no one could casually mention Osiris and Odin like that. All Moose could see were the red nails flickering before his eyes.</p>
<p>He thought this was the worst-case scenario. If she was an Awakened, then there was room for conversation. However, if she was a species of Dragorin…</p>
<p>But how can she speak our language that fluently?</p>
<p>The beautiful voice coming from the darkness was definitely not from a translator.</p>
<p>“Don’t be scared. I will ask you two more questions. If I kill Osiris, will Odin really be sad?”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Mary is next in line. I came this far, so I can’t waste my time anymore.”</p>
<p>“W…what the hell are you talking about!”</p>
<p>“Last question.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Have you heard of Odin’s bloodline? I mean, the real blood relatives of Odin. The ones who have the same blood as him.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Okay, fine. You are mentioning Odin’s priests again.”</p>
<p>“Keuk.”</p>
<p>Of course, Moose was afraid of the imminent death, but there was one story he had heard consistently while staying in outer space. The mysterious intruder was bringing death upon herself. She seemed to have a purpose beyond casually mentioning Odin’s name - to challenge him.</p>
<p>Moose was confident that he would die today, but the intruder would follow him to the underworld tomorrow.</p>
<p>“I really do not like you human corps. You are all passionate about your leader, but you know nothing about who you are following. I will send Osiris after you to the underworld, so just wait.”</p>
<p>She sounded like she was reading a fairy tale with a happy ending. It was such a benevolent voice, but soon it came to press down on Moose’s breath.</p>
<p>Moose didn’t die of suffocation. As he teetered on the edge of consciousness, a memory suddenly resurfaced. It was the story of the Guide who had burst people’s heads during the Stage of Advent. He knew that could be his fate, leaving him with a jumble of emotions ranging from anger to bitterness, as he believed he had finally begun something worthwhile…!</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Moose died. When his body that had been lying down started to tremble again, he could no longer be called Moose.</p>
<p>“Ughhhh…”</p>
<p>“That is enough. You should be called a zombie now. Well, no. You are a ghoul now.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 427</p>
<p>Kasaila didn’t leave anyone alive in the village. She killed everyone, including the soldiers of the Demon King and the treacherous Greenwood natives. When they rose again as undead under the influence of Osiris, she killed them once more.</p>
<p>Once the darkness that enveloped her body finally vanished, her true form was revealed. The blood that had dyed her nails crimson seeped back into her body. Her ears were pointed, but she was different from the ordinary elves. With skin devoid of color like a vampire’s, her eyes bore a cruel, murderous gaze that contrasted sharply with the calm expression on her face.</p>
<p>She was now intending to move on.</p>
<p>“You. Are you Osiris? I was on my way to meet you.”</p>
<p>She muttered to herself, but her words were actually directed toward the hidden presence watching her from the distance. She didn’t need to turn around or raise her voice as it could hear her from afar.</p>
<p>[Please do not compare me to low-class beings like Osiris! I, Doom Lu-neah, am the sixth Demon King! (๑`ȏ´๑) I am on a different level from him.]</p>
<p>“Hmm… Well, Lunea. Your title seems more fitting for Osiris than you. Are you sure you are a Demon King? Why have I never seen or heard about you before?”</p>
<p>[You are so mean! My infamy is notorious in the world of spirits! But I will let it slide this time since you called my name correctly.]</p>
<p>“What if you don’t?”</p>
<p>[Why are you asking that? You already know what will happen. I have no choice but to show you why I am called ‘Doom,’ and the power of my almighty master. Then, you would get injured or lose stuff even if you are Ms. Black. Do you really want that? I don’t think so.]</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, Kasaila found that the entity sending the message was a small spirit. The tiny creature, who had just barely avoided destruction, was fluttering its wings.</p>
<p>“Did Doom Man send you? Why didn’t he come himself?” she asked.</p>
<p>[Doom Man… Ah. Don’t even mention that filthy and disgusting guy. Just hearing his name makes my teeth chatter with rage. I am sorry for the late greeting. I am Doom Lu-neah! You must be the Great Black.]</p>
<p>Kasaila responded, “You approached me, knowing who I am? You must be really brazen.”</p>
<p>[A lot has changed since the last time you were active.]</p>
<p>“But you weren’t even there then, were you?”</p>
<p>[Are you going to keep underestimating me? You will get hurt doing that. Hehe.]</p>
<p>Kasaila thought an annoying creature had appeared. She wanted to kill it right away, but it was prepared to escape at any moment. Moreover, she had a more important purpose than killing this fly-like being.</p>
<p>She asked, “So why did you come to find me?”</p>
<p>[There is a famous saying that the enemy of an enemy is a friend. I think we can be friends!]</p>
<p>“I have seen many cases where that was not true, Lunea.”</p>
<p>[Well, there is nothing I can do if that's what you believe. When you face death, you will probably regret this moment. Just wait here. I will call Doom Man as you wish. Oh, right! I will say my last farewell since we will never see each other again. Have a nice death!]</p>
<p>[‘What an idiot. She doesn’t even understand that I am trying to save her… She doesn’t know how strong Doom Man is, dumbass.’ Oopsy! I’m so sorry. I didn’t mean to say that out loud. I am still not used to this, so I made a mistake. Please forget about it!]</p>
<p>Kasaila laughed, but her narrowed eyes showed how annoyed she was.</p>
<p>She finally asked, “Is Doom Man that strong?”</p>
<p>[Don’t even mention it. He is incredibly powerful. You would barely be able to confront him after you bring out your true form, but you don’t like that, do you? Also, I only said you could barely manage to fight him, not defeat him. I am confident that Doom Man will kill you. You are going to die~~٩(๑^o^๑)۶ ]</p>
<p>Kasaila remarked, “It seems you know a lot even though you haven’t been here long.”</p>
<p>[Ugh, you are underestimating me again.]</p>
<p>“Are you sure Doom Man is not afraid of me?”</p>
<p>[What do you mean?]</p>
<p>“I wonder if he sent you in order to avoid me.”</p>
<p>[You tend to overestimate yourself just as you underestimate me. If you don’t fix that habit, you are really going to be in huge trouble. Tsk tsk. Let me make it clear. Doom Man doesn’t even know you exist. You are out of his radar. Well, you might get his attention if you kill Osiris. But that is only under the assumption that… You. Will. Kill. Osiris. For. Sure.]</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>[Listen. You would have to bring out your true form to kill Osiris. He has both volume one and two of the Book of Death. He usually keeps them hidden under the protection of a separate space.]</p>
<p>“But that doesn’t mean Osiris has become the Undead Emperor yet. You must not know what that is.”</p>
<p>[Hey, again! That is one of the basics! I know everything!]</p>
<p>“I think I have a chance to win without bringing out my true form, so why do you think differently?” Kasaila asked.</p>
<p>[Unfortunately, you know nothing about what Osiris has. If you attack him, then you will only expose your identity and be chased after. Then, you will encounter Doom Man. I, Lunea, will snitch on him.]</p>
<p>[Why do you not realize that every scenario will conclude with your death? Are you that stupid? If I have to deal with an idiot, then it’s not worth talking to you…]</p>
<p>“What does he have?”</p>
<p>[All of Doom Man’s priests have it, except for the two. Isn’t that funny? The one who actually created the item is your Old One. If you don’t believe me, Lu-neah, try it and see for yourself.]</p>
<p>“Why are you telling me all this?”</p>
<p>[Look. I haven’t fully recovered yet. Who do you think did this to me? He is receiving the favor of the Master, has become strong enough to confront Doom Entegasto, and is on the verge of reviving undead factions and bringing all of them under his command as soon as he takes the last volume of the Book of Death. Also, the human corps is freaking strong. Can’t you tell how cunning Doom Man would be right now?”</p>
<p>Kasaila murmured, “Doom Man confronted Doom Entegasto…”</p>
<p>[Against someone you guys are scared of and chickened out on… Ah, I should have reworded it better. You were having a strategic retreat, not running away.]</p>
<p>Kasaila frowned for the first time.</p>
<p>[Hey, why? What’s wrong? It has been a while. Let’s forget about it. Right now is more important. Hehe. Anyway, Doom Man did confront Doom Entegasto.]</p>
<p>Doom Lunea… This small Demon King was correct. While it was likely that not all the stories it told the Great Black were true, at least the ones from the old battlefield were true. The fear at that time was so intense that it permeated the entire soul, and the outcome was brutal.</p>
<p>Kasaila’s almost lost her temper and told Lunea to shut the fuck up. However, she felt the undeniable presence of her true self stirring vigorously inside her. Though dormant, it awakened in response to the weight of past humiliation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[ (๑´╹‸╹`๑)... Really… I am so scared that I can’t say a single word. If you can’t control yourself like that, then how can I trust you to work together? If you show such a precarious state again, then I will have no choice but to call Doom Man. Keep that in mind.]</p>
<p>“I apologize for underestimating you. It was dangerous. I almost killed you.”</p>
<p>Kasaila had barely managed to suppress the urge of her true form bursting out.</p>
<p>“So, tell me. What kind of work do you want to do with me?”</p>
<p>[You are the one who hid the last bloodline of the Great Red, right?]</p>
<p>Kasaila did not answer that question.</p>
<p>[Don’t pretend you don’t know. Doom Man is still looking for it. Fine. You don’t have to tell me anything, but you must hide it well so that Doom Man can never find it. Even I, Lunea, don’t want the Great Red to wake up right now.]</p>
<p>[Also, Doom Man won’t blink an eye even if you kill his loved ones. He is a very vicious man. If you think he would get scared and stop, then you are wrong. You perhaps don’t know anything at all… That is why you need the help of me, Doom Lu-neah!]</p>
<p>Kasaila said coldly, “You guys have such an extreme hostility towards each other. Thanks for the information. When the time comes to kill you, I will let you go without pain.”</p>
<p>[There is nothing to be happy about. There is no difference between us and you guys.]</p>
<p>“My thoughts are a bit different. Wouldn’t the things that remain become even more valuable if Doom Man, who holds precious possessions, were to lose them as well?”</p>
<p>[Sigh. What have you been hearing? It seems you haven’t grasped the true nature and how wicked he is. Do you think he will simply search for the treasure you have hidden? Absolutely not. He will discover not only the final volume of the Book of Death and the treasure you have concealed, but also the ancient relics from the War of New Devil. He will even demolish any magic towers he encounters. Right now, he is getting stronger every minute.]</p>
<p>[If that is the end, then I wouldn’t have come to see you. I told you, right? Doom Man’s human corps is as greedy as Doom Man himself. Don’t turn a blind eye to it as if it is just a matter of the Greenwood Continent. You may not know it, but you are starting a disaster.]</p>
<p>“This is getting boring. Why don’t you get to the point?” Kasaila asked.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, will make a plan! If you don’t believe me, then I will lure Doom Man to a place you choose. Any way is fine as long as you make sure you are well prepared.]</p>
<p>“Keep going.”</p>
<p>[Let me tell you again. You alone cannot confront Doom Man. At the very least, you need one more thing or person like you. If you want to be more certain, are you close to the Queen of Elsland?]</p>
<p>“Why are you asking that?”</p>
<p>[The Queen of Elsland is gathering your kin. It will be helpful. That queen is quite selfish, so it is hard to tell if she will listen or not, but that depends on you.]</p>
<p>[This is an incredible chance! You have the opportunity to turn the tide of the war in your favor this time. It would be foolish to let it slip away when it is right in front of you.]</p>
<p>“It seems like everyone wants me to get rid of their political enemy, and it is getting more uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>[Don’t take it that way. It’s good for you and me, Doom Lu-neah. There is no harm for either of us. I have more ambition than you think. Hehehe.]</p>
<p>“I am not talking about you. Doom Entegasto…”</p>
<p>Even though a long time had passed, Kasaila felt a shiver again as she heard the name of Doom Entegasto. She was shocked that Doom Entegasto had lost its power to be challenged by lower lords.</p>
<p>Considering Doom Man’s rapid ascent in power, it was highly unlikely that Doom Entegasto would remain passive and observe. After all, Doom Entegasto was capable of ripping the formidable Undead Emperor, his own powerful subordinate, apart.</p>
<p>Kasaila thought, ‘I don’t particularly like moving under Doom Entegasto’s plans, but it is not a terrible suggestion. Saint Jayden should not wake up yet.’</p>
<p>If she was cautious, being mindful of the possibility of a trap, then it seemed worthwhile to give it a try.</p>
<p>[It’s not a big deal if you misunderstand, but just letting you know that Doom Entegasto has nothing to do with this.]</p>
<p>“Fine, fine. But there is one thing I am worried about.”</p>
<p>[What is it?]</p>
<p>“I wonder if you can successfully evade the attention of the most powerful Demon King.”</p>
<p>[That is none of your business. I hope you focus on taking care of yourself… Look. What are your thoughts now?]</p>
<p>Suddenly, Kasaila realized why she had mistaken the tiny Demon King for Osiris. The scent of death emanating from the small Lunea wasn’t solely due to Osiris’s influence in the vicinity. From the very beginning, Lunea had exuded a smell of death, the overpowering odor of Doom Entegasto. Somehow, Doom Entegasto had managed to block the other Demon King’s attention toward Lunea.</p>
<p>“There is one final thing that concerns me.”</p>
<p>[Go on, tell me.]</p>
<p>“We will need more help. If you and your tribe provide us support when we launch an attack on Doom Man, then wouldn’t it be more advantageous? Especially if you genuinely desire Doom Man’s demise.”</p>
<p>[You only see one side of the situation and not the other. I, Lu-neah, am risking my life at this very moment. If I am caught by our master or Doom Man, then I will disappear forever. I will die! Also, there is one more important task to fulfill.]</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>[I can only tell you that it is the most crucial thing in killing Doom Man. It is not just you who sheds blood, so stop talking about help or whatever. Now, what? Will you work with me or nah?]</p>
<p>“You really are conscious of Doom Man. Alright. I accept your suggestion.”</p>
<p>Kasaila continued, “Ahem. I, the Great Black, Kasaila, accept your agreement, Doom Lunea. Until the death of Doom Man.”</p>
<p>[I, Doom Lu-neah, will also fulfill the agreement with the Great Black, Kasaila. Until the death of Doom Man.]</p>
<p>[From now on, we are on the same side. Just to let you know, I will send Doom Man your way if I notice any intention of betrayal from you. When that happens, you will desperately realize why I, Lu-neah, was warning you this much!]</p>
<p>“You are afraid of Doom Man, but good at scheming to kill him. Well, I don’t mind that.”</p>
<p>[We should get rid of him since I am scared. I, Lu-neah, won’t run away like someone.]</p>
<p>Kasaila answered with a stiffened face, “Tell… Entegasto that I will come and take Jayden’s heart again one day.”</p>
<p>[What the heck? Why are you mentioning Doom Entegasto out of nowhere? Half of the Great Red’s Heart is with Doom Man.]</p>
<p>[Has your determination to eliminate Doom Man grown stronger now? If you locate and retrieve the heart, returning it to the Great Red, you may earn forgiveness. Even without seeking revenge, accomplishing that alone would be a significant achievement. I genuinely hope for the arrival of that day.]</p>
<p>[So, in conclusion! What is the most important thing for that day to come? We have to be afraid of Doom Man. It would be a complete failure if we perish midway.]</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>[Doom Man is very very strong and scary 〻( `ω´)〻 ]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 428</p>
<p>“We need more local scriptures and priests who can analyze them. It is not that the scale is small now. To advance at the speed you want…”</p>
<p>The voice that had been following stopped as the scene of mutilated corpses unfolded before us. They had been torn apart and devoured. At first glance, they resembled as if they had been attacked by wild beasts.</p>
<p>Everyone, including me, thought it was definitely the trace of Declans. They were the only ones who could rip apart bodies deliberately and had the power to destroy bones into fragments.</p>
<p>The expedition team members scattered with torches in their hands. Rather than tracking the Declans’ traces, they were collecting the belongings that the corpses couldn’t take with them to the afterlife. The priests began to pay their respects to the deceased individuals, and knights started to prepare for a possible attack by the Declans.</p>
<p>“Remember. The profit distribution is five to five.”</p>
<p>The person who had been walking next to me was the exploration team leader named Ipo. Perhaps it was because he could handle Mana himself, but he didn’t hire an assistant. That didn’t matter as long as his skills were outstanding.</p>
<p>He added as he watched others collecting accessories from the corpses’ bags.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about your share. I will create a ledger to match the retrieved items so that you can compare them. Of course, only if you want to do so.”</p>
<p>The deads’ clothes were torn and soaked in blood, making it difficult to recognize their original appearance.</p>
<p>However, it was evident that these were not ordinary individuals, not only from their attire, but also from the scattered belongings. This was why Ipo had already mentioned the terms of the contract.</p>
<p>At that moment, one of the team members brought a flag and unfurled it in front of us. It was merely a blood-soaked piece of cloth without a flagpole, but I recognized the inscription on it. Enclosed within a large square frame was an emblem of the Barien Empire on the left side and an emblem that the former Emperor Barien had given to his successor.</p>
<p>The positioning of a silver star at the right upper part indicated that the deceased were members of the successor’s royal family. While it was an unexpected windfall for the exploration team, Ipo didn’t seem happy about it.</p>
<p>“Shit.”</p>
<p>His face contorted, filled with distress. The corpses looked as if they had perished less than a day ago, and there were only about two bodies of the knights who were supposed to protect the royal family members. There would have been many more people. I wondered what had driven them to this point, and what had caused them to flee to the area where Declan emerged.</p>
<p>The answer lay in Ipo’s stiffened face. He was shifting his gaze toward the direction in which the dead might have fled from.</p>
<p>The South.</p>
<p>“The Demon King’s corps must be close. I knew the Barien Empire was under attack, but I didn’t expect it to be this severe.”</p>
<p>Ipo looked at me with a questioning expression, wondering if I knew about this.</p>
<p>“Are you afraid of the Demon King’s corps?”</p>
<p>“We need to reconsider our expedition. Please hear me out. I know you are powerful and possess great wealth. But, bear in mind that the Demon King’s corps is dangerously close to us. No matter how strong you are, confronting them is out of the question. No matter how much money you have, persuasion won’t work.”</p>
<p>He gulped and then continued.</p>
<p>“Look. We haven’t secured enough resources. I guarantee that our exploration speed cannot be improved beyond this point. But let’s assume we continue with the expedition in this state. Let’s also say there is a significant relic hidden somewhere around here, as you suspect. Which option would be faster: us finding the relic or the Demon King’s army finding and attacking us before we can escape?”</p>
<p>I whispered, “Then what did you think I was?”</p>
<p>His eyes expanded to the extent that they appeared on the verge of bursting at any given moment.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One of Ipo’s hands instinctively headed towards his sword. His pupils trembled with all kinds of calculations in his mind. Soon, he removed his hand from the sword because he witnessed the space distort where I had shown my clenched fist. The distorted area stood out clearly against the backdrop of the night sky, appearing as a circular void.</p>
<p>As the brief moment of condensed pressure subsided, the surrounding space returned to its normal state, as if nothing had occurred. Ipo couldn’t take his eyes off from the once extraordinary void that now appeared normal.</p>
<p>I stated, “I will protect you from the Demon King’s corps. I will fulfill my promise of reward. The Declans will not be able to launch an attack against us. Just focus on the exploration for now.”</p>
<p>“...Can you…guarantee that?”</p>
<p>He was asking whether his life could be assured even after the completion of the expedition. If the team could uncover more relics like the battlefield where Doom Entegasto and Saint Jayden fought, then I could have guaranteed more than his life.</p>
<p>Anyway, the reason I disclosed my identity to Ipo was because I didn’t want him to be a disposable resource. Several conditions had aligned.</p>
<p>Even without Yeon-Hee’s help, I could easily turn him to my side due to his desire for revenge against the Atreus Empire. The story of him falling from a famous explorer to a sword-selling vagrant became a famous tale that reminded others not to be like him. The Greenwood species often talked shit about him behind his back.</p>
<p>“Do you know a guy named Onir?” I asked.</p>
<p>“If you mean the King of Mercenaries…who would not know…him?”</p>
<p>He lowered his voice, looking around cautiously.</p>
<p>“I heard his swordsmanship is as swift as lightning. His ability to absorb Mana is also fitting for his reputation.”</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to have realized why I was mentioning Onir.</p>
<p>“If you unearth more artifacts, then I can offer you that as well.”</p>
<p>The method behind this possibility was not crucial.</p>
<p>Ipo held his breath. He fell silent while observing the Lacryma priests casting spells on the corpses and his subordinates that he recruited wandering about. He might have thought my offer was a deceitful serpent’s manipulation. However, what I presented to him was an unparalleled opportunity.</p>
<p>I added, “I will give you time to think.”</p>
<p>He stuttered, “W…wait. Then… I will set up camp…here tonight.”</p>
<p>I shrugged. “Sure. You are still in charge, Ipo. Nothing has changed.”</p>
<p>After saying that, I watched Ipo walk away. He appeared extremely burdened, but no one paid him any special attention. The scene of deceased members of the royal family who met their demise while fleeing told a tale that weighed heavily on everyone, not just Ipo. The coffers filled with valuable gold and jewels meant nothing as they couldn’t be carried away after death.</p>
<p>The distant cries of wild beasts echoed the night. However, the Declans’ cries were absent as they had all fled from me. If I had the ten thousand-year-old spider, then there would have been the rumbling of spiders digging and prowling underground.</p>
<p>I had sent the spider to Jonathan through Yeon-Hee. Considering that multiple attacks from enemies were aimed at Jonathan, it would be more useful to him than to me. Therefore, the sounds of beasts were unusually loud.</p>
<p>Those noises then faded away. My thoughts suddenly got interrupted by the bastard’s messages.</p>
<p>[Hello, sir. This is Lunea. How have you been? I have been investigating Dragorin Red with all my means, but I have not found any traces yet. But please don’t worry. I am putting in a lot of effort, and I am confident that I will bring you nice news soon.]</p>
<p>[There is something important I must inform you about. Hehe. Doom Entegasto wouldn’t want Osiris to obtain the final volume of the Book of Death either. There might be a conflict between the factions loyal to Doom Entegasto and the Vampire Corps, so I thought I should give you a heads-up. I apologize for interrupting your precious time. Hehe. Please be aware that Lunea is always on Doom Man’s side. I will leave to allow you to rest then.]</p>
<p>[With respect and love ( ŏ ӟ ŏ)੭~♡ To Doom Man.]</p>
<p>I could not trust anything this asshole said. I could only accept a necessary extent and discard the rest. There were no magic towers or Declans nearby.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to regain my focus, I noted a drone in the distant night sky. A red light from the night vision lens was fixed upon us. The approaching drone meant that the other Awakened group would soon discover the expedition team.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Everything we find is empty. What is going on? Is there supposed to be a Declan in some cave here?”</p>
<p>“It is not that others took them. It appears the Declans have moved their residence for some reason.”</p>
<p>“So what is the fucking reason? How many have we found so far?”</p>
<p>“Nineteen F-class and four D-class mana stones. Five F-class drop items. It is barely enough to cover our daily expenses.”</p>
<p>“Keep chasing. Even if we encounter an army-scale group, the Caliber will be interested. If we negotiate well, we might be able to get away without a fight.”</p>
<p>“None of us are Korean, sir. If we approach recklessly…we will be screwed.”</p>
<p>“That is another problem. Should we start learning Korean now?”</p>
<p>“Mary has joined the war as well. To enter their inner circle, it would be better for you to learn Korean. If you do that, it will be easier to gain Caliber’s favor at least.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, Mary. I don’t even want to think about her.”</p>
<p>“I was under Osiris.”</p>
<p>“I heard Osiris rarely appears on the frontlines, right?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the same for Mary?”</p>
<p>“We were forced to face death. You and I…it is clear who had the worst times just by looking at the number of survivors. The bitch had to die in the Final Stage. If ‘he’ had not appeared… she could have disappeared forever. Fuck.”</p>
<p>“I am so sorry for bringing up a useless conversation. Ah, we found new traces… It’s a campsite. It seems like they had crossed over from the Atreus border area, but no emblem was found.”</p>
<p>“Then, they must be refugees or explorer groups. They have no guts. Zoom in… They are an explorer party, and…priests. I heard expedition teams bring priests with them.”</p>
<p>“What should we do? Should we attack them now?”</p>
<p>“Who knows if they have Saint Cassian’s archives.”</p>
<p>“They do have many soldiers, though.”</p>
<p>“Let’s try to make up for it in one go.”</p>
<p>“How many prisoners should we secure?”</p>
<p>“We have fewer than three days until the next entry. Can we afford the maintenance time?”</p>
<p>“Then, we will leave only one priest and one explorer party. We will swiftly deal with the rest and continue tracking the Declans.”</p>
<p>“Do you need me?”</p>
<p>“Nope, they are easy to handle, sir.”</p>
<p>“Proceed.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir!”</p>
<p>As the distant conversation ended, I noticed Ipo chatting among the night watch, probably because he couldn’t fall asleep. He was forcing himself to laugh at the boring stories. However, the more he did, the more the atmosphere surrounding him sank deeper into a swamp.</p>
<p>I called out to him, “They are coming. You better prepare except for the night watch.”</p>
<p>Ipo couldn’t detect the drone in the night sky or hear the sound of a group of Awakened rapidly approaching us. He looked around with serious eyes before hurriedly getting up. He asked before taking an action in a polite tone.</p>
<p>“Is it okay to reveal…your identity to the party members?”</p>
<p>“Yes, they should know who they are working for now.”</p>
<p>“Are you…thinking of killing the priests?”</p>
<p>“That is up to them. You can meddle if you want since there are more explorers. If you don’t want to clean up the mess, then you better hurry.”</p>
<p>Ipo moved the night watch back, and they did as they were told without questioning Ipo’s serious look. They quietly drew their swords.</p>
<p>The Awakened were indeed fast as their red eyes soon appeared in the bush. There were forty-six eyes of a butcher who had dealt with countless remnants. In other words, there were twenty-three of them. They had surrounded the camp from all directions, examining the structure of the site once again.</p>
<p>I heard Ipo’s voice from the back as if he had discovered one of the Awakened.</p>
<p>“...Please protect us, sir. We will do anything you order.”</p>
<p>Although he was a knight who could handle Mana, he was no different from a prey animal in front of predators about to hunt.</p>
<p>“P…please… Please protect us, sir.”</p>
<p>The night watchmen followed Ipo without question.</p>
<p>I lifted my hood back and turned my head. In that direction, the Awakened in the mid-platinum section was watching me attentively. The group consisted of Awakened without mercenaries. The one who met my eyes was the one who had the most authority.</p>
<p>I gestured to specify one guy. In response, it was not only him but all the Awakened also stood up from the bushes. They reacted in a way that showed that the situation was developing in an interesting manner.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, those who had seen my face at least once were petrified as soon as they saw me. Their faces turned ghastly pale as if they had stared at their own souls. They didn’t even blink.</p>
<p>Their leader was one of them. Those who had not recognized me started to grasp the situation. They first looked at the color of my hair, then my eyes. Their glances were contrasting my current look with Odin’s impression they had heard of. No voice had yet come out to tell them that I was Odin.</p>
<p>I pointed to the leader. The guy collapsed as he knelt down in front of me, but it was not due to my power. He lowered his head to the point that his forehead touched the ground.</p>
<p>“Oh… Oh….”</p>
<p>Then, the trembling voice that burst out right after was so loud that it woke everyone up.</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to see Odin!”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to see Odin!”</p>
<p>“It’s an honor to see Odin!”</p>
<p>The expedition members, knights and priests came out of their tents. The general workers who couldn’t get a tent allocation were just rubbing their eyes as they had woken up from sleeping bags outside.</p>
<p>The leader quickly realized my intentions as I nodded my head.</p>
<p>Ssssst-!</p>
<p>Three Awakened who received his gaze flew toward the priests, and the rest spread out all at once. Fear settled quickly. Of course, it was not something that could be seen with the eyes or carried as a tangible material.</p>
<p>However, it could cause shivers like a rash to those who had not been trained in such a situation, even to sword fighters who boasted of mastering the swordsmanship for half their lives. The members of the expedition team knew that I was the protagonist of this terrifying stage. They unintentionally looked at me and avoided my eyes when they met.</p>
<p>I commented, “Caliber seems to be nearby.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>I continued, “Tell him to come here.”</p>
<p>As soon as I gave them an order, one Awakened disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>I asked, “Is this area under your control?”</p>
<p>“F…five groups have intertwined interests here.”</p>
<p>“Tell the leaders of the groups to not even approach this area. I will pay the usage fee separately.”</p>
<p>“Ah…okay, sir.”</p>
<p>“Bring all the local documents. If you find any records of Saint Cassian, do not send them to the association, but include it in the file that would be handed to me. I will pay the price for each one.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“Bring everyone, including the priests and those who can decipher the documents. As long as they are cooperative, the number doesn’t matter. I will also pay you per person as well.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
<p>“The same goes for mana stones and artifacts. Bring them directly to me without going through the association. Each mana stone will be valued according to the costs guaranteed by the association, and the artifacts will be evaluated at the current market price of the exchange.”</p>
<p>The above instructions were sufficient. However, if I didn’t take the lead and set an example first, how long could this atmosphere be maintained?</p>
<p>If I broke the vibe first, then the powers would reassemble with a focus on the strong at one point, and they would chase after something more than money, eventually forgetting what they were afraid of in the first place.</p>
<p>“Add up the costs and include the rewards for your efforts. I will calculate everything here on the spot.”</p>
<p>Money was an excellent means of controlling them, even better so than fear.</p>
<p>“It will be a cumbersome task. Seek advice from your affiliated group.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 429</p>
<p>A stupefied looking guy joined us. It was understandable that he had gotten tired while climbing the mountain as he was neither an Awakened or a mercenary. However, the reason his face turned pale was because of the damaged corpses. His face was scrunched up and facing toward the corner, as if he was trying to calm himself down.</p>
<p>Seong-Il noticed the guy after following my gaze, and he said, “It must be his first time getting out of the safe zone. He is a novice named Park Ha-Jin. The company sent him. He is not a bad guy, though.”</p>
<p>The man he was referring to was Korean.</p>
<p>“I forgot to mention, but I am working with a company called Iljoo Construction. They do something else other than building constructions…”</p>
<p>I interrupted, “I heard from Mary.”</p>
<p>“I was planning to tell you when we met earlier, but I just remembered. It feels like we haven’t seen each other for a long time since we last met at the hotel. I should have come to see you first and asked how you were doing before you called me. I am so sorry. You know, I have been trying to make some money lately…”</p>
<p>Then, the guy started vomiting, but the Awakened didn’t even pay attention to him. The laborers carrying the stuff up were locals from the occupied areas, and those commanding them were mercenaries. Park Ha-Jin was the subject of ridicule from both groups.</p>
<p>However, his face seemed familiar somehow. I couldn’t stop looking at him. Was he one of my old classmates? He looked to be in his mid-thirties, so the age was roughly right.</p>
<p>“You are making quite a mess. Disgusting. I will kick you out.”</p>
<p>“Can you calculate without him?” I asked, pointing to the items that Seong-Il’s group had sent up. Some of them were from the detained priests.</p>
<p>“What calculation? Those are all Odin’s possessions anyway. What kind of bastards would get money from you for giving back yours? They must want to die.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il stopped talking and looked around, rolling up his sleeves. People around us began to look intimidated by his gaze.</p>
<p>I sighed. “Don’t get ahead of yourself. That’s what I told them.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il scratched his head. “Ah, okay. Then…okay, fine.”</p>
<p>Mana stones and artifacts were piling up, and the number of captured priests was also increasing. With just a bit of heightened Sense, the musty smell of old books wafted through the air.</p>
<p>There were very limited cases where civilians from the mainland, who were neither Awakened nor mercenaries, could enter outer space. Only members of the capital group, such as the academic survey team and Park Ha-Jin, could do so.</p>
<p>Thus, there were only five civilians who had entered the camp, and they were brought here by local chiefs. They definitely heard about who I was on the way up, so they were being extra careful. The local leaders lowered their heads to show respect and quickly left.</p>
<p>“I, Caliber Kwon Seong-Il, am honored to see you, Odin. I was in Revolucion 12 in the Final Stage. I will devote my life to you whenever you want me to.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il introduced himself in English, following the greeting of other local leaders. That was the exact format that others used earlier.</p>
<p>He then added with a smile, “Why are you looking so surprised? Although I can’t speak well, I have mastered listening to English. I have spent decades with them, and I am not an idiot. But… it is a top secret that I understand English.”</p>
<p>It took me a while to realize why Park Ha-Jin looked so familiar. He looked exactly like his grandfather. The President of Finance, Park Choong-Sik.</p>
<p>I asked with certainty, “Did he get in through the Jeonil Group?”</p>
<p>“That kid? Huh, why is he laughing now? Ah, yes. He pulled strings to get here. Not from Jamie’s side, but from an old guy’s group. It is not really related to me, so I am not that interested. Is he a special guy or something?”</p>
<p>“The old guy’s name must be Park Choong-Sik,” I commented.</p>
<p>Seong-Il rubbed his nose. “Umm…yes, I think so.”</p>
<p>“Have you met him?”</p>
<p>“What is the point of meeting an old guy who will die soon? I am busy looking at Ki-Cheol when I enter Korea. Have I told you about Ki-Cheol dating a girl these days? He has a girlfriend when he is still a baby.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean that Jeonil Group is sucking up Iljoo Construction?” I asked.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shrugged. “Company division and shit. It has been noisy. As far as I know, I am not part of Iljoo Construction but instead belong to a company called Iljoo MCA. I own fifty percent of the shares, Jeonil owns twenty-five percent, and Iljoo Construction owns the remaining twenty-five percent.”</p>
<p>I cocked my head. “That is not bad. Did you take care of it yourself?”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “Not really. They just told me that they tried their best to give me as much as they could. I honestly don’t care. Jeonil is yours anyway, and Iljoo Construction must be yours, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“So it wasn’t a big deal to me.”</p>
<p>I asked, “Was Jamie involved in the company division?”</p>
<p>“It has been difficult to see her recently. All I know is that the elderly have visited several times in a wheelchair. And then, out of nowhere, that kid got involved. Why are you asking me about this? Is he someone important?”</p>
<p>He was considered the heir of a family that brought me a great fortune. Park Choong-Sik was actually the one who grew the Jeonil Group to this extent, not Jamie. I had only met him once as a son of my father.</p>
<p>Park Choong-Sik devoted his last years to a master he had never seen before. Although he gained the power to hold Korea’s political and economic circles as a reward, his greatest fulfillment was not being excessive and crossing the line from there. Moreover, he was still working hard behind the scenes in the Korean business world, even though he was now over eighty and dealing with the turmoil due to protests.</p>
<p>“...Should I take special care of that kid?” Seong-Il finally asked.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, that is unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Park Choong-Sik’s grandson was already benefiting just by being here. Among Korean civilians, there were only a few who could enter this world.</p>
<p>I added, “He is nothing more than the grandson of my servant, the former President of Finance, Park Choong-Sik.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was inherent for individuals who have received an elite education in a wealthy environment to exhibit it. Especially in cases where they had achieved success through their own efforts, their true value tended to become apparent from the beginning.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether it was good or bad, each individual possessed their own strategy for the battle. They were adept at projecting an appealing image and skillful at winning the favor of others. This didn’t only apply to that particular guy. The civilian participants were holding business cards they exchanged with each other.</p>
<p>“They seem to get along well with their own circles. Adorable.”</p>
<p>They no longer paid attention to the confined priests, the segregated and closely monitored inhabitants of Greenwood, or the repulsive corpses. They were engaged in a serious conversation and concluded that not compensating me would be more beneficial for the future of each group.</p>
<p>Then now, it was time for them to choose who would deliver the message to me.</p>
<p>“<i>Let me speak on behalf of you guys. As soon as the opportunity arises..”</i></p>
<p><i>“I feel much less burdened. Thank you, Mr. Park.”</i></p>
<p>Park Ha-Jin. I knew that guy would step up. He came with Kwon Seong-Il. He shared the same nationality and language with me, Odin.</p>
<p>“You said he is not a special guy,” Seong-Il said.</p>
<p>“No, he is not.”</p>
<p>“But why?”</p>
<p>“He is Korean.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head at my nonchalant answer.</p>
<p>Iljoo Construction, which had undertaken the dungeon work at the very beginning, had grown to become one of the top ten construction companies. Now it had developed into the largest private military company in Korea and was working with Seong-il.</p>
<p>Park Choong-Sik, the Korean director who assumed an executive position at Jeonil Investment during the company’s initial formation, had now expanded his business endeavors to a broader domain with the assistance of his grandson, making inroads into the largest private military company in Korea.</p>
<p>The grandson, who had only been ten at the time, had grown up and now appeared before me. He reminded me of the old days of how I got here. Also, he reminded me of how much I missed my homeland, especially the country where my parents resided.</p>
<p>Korea… After this war was over, I would probably spend the rest of my life in that country. I would marry Yeon-Hee and take care of my parents.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><i>“We cannot receive a reward from Odin.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Odin’s decisions have never been reversed, bro. Be grateful and accept it when he offers it.”</i></p>
<p><i>“It’s quite a significant cost.”</i></p>
<p><i>“How much?”</i></p>
<p><i>“Excluding other materials, the majority consists of mana stones. The payment for our group alone exceeds a hundred million dollars, Mr. Caliber.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Bruh…your grandfather’s name is Park Choong-Sik, right?”</i></p>
<p><i>“Yes.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Is he the one called the President of Finance?”</i></p>
<p><i>“Yes.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Alright. If you want to make a good impression on Odin, then use your family’s wealth.”</i></p>
<p><i>“My family is different from what is commonly known. I will explain that part when we have time…”</i></p>
<p><i>“So I am telling you to prepare the calculation instead of being cocky, okay? Just remember who we are working for.”</i></p>
<p><i>“Can I directly talk to Odin? At the very least, I should convey our intentions to him.”</i></p>
<p><i>“What, am I just a scarecrow? This is your problem, bro. You are too ambitious. One day, you will end up in a grave. Just do as you are told, lower your gaze, and hold number two until you return to the safe zone. Got it?”</i></p>
<p>My meal was ready while Seong-Il and Park Ha-Jin were talking from a distance. I wasn’t talking about soup and bread. The boxes containing mana stones were neatly distinguished. They were supposed to be collected by the association and handed over to me, but since I settled here, it was appropriate to skip the intermediary stage.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, they were only a collection from nearby areas. I needed to visit the association for the grandest feast later.</p>
<p>Seong-Il returned, and we moved together to Ipo’s spot.</p>
<p>“You truly hold a high position,” Ipo said as he looked at me.</p>
<p>&lt;You truly hold a high position.&gt;</p>
<p>Seong-Il chuckled as Ipo’s words were translated into Korean in Seong-Il’s phone.</p>
<p>“Explain in detail to my subordinate what the exploration team entails, its composition, and the prioritized conditions for appointing an exploration team leader.”</p>
<p>“Forgive my impertinence, my lord, but may I ask about your purpose?” Ipo asked.</p>
<p>I responded, “I will deploy exploration teams throughout our territory.”</p>
<p>“Do you remember? I told you when you came to find me, sir. The Barien empire is not an attractive land for explorers. For generations, the Barien empire has been cooperative with explorers, so many of them have visited and have dug up their land already.”</p>
<p>Ipo continued, “However, it is different when it comes to the Atreus Empire, sir.”</p>
<p>Then, Seong-Il shook his head to the side, and the smile disappeared from his face. He silently clenched his fist and asked for permission by looking at me. As soon as I nodded…</p>
<p><i>Whack!</i></p>
<p>Blood splattered in front of me, and Ipo, who was thrown away, rolled around in the distance. He had to be thankful that Seong-Il didn’t use his full force.</p>
<p>Seong-Il snarled, “Motherfucker. I want to break your skull, but…I guess I can’t.”</p>
<p>He then continued, “Everyone is the same when it comes to trying to take advantage of chances. But why does that asshole want to attack the Atreus Empire? At a glance, they all look like the same kind from the central region.”</p>
<p>I explained, “It’s a boring story. The Atreus Empire took his treasures and family. Didn’t you say the next target is the Atreus Empire?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I did.”</p>
<p>I smiled. “Perfect. I hope you can speed up the process.”</p>
<p>“The association is already working so hard. It seems a bit excessive than usual. Is there something going on?”</p>
<p>“We should either conquer the entire Greenwood continent or succeed in expanding to another continent in one hundred days.”</p>
<p>“Is it Doom Kaos’s command?”</p>
<p>Seong-Il widened his eyes with such emotion.</p>
<p>“That is why Mary noona…”</p>
<p>“What about Mary?” I asked.</p>
<p>“She said she would stop by the headquarters then come here. There has been no news since, so she must be beating up the orcs. Those hideous faces must be getting cut off. She is hella scary when she gets serious.”</p>

<p>[LV: 641 (24.29%)]</p>
<p>After enjoying a satisfying meal, I noticed the sun beginning to rise. The campsite was slowly being tidied up, and members of the exploration team who had not joined my side were being relocated, while those who chose to follow me wore somber expressions.</p>
<p>The majority of those who resisted and were forcibly taken away were priests, known for their unwavering faith. Their fate depended on the occupying group, whether they would be traded as slaves or executed.</p>
<p>Seong-Il got up as he saw me, then approached me. It appeared that the side where he was had been settled as well. Since the translator application struggled to interpret the Dragorin language into Korean, Ipo was the one who explained everything to Seong-Il.</p>
<p>Seong-Il glanced at the mana stones rolling in the tent, then grinned.</p>
<p>“I cannot fully repay your kindness, but I will ensure you are well-fed. You must hasten everything upon your return. Take care of yourself. I will bring much more next time I visit you.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il climbed down the mountain accompanied by the President of Finance’s grandson. Leaders from other groups also said bye and started leaving. However, the extreme tension lingered.</p>
<p>Those affiliated with the Atreus Empire were concerned about their families and their future due to defecting. Some felt guilty for abandoning their faith, while others felt unease due to the newcomers joining the camp.</p>
<p>Consequently, everyone whispered nonstop whenever they had a chance, and it was the same when they extracted stones.</p>
<p>The sun was already up, casting its warm glow over the campsite. The laborers were diligently engaged in preparing breakfast. Their exhausted faces, appearing as though they had aged significantly in just one night, conveyed their wish to never experience such a night again.</p>
<p>Ipo said as he showed the list, “There are a total of 613 people.”</p>
<p>A number of new priests joined our group, along with many individuals skilled in deciphering ancient texts who possessed a vast knowledge of the region’s history, despite not being priests themselves.</p>
<p>Regrettably, they often faced harsh treatment from the Awakened groups. The governing methods of each group varied across occupied territories, but the mistreatment of priests remained consistent.</p>
<p>Their faces still bore bruises. They limped and were depressed, cautiously looking at their surroundings. Their disheveled appearance served as a stark lesson for the existing exploration teams.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it was not solely due to their state that no one tried to go against me. The exploration teams had seen my position here with their own eyes. They would have fled if they wanted to, but they would have never imagined fighting me.</p>
<p>The camp had 614 people, including me. Despite being the only ‘Demon King,’ that was the reason why no one even tried to challenge me, whether their defection was sincere or not. Having a huge change in the team would be unnecessary and bothersome in the future.</p>
<p>I said after calling Ipo over, “It would be better to build the headquarters here instead of moving again. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Thank you for asking. I had the same thought, sir.”</p>
<p>I added, “There are many injured people, and they are a burden right now. Tell the priests they are allowed to use their powers.”</p>
<p>Ipo’s face was swollen, causing one of his eyes to appear half-closed.</p>
<p>“The entire exploration team will deeply appreciate your benevolence, sir. And…”</p>
<p>“What is it?” I asked.</p>
<p>“It is about exploration. You mentioned the possibility of a significant ancient artifact hidden in this area…but I was wondering if you had acquired this information through a reliable source or if someone had shared it with you. Your answer would greatly assist us,” Ipo explained.</p>
<p>With the ancient documents and the personnel for their study secured, there was no need for further delays.</p>
<p>“Very well,” I responded.</p>
<p>There was a reason why the Barien Empire had maintained a cooperative relationship with the expedition team for generations. Ipo was taken aback for two reasons. Firstly, several large sheets of paper materialized in my empty hand. Secondly, they turned out to be a treasure map, considered the most exceptional among all the records of Saint Cassian. They were documents detailing the events of the War of New Devil, one of the items collected by the association.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>As always, there was no actual map drawn on the paper. However, the three pages were bound together in a sequential order. The pages described how they lured Entegasto to the grand altar that had not been discovered or stored in a secret place.</p>
<p>These three pages were recorded after that event. They demonstrated the events leading up to the encounter between Entegasto and Jayden in the grand temple from Cassian’s perspective. It was a remarkable coincidence.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Great Black and White were supposed to have confronted Entegasto alongside Jayden according to the record. Nonetheless, I had personally confirmed that only Jayden’s and Entegasto’s traces remained on the altar.</p>
<p>At that point, Ipo was flipping through the second page.</p>
<p>「Black gave an excuse.</p>
<p>“The Demon King of the Dead appeared with the skulls of Silver and Blue. I believed we needed to strategize our next move since our plan had been exposed, but the Great Red refused.”</p>
<p>However, who considers that as an excuse? Since when did Black and White act independently? At that moment, I felt frustrated that I couldn’t proceed directly to the grand altar.</p>
<p>After hearing Black’s excuse, I asked.</p>
<p>“Then, where is White?”</p>
<p>Then, Black answered with a face full of guilt, “White is dead.”」</p>
<p>The first page provided sufficient information to make an educated guess about the whereabouts of the grand altar. Consistently, the third page detailed the perplexing demise of the Great White, as narrated through Black’s excuses.</p>
<p>Ipo then turned to the third page. He indeed was talented at deciphering ancient texts.</p>
<p>“T… This…this is…”</p>
<p>He raised his head with an astonished gaze and locked his intense stare with mine. It seemed as though his thoughts were solely consumed by the revelations he had gleaned from the record.</p>
<p>Then, he hastily lowered his head, but his voice did not immediately find its way out. He fixed his gaze on the ground without blinking.</p>
<p>Saint Cassian, Jayden, the ancient dragons, and Holy Knights… Among them all, the account of two ancient dragons betraying Red out of fear of the Demon King was definitely a shocking truth to behold.</p>
<p>Despite the brevity of the three pages, there was another underlying implication. The fact that a hierarchy existed among the dragons was astonishing. Although this alone did not ascertain whether Jayden or Cassian held a higher position, it was evident that the remaining dragons were subordinates.</p>
<p>The Barien Empire had hidden such truth. Not just them, but the Old One’s Orders, other strong nations, and Holy Knight families must have ruled their people while concealing negative truths for generations.</p>
<p>But why did Cassian leave such records?</p>
<p>Ipo’s quiet voice broke into my thoughts.</p>
<p>“...There exists a formidable nation known as the Exile Empire.”</p>
<p>He continued to whisper, “It encompasses an imperial domain delineated by the Pateria Strait. Beyond that strait lies a land where numerous cities are united. Each city’s ruler is referred to as a Mayer, and Mayer Vivatus is one of them. Near his domain…”</p>
<p>I interrupted, “The Temple of the Primordial Deities.”</p>
<p>“Yes, sir. That is right.”</p>
<p>Ipo continued, being immersed in legendary stories, “That place may hold greater value than the Great White’s tomb. The legend of the Temple of the Primordial Deities is renowned even amongst us, sir.”</p>
<p>I recognized that his story would become lengthy, so I passed by him. That site had already been excavated, and Caso had told me this before.</p>
<p>However, it appeared that Ipo had become engrossed in the legend, momentarily forgetting the warning he had received from Seong-Il. Well…but it was understandable. It was the very aspiration he had harbored throughout his entire life. An explorer’s dream now laid vividly before his eyes.</p>
<p>He asked further, “Is this expedition…of personal interest to your emperor?”</p>
<p>My various titles such as ‘The Demon King Who Heralds the Night’ and ‘Fifth Demon King’ had now changed into ‘the Emperor.’</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>I returned to the tent as numerous areas of Mana still remained to be explored in order to unlock the ultimate restrictions on my Power.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ipo’s enthusiasm grew, undoubtedly believing that if the water had already been spilled, he would rather gain my trust and even capture the attention of the ‘Emperor.’ He had always possessed ambition. Once he had made up his mind, he acted as a true member of the Demon Corps.</p>
<p>From the very first day of resuming the expedition, he began to wield his whip. By the fifth day, he had even crafted a new frame for it. The whip was then replaced with a thicker one.</p>
<p><i>Snap!</i></p>
<p>As the skin was torn, the cries of the priests grew louder. The frequency and intensity of their beatings and whippings escalated, but they deserved it. Some had feigned reading the ancient documents, while others even attempted to escape.</p>
<p>What was certain was that the progress of the expedition had accelerated under Ipo’s unrelenting whipping. There was no doubt that the tomb of the Great White lay somewhere nearby. Ipo had even presented me with clear evidence, perhaps realizing that his own life could be at risk if he failed to produce results.</p>
<p>If it were Yeon-Hee, then she would have quickly discerned Ipo’s true intentions, but they were of little significance to me.</p>
<p><i>Snap! Snap! Snap!</i></p>
<p>The whipping didn’t sound like it would cease soon. As I rose to my feet, Ipo halted his whipping and spat on the ground. Not only him, but everyone in the camp reacted to my movement. It was at that moment that a presence, not the one in the camp, rushed into the camp. It could be Seong-Il or someone else who had equivalent power to him.</p>
<p>As I heightened my Sense, I confirmed that it was the big guy, Seong-Il.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: Problem! There is… a problem!</p>
<p>His voice carried an immense urgency. I struggled to recall a single instance when he had raised such a commotion over even something significant. Above all, he didn’t end with just a fuss. His voice was filled with a sobbing sound.</p>
<p>I threw myself toward the direction he was coming from, and my heart sank. I kept convincing myself that it couldn’t happen, but I shivered with an ominous hunch.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: It is not about Mary, is it?</p>
<p>- Seong-Il: I am so sorry…</p>
<p><i>What? What is it? </i></p>
<p>It was an answer that I never wanted to hear even in a dream. For a moment, my vision went pitch black, and I couldn’t even remember what I had said.</p>
<p>- Seon-Hu: What did you say? What the hell is going on with Yeon-Hee??&gt;!!!</p>
<p>I was shouting like that at the end. Then, Seong-Il came into my sight. The process of his figure becoming clear was as slow as the film development. Eventually, when his face came into my view, he was at a loss with surprised tears in his eyes.</p>
<p>He hugged me for a long time, and his voice sounded like a stretched video tape being played back.</p>
<p>“What should we do? Mary noona…she is…dying… I don’t know how she is doing right now…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 431</p>
<p>Every time I passed through the gate, there was a brief moment when my vision was obscured by darkness. It felt like I was being sucked into a deep swamp, as if a hand that was full of ominous, sticky darkness was pulling at my ankle. I could no longer feel my heartbeat. I just wanted to confirm whether Yeon-Hee was dead or alive.</p>
<p>When I arrived at Lee Tae-Han’s office, an Awakened was waiting for me.</p>
<p>“Where is noona? Mary noona!”</p>
<p>When Seong-Il lunged at him and shouted, I couldn’t take my eyes off the floor. Blood was scattered everywhere, and there were clear footprints that belonged to Yeon-Hee, marked with blood. There was a larger amount of pooled blood at the entrance of the door, where Yeon-Hee had collapsed.</p>
<p>Despite escaping using the returning stone, Yeon-Hee couldn’t hold on for long. The traces on the floor that her arm had swept indicated the pain she had dealt with at the time.</p>
<p>“I am asking you! Is Mary noona alive?!”</p>
<p>As Seong-Il’s howling echoed in the back, my eyes widened as if I had woken up from a dream. Yeon-Hee was still breathing not far away from here.</p>
<p>I didn’t remember how I managed to rush to the spot where I heard her shallow breath. My memory had been a blur ever since Seong-Il had told me the news.</p>
<p><strong>And now, Yeon-Hee was right in front of me.</strong></p>
<p>It was surreal to see someone like Yeon-Hee covered in vital sensors. She was lying in bed as if she was actually dead. Although she was unconscious, a contorted expression remained on her face. It was a painful look one might see in an elderly person struggling with illness before their breath stopped.</p>
<p>I couldn’t find the brightness she had the last time I saw her. I couldn’t believe this, and I was stupefied. It was weird how cunning a human could be. It only had been a few seconds that I had been praying for her just to stay alive…</p>
<p>My whole body trembled as I saw her face, and a disaster had swept away. She was alive, but she was not in a condition to say that. Her vital signs were weak. Her heart rate had dropped to a level where it wouldn’t be surprising if her life ended any moment.</p>
<p>[You have used Odin’s Wrath.]</p>
<p>I exerted my lightning power on her, just in case. However, her heart rate continued to decrease, and there was no sign of improvement.</p>
<p><i>What on earth had happened to Yeon-Hee to bring her to this state? My Yeon-Hee!</i></p>
<p>I unconsciously clenched my fists. Powerful skills were clamoring from deep within me, demanding to be unleashed. My body continued to shudder, and my voice trembled as I spoke.</p>
<p>“What happened…?”</p>
<p>As I asked and turned my head around, the scene inside the patient room came into my view. Not only were the association’s healers here, but there were also medical professionals. The blood that was smeared on their bodies was all Yeon-Hee’s.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han approached me with a grim look.</p>
<p>“Ever since her return, she has been unconscious. The message she left was…”</p>
<p>He didn’t seem to know what had happened either.</p>
<p>“Stop joking! How could she come back unconscious? I saw her clearly with my own eyes. She was definitely awake when she came back! Why are you not answering quickly? She must have left a message of some sort! We need to know what happened to her to treat her!”</p>
<p>An outraged shout burst out from Seong-Il. He angrily pushed Lee Tae-Han away and walked toward me. Then, he looked at Yeon-Hee, and tears welled up in his eyes again.</p>
<p>“Noona, what is going on? Please answer me! Please…please open your eyes.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il couldn’t bring himself to touch Yeon-Hee’s body and didn’t know what to do. He stepped back and checked on Yeon-Hee’s condition again.</p>
<p>The reason Lee Tae-Han and the association healers were showing concern was that there was no way to explain Yeon-Hee’s condition. Even without modern medical technology’s help, someone like LeeTae-Han could tell how someone’s life was fading away.</p>
<p>If Yeon-Hee had simply lost consciousness, then her vital signs and breathing should have returned to normal by now after external injuries had been treated. It was not due to the lingering negative effects of a death-related trait either. If her mind had been destroyed earlier, then she would have either died instantly on the scene or become a defenseless idiot.</p>
<p>However, she was in neither of those situations. I had a hunch about what had happened to her as something crossed my mind. My vision momentarily went dark as I remembered the trait ‘Revival’ that she had acquired a long time ago.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han met my gaze and opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“It must be…difficult, but please wait a little longer. An Awakened with a mental attribute is on their way.”</p>
<p>He said with a somber face, but it was meaningless. Although her skin was still warm and breathing, she was basically dead. I didn’t want to admit it, but it was true. The reason she could return here alive for a short time with a dead body was because of Revival. As soon as the trait’s duration ended, her breath would die down as well. Her body would grow cold, and I would never be able to hear her voice again.</p>
<p>That was how Yeon-Hee would truly face death and leave me. That was the undeniable, imminent future.</p>
<p>I had forgotten for too long what it was like to lose someone I loved. My hands were trembling in agony. I buried my face in them, and I felt uncontrollable strength in my fingertips. The pain throbbed wherever I touched with my fingers, over my forehead and temples, as if I was wringing them out.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, such pain didn’t alleviate my emotions. I couldn’t hear Seong-Il’s voice from behind me, even though he was saying something.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s body showed signs of being attacked by several orcs, but that couldn’t have been the direct cause of her death. She was more than capable of handling orcs.</p>
<p>It was definitely a situation where she was unavoidably exposed to their attacks. For instance, she was exposed to their assaults after her mental state was destroyed. The real event that sentenced Yeon-Hee to death happened before that.</p>
<p>A powerful mental being had attacked her. It was hard to imagine that any of the orcs could defeat her in a mental battle. She must have encountered a transcendent being. It could be the four Spirit Kings or one of the remaining ancient dragons.</p>
<p>Entegasto could be the candidate as it harbored malice towards me, but if it had been involved, then Yeon-Hee wouldn’t have had the chance to activate Revival and would have died instantly. Therefore, it was someone who was less powerful than Entegasto but with exceptional mental abilities.</p>
<p>Fucking Lunea.</p>
<p>From Old One’s faction, it would be someone inferior to Jayden (The Great Red). Blue and Silver were already dead with their skulls stuck on Entegasto’s knees. White had been killed mysteriously in ancient times, so if I limited it to what was left, there were no more than eight candidates for the transcendent being that attacked Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>1. Lunea</p>
<p>2. The Great Gold</p>
<p>3. The Great Black</p>
<p>4. The Great Green</p>
<p>5. Spirit King of Fire</p>
<p>6. Spirit King of Water</p>
<p>7. Spirit King of Earth</p>
<p>8. Spirit King of Wind</p>
<p>One of them was the one who killed Yeon-Hee, but I could narrow it down further. If I assumed there was a being as high in rank as Jayden among the three dragons, and eliminated the Spirit Kings whose physic abilities had not been confirmed:</p>
<p>1. Lunea</p>
<p>2. The Great ?</p>
<p>3. The Great ?</p>
<p>There were only three left, including the motherfucker Luena.</p>
<p>Revenge was meaningless. Even if I cut off all their heads, Yeon-Hee wouldn’t come back to life. Such revenge only had meaning after Yeon-Hee came back to life. After…after reviving her…then…so after that…</p>
<p>I consciously relaxed the tension in my fingertips. I brushed my face with my palm and looked at Yeon-Hee so that I could remember her in the future. If I let my guard down, then I felt like I would waste time hugging her, crying. Now was the time to think about the best way to save her, not the time to feel her last body temperature.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a presence suspected to be an Awakened was approaching the room.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Start now.”</p>
<p>I said to the guy even though I didn’t know the name.</p>
<p>1. Time Reversal Insignia</p>
<p>2. Revival Insignia[1]</p>
<p>3. Immortality Common Power</p>
<p>These were materials that could save the dead or those about to die. Time Reversal insignia lay dormant in my memory.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the problem was that an immense amount of Mana was required, not whether it could be replicated or not. The Immortality Common Power was also related to the Power that was locked for me at the moment.</p>
<p>The most viable option to try first was the insignia ‘Revival.’ I needed to escape to the mental world where time constraints didn’t apply, whether I figured out how to replicate it or collected the one from my father.</p>
<p>“Are you deaf? Did you not hear Odin’s words?”</p>
<p>However, the mental Awakened was daunted, rolling his eyes. He seemed to be trying to relax, but the fear in his eyes showed no sign of dissipating.</p>
<p>He undoubtedly believed that if he entered my mental world with me, he would lose his life. He appeared to be thinking that either his mind would be destroyed or I would kill him upon his fortunate return. Or he could be one of the many Awakened who wished for Yeon-Hee’s death. That was entirely possible.</p>
<p>He was looking at her with disgust. I was gathering all my patience, feeling as if the entire world I had built up was crumbling down.</p>
<p>“Do you want to die right now?”</p>
<p>“Start, now!”</p>
<p>Seong-Il and Lee Tae-Han moved almost simultaneously. The guy rolled in front of me, and I grabbed the top of his head with one hand to lift him up. With just a bit of a tighter grip, screams flowed from his mouth.</p>
<p>I let him go and said, “I will not say it twice. Begin.”</p>
<p>The role of a guide in the mental world was crucial. This guy was extremely nervous, but he was the only one who could arrive as soon as possible, so we had no choice.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, it was then.</p>
<p><strong>[This is Lu-neah, sir. There is good news and bad news.]</strong></p>
<p>With the first message, the brat’s voice poured out like a torrent.</p>
<p><strong>[The good news is that we have discovered the hideout of the Dragorin Red. And the bad news is…during the pursuit, I learned about an incident related to Doom Man’s female priestess. It seems that the Great Black has attacked her. Is this something you were already aware of?]</strong></p>
<p>I didn’t reply.</p>
<p><strong>[I am very worried about the safety of Doom Man’s female priestess. I sincerely hope she safely returns to your embrace.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[If you returned to the mainland because of that matter, then Lu-neah’s wish has been fulfilled. That is a relief. However, because she was attacked by the Great Black, she must be in a critical situation even if she is alive.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Please focus on treating the female priestess, Doom Man. I will somehow persuade the higher lords to carry out revenge and orders on your behalf. If you recognize my contribution, Lu-neah can do anything for you. Just trust Lu-neah.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[From this opportunity, I will prove my loyalty to you.]</strong></p>
<p>The message stopped, but it felt like the world before me was contaminated with a crimson hue. The breath escaping between my lips was scorching hot as well.</p>
<p>I pushed the mental Awakened aside. From that moment on, I relentlessly opened and closed gates in search of the asshole. With every peek, countless scenes flashed by.</p>
<p>Soon, I found the bastard in its homeland. It was lying helplessly in a cluster of light formed by its kind.</p>
<p>[<strong>W…wait… What brought you to this shabby place? I know it is hard to believe, but if you wait and trust me, Lu-neah will prove my loyalty…]</strong></p>
<p>I pulled my head back and opened another gate right above where the asshole was lying. I wrapped my hand with a lightning bolt.</p>
<p><i>Zaaaaap!</i></p>
<p>As soon as I reached my arm into the darkly torn gap, I grabbed the motherfucker.</p>
<p>1. Different from the trait mentioned earlier ?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 432</p>
<p>“Guide…”</p>
<p><i>What nonsense. That asshole is not the fucking guide. </i></p>
<p>One of the Awakened muttered as he saw the tiny bastard being dragged out. The voice slipped out while everyone was holding their breath. Lunea was limp in my grasp. I wanted to tear it to shreds immediately, but it wasn’t the right time yet.</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han and Seong-Il noticed my intention and left with everyone else. Now, only Yeon-Hee, the tiny asshole, and I were the only ones left in the room. I had learned how to inflict pain on Lunea during the meeting with other Dooms.</p>
<p>[Ugh… Aaaaaaah!]</p>
<p>The bastard repeatedly shivered, screamed in pain, and went limp.</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Lunea’s Light has been removed.]</p>
<p>As soon as I equipped it…</p>
<p>[You have used Lunea’s Light.]</p>
<p>The bright light scattered before my eyes. Although it was named after the motherfucker, it was the spoils of war I had obtained earlier that worked the best to remove debuffs or strengthen the mental system.</p>
<p>I then retracted the lightning bolts that were striking Lunea. It didn’t let out a scream, but its helpless movements were mixed with groans.</p>
<p>The asshole was not clueless, so it definitely had realized the reason I had strengthened my mental system even more. Its eyes, which were staring up at me, widened once more.</p>
<p>[You…you don’t have to find a way in the mental world.]</p>
<p>Its gaze shifted to Yeon-Hee, and the fear on its small face deepened.</p>
<p>[I… Lune-ah can treat Doom Man’s priestess with my ability…]</p>
<p><i>‘Treat Yeon-Hee? Is that what you are saying?!’</i></p>
<p>…This bastard was trying to deceive me until the end. I was confident that it didn’t have the ability to bring her back to life. Her mentality had been completely destroyed, and her brain function had stopped in terms of modern medical perspective as well. The trait Revival was simply sustaining her vital signs like pulse and respiration, but that would soon fade away.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee had already died even though no official declaration had been made yet.</p>
<p>I screamed inwardly, and it made me feel as if my entire skull quivered. The mounting fury threatened to erupt into a violent rage. Releasing even a fraction of mental restraint would cause me to burst the tiny creature in my hand. It felt like that would actually happen if I allowed my anger to spill over.</p>
<p>[Keup!]</p>
<p>Lightning bolts pierced Lunea’s body nonstop while I was attempting to suppress my anger. The pressure within my grasp must have intensified as well.</p>
<p>All Lunea could do was scream as it couldn’t even plead for its life. In such a precarious state, I needed to maintain my composure.</p>
<p>I said as I eased my grip, “Do not provoke me. I am barely…barely holding back.”</p>
<p>I continued, “I will enter the mental world, making my memories as the stage.”</p>
<p>However, the bastard had the same reaction as the previous Awakened with mental attributes as expected. Furthermore, it understood the perils it would encounter by entering into the mental realm of a transcendent like me.</p>
<p>[...]</p>
<p>I smiled grimly. “If you desire me to end your life, I will grant your wish.”</p>
<p>[I am…sorry, but do you intend to slay a lord without the judgment of Doom Kaos?]</p>
<p>It was not worth replying, and I had no more time to squander on this son of a bitch. I planned to eliminate this motherfucker and bring back the mental Awakened I had expelled. Even though entering the mental stage would be unstable without Lunea, this was the optimal choice for now!</p>
<p>It was agonizing that I could make this bastard receive the sufficient punishment for what it had done. I was supposed to see it begging to spare its life before giving the most painful death in the world…</p>
<p>I said while looking at it, “I will annihilate your entire clan after killing you. Now, get the fuck out of my face.”</p>
<p>[W…wait! Please!]</p>
<p>It immediately burst out its startled voice.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, was not mentally prepared… Fine… Fine… Where do you want the stage to be?]</p>
<p>“The moment when I got the Time Reversal insignia.”</p>
<p>[Okay, sir! Wait…what? What did you just say? Time…time reversal? What the… Is there such a thing? Oh, no. Never mind. Please ignore what I have just said. The stage is ‘the moment you obtained the Time Reversal insignia.’ Yes, sir. I, Lu-neah, will follow your command.]</p>
<p>The tiny creature’s eyes clearly showed that it didn’t want to follow my order. Though it was exhausted and powerless, the desperation it had at that moment seemed more intense than ever.</p>
<p>I closed my eyes and opened my mental world to allow the asshole to enter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Past memories were flashing by like a panorama, proceeding in reverse from the present. Some memories went by like a single photograph, while others flowed like short videos. This phenomenon occurred as the bastard began to rummage through my memories.</p>
<p>It was tracing back to the beginning, even further up to the time of my death fighting Doom Dejire in the Final Stage. Since the speed of the asshole searching through my memories was incredibly fast, the time it took to reach there was practically instantaneous.</p>
<p>Right then, the progression of memories being reversed came to a halt and started rewinding in alignment with the normal flow of time. This happened due to my deliberate intervention in its control. As I witnessed a frozen image of the moment when I returned to the mainland after completing the Stage of Advent, Lunea reached its breaking point and set a stage at that point.</p>
<p><i>Swoosh-!</i></p>
<p>“Attention, this is an actual emergency. All remaining citizens, please follow the instructions of the military and police for evacuation. This is an actual emergency. All remaining citizens…”</p>
<p>The sound emanated from the military vehicle equipped with a loudspeaker.</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s good to see you, military bastards.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il mumbled, gazing at me. The announcement stopped after repeating three times. Among the Awakened who had returned, there was someone who didn’t exist in that timeframe. A black-haired female student clad in a blood-soaked school uniform. It was the son of a bitch.</p>
<p>That fucking piece of shit used the appearance it had when we first met in the mental realm. However, it looked to be in a terrible condition, as if it had engaged in a life-and-death struggle. It was sitting on the ground, with blood continuously seeping from its skirt’s hem. When it raised its head to look at me, its face was as ruined as a ghoul’s.</p>
<p>“Would…you like…to change the…stage? If not, please open your mental world. So that… I… Lu-neah…can search through your memories… You must let me…in order to find the memory you ordered…then I can form the stage…”</p>
<p>The bastard was powerless even in the mental world. It had many scars from being cut and stabbed by sharp objects through its torn school uniform. Particularly, the stab wounds reminded me of the dagger used by Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>It became aware of my gaze and wrapped its arms around its body. However, there were too many scars to be hidden.</p>
<p>“I was going to tell you when we arrived at the stage you ordered. It is something that will be revealed anyway.”</p>
<p>Then, it suddenly lifted its head and squeezed out, “Entegasto ordered me to do it. As you know, Doom Man, I, Lune-ah, am a weak and pitiful monarch. How could I have defied Entegasto? I had no choice but to do as I was told. I really didn’t want to…”</p>
<p>Lunea even began to sob disgustingly. Tears dripped from its chin as it lowered its head.</p>
<p>I snarled, “Who said you could use the appearance of our human? You disgusting asshole.”</p>
<p>[Disgusting asshole Lu-neah. ゜゜(??≧⊿≦)? I changed it right away.]</p>
<p>It changed to its original, tiny form, which would be crushed if stepped on.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, will explain everything without leaving out any detail. So, please forgive me.]</p>
<p>“Shut the fuck up. I will check it with my own eyes.”</p>
<p>[Oh… You should not misunderstand it, okay? I, Lu-neah, was truly not sincere about it.]</p>
<p>When it had no choice but to enter my mental world, it would have expected this from the beginning. Therefore, it must have planned to blame everything on Entegasto.</p>
<p>[Please keep in mind that…the conversation I had with Entegasto took place only in front of him. You understand, right?]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, really had no choice but to follow his coercion.]</p>
<p>[Really. Truly.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Entegasto had used a certain ability to make the bastard invisible to Doom Kaos’s gaze. That was why this bitch was able to approach the Great Black and plan to go against me. Their interests had coincided.</p>
<p>Lunea’s plan was simple. First, it needed to prepare firepower with the Great Black and its group to face me. Second, it would lure me into an ambush and destroy the Life Vessel on the day of the attack. Before this, it needed to know where I hid the Life Vessel to carry out its plan, so it targeted Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that was a fatal mistake in its plan from the beginning. Yeon-Hee. It had underestimated her abilities, and the result was completely different from what it had expected. In a mental battle, it barely managed to defeat her.</p>
<p>After that, it couldn’t handle her alone in the real battle after the trait ‘Revival’ was activated in her. Therefore, it ended up throwing her into a den swarming with orcs. Moreover, it couldn't stop Yeon-Hee from escaping to her mainland. Then, the news about her was delivered to me.</p>
<p>This was the whole story of the incident.</p>
<p>[As you can see, I, Lu-neah, had hesitated at the last moment.]</p>
<p>[That could have been my mistake. If I hadn’t hesitated at the end to stop your priestess from fleeing to her mainland, then you would have been confronting the Great Black right now. However, I, Lu-neah, am filled with loyalty towards you…]</p>
<p>[See? That is how your priestess could return to your arms.]</p>
<p>I needed to tolerate it somehow as I had to deal with this motherfucker after reviving Yeon-Hee. If possible, by reversing time. Or, at the very least, by duplicating the Revival insignia.</p>
<p>[Would you like to check it again from the beginning…? If not, then…I will move the stage to ‘the moment you obtained the Time Reversal insignia.’]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, will do my best even though I am in a bad shape now~ ?(??0??)? ]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 433</p>
<p>[Time Reversal… It really does exist!]</p>
<p>The wooden table was filthy, covered in accumulated grime and waste. The purified water was only in a small cup, which barely looked like cups I had seen in my life. The bastard was slumped lifelessly on the table, then looked up at me, grasping the gloomy atmosphere of the rest stop. The curiosity glimmered in its eyes even in its weakened state.</p>
<p>[Then, I will start the stage…]</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>We had not actually traveled back in time. However, the mental world formed based on old memories and unconscious thoughts naturally recreated everything based on the pattern just before it took shape. If it looked in its original form, then characters would react as if the old Guide had appeared. Given that this area was under the jurisdiction of Revolucion, most characters would revere this bastard like a deity.</p>
<p>That was why I ordered it to take on a human from this time. It moved to a spot across from me and transformed into a black-haired girl, similar to what it had turned into before. Its outfit was designed to blend in, mimicking the gear of other Awakened.</p>
<p>[Then, I will start the stage.]</p>
<p>Time began to flow in the frozen world. The first sound I heard was a radio broadcast. Revolucion’s propaganda filled the air, highlighting the accomplishments of their elite attack squads and urging faith in the System. Their stories of valor were not about quests or battles with the Seven Demon Kings Corps but mostly about past battles with the Eighth Evil’s corps.</p>
<p>I rummaged through my belongings. As expected, I found the talisman I always carried with me in the past. It was frayed as only one page had been left intact, but it was a part of the bank account my father had opened for me.</p>
<p>However, that single page had been repeatedly soaked in blood and then dried such that it was difficult to recognize what it originally looked like. Even now, the talisman was stained in blood.</p>
<p>Yes. This was not long after the battle at the gate. It was when I had finally gathered enough points to open a challenger box.</p>
<p>The view outside the window was filled with beggars. As they couldn’t enter the exclusive space of the Awakened, all they could do was cling to the window. The windows were placed higher than a child’s height, so only the tops of the kids’ heads were visible.</p>
<p>However, there were only a few children, so most of them were adults. They were all dirty and extremely emaciated, so it was hard to tell their age. Also, the length of their hair was the only way to distinguish their gender.</p>
<p>I had referred to them as beggars earlier, but they were ordinary civilians. They were one of the few human groups that remained in the world, but their survival had been unfortunate for them.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, finally understand. Doom Man, you have walked the path of asceticism like a monk. Without you, humanity would have been annihilated. Only you could have accomplished such a feat.]</p>
<p>[You are indeed great. My loyalty has deepened.]</p>
<p>Then, I saw a man who had been watching us approach. He came from behind the counter and was the manager of the rest area. He was wearing the emblem of Revolucion like a medal on his chest.</p>
<p>“Don’t you need a healer, ma’am?”</p>
<p>He was asking the bastard, alternately looking at its injured face and armor. Of course, it was not for free, and there was a separate reason for his approach.</p>
<p>The asshole glanced at me and took out an identification card, the same one issued directly by the Revolucion at the time. Its card had a high ranking as the manager freaked out. There were six stars on the ID card. This meant that it had the right to cast six votes, and only those of a Named rank in the Revolucion enjoyed such privileges.</p>
<p>“I am so sorry for not recognizing you, ma’am. If you need anything, please feel free to call on me, Ms. Lou Lenah.”</p>
<p>It was then that I remembered why I had chosen this area as my last base. There were not many cities left as survival areas, but among the few options, Revolucion’s jurisdiction was special. The grotesque zombies clinging to the window outside were much better than other cities.</p>
<p>I realized that it was difficult to even find zombies in other areas. That was especially true for the First Evil’s area as it only had slaves who were responsible for the city’s filthy chores. Ordinary civilians were injected with an Awakened agent and used as military forces until they died. That was why I brought my mother here in the past.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation here in the past was similar to the current real world. In the past, I had wished for the annihilation of both the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues, and now I wished for the extermination of Doom Kaos’ and the Old One’s groups.</p>
<p>However, I had no intention to fight in the past compared to the present. The sense of loss was formed at an earlier time, and I had almost given up on confronting the Eight Evils and Eight Virtues. I was not capable of it.</p>
<p>Looking back, my life was just about running away by using Chaser and my S-class Sense. I had wasted a lot of time on various strategies, but I could never catch up with the Eight Evils’ and the Eight Virtues’ growth and speed.</p>
<p>Moreover, this was the end of the past era. The only remaining survival regions were the ones directly governed by the sixteen members of the Eight Evils and the Eight Virtues. The areas occupied by humans were tiny. Both Eight Evils and Eight Virtues’ groups were so far from each other that it was impossible to fight against each other.</p>
<p>Therefore, the future of humanity was doomed to extinction if their groups were destroyed. How would I have felt at the opportunity to travel back in time amidst such circumstances?</p>
<p>I was not swept away by excitement even when choosing the time to go back. My once-faded fighting spirit just filled heavily into me again, without any joy. Anyway, I didn’t want to face the world just before the time reversal ever again.</p>
<p>As the bastard lay on the table as if it was hard for it to stay still in a chair, I came back to my senses. I applied the abilities of the past to my current abilities. I had brought over the system of opening boxes corresponding to points. As soon as I evoked my Sixth Sense, a message from the old system appeared, not the bastard’s message.</p>
<p>[Would you like to open a challenger box?]</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>
<p>[You have opened a challenger box.]</p>
<p>At the moment the box lid fluttered to open, my eyes widened. Then, a brilliant burst of light poured in. The light, which could no longer excite me, reached straight for my chest. I felt an insignia become imprinted on my chest, but my nerves were focused on the sensation I felt when the lid opened.</p>
<p>[You have obtained the insignia ‘Time Reversal.’]</p>
<p>[Time Reversal (insignia)</p>
<p>Effect: You can go back to a specific time once. However, you must use it within one minute.</p>
<p>Class: S]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Insignia ‘Time Reversal’): 59 seconds]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Insignia ‘Time Reversal’): 58 seconds]</p>
<p>What was that feeling just now?</p>
<p>At the moment the box was about to open, not only were the areas responsible for Night Eye and Explorer response but also the Overlord zone. They all vigorously shook, and I felt something momentarily.</p>
<p>Finding a way to revive Yeon-Hee was the main goal, but the ‘truth’ was contained in what I just felt, which couldn’t be ignored. The unconsciousness indeed recorded the truth of that time about whether it was Doom Kaos or the Old One who gave me the chance to go back in time!</p>
<p>I told the bastard, “Reset the stage.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I had checked multiple times, but it was the same as what I had felt initially. I witnessed two Powers conflicting just before the box opened. One was similar to the energy that locked my Power, so it was the power of Doom Kaos. The other was, without a doubt, the power of the Old One.</p>
<p>I checked one last time.</p>
<p>[You have opened a challenger box.]</p>
<p>At the moment the box lid fluttered! The two energies clashed, then Doom Kaos’s Power was pushed away in an instant. Therefore, the only remaining energy was that of the Old One when the box opened.</p>
<p>So… it was the Old One… who gave me the opportunity to go back in time?</p>
<p>It was different from what I had speculated. There was a time when I believed the Old One had given me the chance, but when I realized how little the Old One thought of me and humanity and how great its attachment to Saint Dragorin was, I discarded that idea. Thus, I began to think it was Doom Kaos.</p>
<p>Time Reversal contained a grand and immense power. Even cosmic beings like the Old One and Doom Kaos had to be cautious when using such power.</p>
<p>But… The Old One tried to kill me like a dog during my battle against Doom Dejire. I couldn’t believe that it had used such vast power to kill a low-ranked monarch like Doom Dejire. That was stupid. Hence, I assumed Doom Kaos had made me grow quickly.</p>
<p>However, the truth laid before me pointed to the Old One. I couldn’t deny it. It was the Old One who had given me the opportunity to go back in time.</p>
<p>[...Doom Man? Sir? Should I reset the stage again?]</p>
<p>For now, I would think of the rest later as I had learned the truth, including the perfect timing to tear this bastard apart.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Entering the mental world allowed me to escape the constraints of time, so I could control my anger at the bastard and my confusion from the contradictory truth. Calming myself down was important to focus solely on myself, and I was finally prepared.</p>
<p>I raised my Sense in the overlord zone to its peak. As I looked inside, a sense of speed passed by me fast as always. If I focused more from here, then I would reach a state of Self-Obliteration, which would make me even forget about myself.</p>
<p>I needed to stop at this point to unravel the design tied to the insignia.</p>
<p>There was an outer shell determining its basic ability values. If I went into a deeper layer, then the areas contained within the shell unfolded. There were three areas responsible for traits, skills, and insignias. A newly realized area was added to these, which was the area where the Power was trapped. Thus, the shell’s interior was made up of four areas.</p>
<p>However, the shell looked different than usual. It seemed to be affected by the energy contained within, even though it was nothing more than an illusion. The shell was not cracked, but it appeared as if it would eventually be destroyed, unable to withstand the power inside.</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Insignia ‘Time Reversal’): 55 seconds]</p>
<p>[The information of the ‘Time Reversal’ has been updated.]</p>
<p>[Remaining time (Insignia ‘Time Reversal’): 100 years]</p>
<p>[* Please use the ‘Time Reversal’ insignia within 100 years.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 434</p>
<p>The restriction imposed on me, compelling the use of time Reversal within a minute, was a result of its immense power. Back then, my feeble shell could only endure such a duration. However, now, the information about the insignia had been changed, aligning it with my enhanced capabilities.</p>
<p>Back then, it was only one minute back then, but with my current abilities, it would last one hundred years.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>My first impression upon facing that majestic energy was that it would be difficult for me to deal with. As expected, my concentration soon shattered. I saw the bastard resting with its upper body on the table, and the world stopped.</p>
<p>The asshole hastily explained.</p>
<p>[Doom Man, sir… You used Time Reversal right after this… You will end up being in your mother’s womb, so I, Lu-neah, quickly stopped the stage.]</p>
<p>It was not wrong. Although the constraint on the insignia had increased to one hundred years, nothing else had changed. Back then, I had used the insignia with only five seconds remaining. Therefore, my records in this world would vanish after fifty-five seconds of getting the insignia. If time flowed naturally, then I would move into my mother’s womb. That was the moment when I had to inevitably suffer from pain in order to obtain the reward, the Man Who Overcomes Adversity.</p>
<p>However, there was still a way. This was the mental world, where infinite possibilities existed!</p>
<p>I ordered the bastard, “Continue replaying the stage, starting from the instant I obtained the insignia until fifty-five seconds have elapsed.”</p>
<p>I intended to stay in that time frame and continue my investigation, at least to the point where I could check the blueprint.</p>
<p>[You mean…nonstop?]</p>
<p>The bastard showed discomfort in its face.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, am grateful that you trust and rely on me. However, I haven’t fully recovered from my injuries as you know. I may need to repeat this countless times, but I don’t know how long I can do that.]</p>
<p>[I am telling you this to ensure I don’t interrupt your plan.]</p>
<p>“Do I have to consider your situation as well?” I asked sharply.</p>
<p>[It is not that… I, Lu-neah, have a brilliant idea. All we have to do is find a way to revive Doom Man’s priestess, right? So, instead of pushing yourself in this timeframe, why not move to the time when she obtained the Revival insignia?]</p>
<p>[Wouldn’t that be easier? *(๑•⌓•๑)* ]</p>
<p>I snapped, “Let’s move to the Demon Kings’ meeting.”</p>
<p>[Excuse me? Which meeting are you talking about…?]</p>
<p>I snidely said, “The most recent one. The time when you were desperately pleading for life.”</p>
<p>[Wait. Why do you choose the difficult path when there is an easy one…? Okay, I get it. I cannot dare to understand your intentions with my lowly thoughts. Yes, sir! I, Lu-neah, will do my best to continue replaying this stage.]</p>
<p>[So, please never say such terrible things again, okay? ^^;;]</p>
<p>I no longer felt anger boiling up as facing a grand and solemn power that I just encountered had greatly influenced me.</p>
<p>The bastard blinked its eyes as I didn’t show any reaction, then asked, tilting its head sideways.</p>
<p>[I am asking this just in case…but your misunderstanding with me has been resolved, right? You are not thinking of killing Lu-neah after all this, right? Hehehe…]</p>
<p>[Of course, you are not, but please don’t be upset and listen. Lu-neah is the one and only witness. In order to prove that Entegasto defied our master’s order and tried to kill Doom Man on his own…!]</p>
<p>[You absolutely need Lu-neah.]</p>
<p>The bastard continued to speak.</p>
<p>[Entegasto is not an idiot. Doom Man knows that, too. What happened to the priestess was out of our master’s sight.]</p>
<p>[Therefore, the conclusion is this. You can kill me, Lu-neah, but that will be the end! You won’t be able to pin the crime on the real criminal, Entegasto. What is the point of killing me, then?]</p>
<p>[Entegasto is the root of all this trouble, and…]</p>
<p>Then, the bastard straightened its upper body.</p>
<p>[Of course, the priestess’ life is important, but ultimately, what Doom Man desires is the stability of the mainland. For that, Doom Man will betray our master at any time.]</p>
<p>[But, I, Lu-neah!]</p>
<p>[Lu-neah has witnessed Doom Man’s entire life and the great path you took. Just as Aslan turned to Doom Man’s side, Lu-neah’s heart is no different.]</p>
<p>Then, it added after lowering its head toward me.</p>
<p>[Lu-neah’s loyalty is more sincere than ever. I, Lu-neah, would love to follow in your footsteps, Doom Man.]</p>
<p>[If Lu-neah follows the great achievements that Doom Man has accomplished, there will be a moment when Lu-neah can promote beyond the veil of darkness.]</p>
<p>[Lu-neah will remain unchanged until the day Doom Man reaches the highest step and defeats the Old One. Forever and ever.]</p>
<p>The bastard even shed disgusting tears.</p>
<p>[It may be difficult to forgive me, Lu-neah, but please do.]</p>
<p>[And please accept Lu-neah’s loyalty. It will benefit both me and you. I will help you to fulfill your goal by all means.]</p>
<p>[Look. Lu-neah knows that my natural character has caused many misunderstandings for Doom Man. However. However! Lune-ah’s loyalty is more sincere than ever. (*≧o≦)੭♡ ]</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>[If you cannot trust me, please give me a chance. At the monarch’s conference. I will expose every sin of Entegasto to Doom Kaos on the stand of judgment!]</p>
<p>[Without your intervention, Entegasto will never be able to escape from the predicament!]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Its words that it had been moved by my actions was not a story that deserved attention, so the bastard’s nonsense could be condensed into a single sentence.</p>
<p>“Please spare my life.”</p>
<p>That was the only genuine plea it expressed. It was aware of my intention that I would throw it into the abyss once I achieved my objective.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, will be honest with you since the topic has been brought up.]</p>
<p>[The fact that Lu-neah witnessed Doom Man’s entire life also makes forgiveness challenging. Therefore, if you find a way to revive the priestess, please erase Lu-neah’s memory promptly.]</p>
<p>[If only the memories of this moment remain, Lu-neah’s sincerity will remain unaffected.]</p>
<p>While I lacked mental attributes, the dynamics changed upon entering the mental realm. That was precisely what the bastard was alluding to. I could gain complete control over the mental world right now.</p>
<p>Additionally, the bastard had yet to recover from the injuries that had been inflicted by Yeon-Hee. Once I gained absolute dominance of the mental world, anything became possible against the bastard. I could transform it into anything or tear it apart. This was all because that bastard had come into my mental world.</p>
<p>However, erasing its memory was beyond that ability. It claimed it would pave the way for me to obtain control over that domain in the end. It undoubtedly desired to preserve its life desperately, even by suggesting that.</p>
<p>“You are going to confess Entegasto’s crimes on the judgment stand?” I asked.</p>
<p>[Yes, yes! The despicable Entegasto deserves the punishment of Doom Kaos.]</p>
<p>[Entegasto will not be sentenced to death because he is also an excellent resource for Doom Kaos. However, if Doom Man asks for it, perhaps you could receive Entegasto’s items as the price for his crime.]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, have one more thing to tell you. As you know, Lu-neah is not a gossiper but a cautious spirit. Don’t get me wrong!]</p>
<p>All the words that came out of the bastard’s mouth were not to be trusted at all. However, there was no need to stop it as it rambled on as if it was revealing top-secret information. That was how the mental world was. A world where infinite possibilities were allowed as much time as needed. If it were reality, then this bastard would have had its head blown off the moment it stuck out its tongue.</p>
<p>[The Book of Death, the final volume.]</p>
<p>“Why are you mentioning that all of a sudden?” I asked suspiciously.</p>
<p>[I am telling you again, but Entegasto is extremely despicable. He killed the old Undead Emperor that he created only because it was getting too powerful to be under Entegasto’s control. Also, he collected all the Books of Death. You must know up to this point. However, you don’t seem to be aware of the next part.]</p>
<p>[Entegasto gave two of the three volumes away. One to a corps commander from the War of New Devil, and another volume to one of the corps commanders from the battle outside of this star.]</p>
<p>[Oh, right. I forgot to tell you. The battle outside of the star… It refers to a series of wars like in the Stage of Advent.]</p>
<p>[Anyway, what is the funniest thing is that he kept the last volume himself to prevent something like the Undead Emperor from appearing again~]</p>
<p>“How did you find all those out?”</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, had two missions. One was to be a messenger, and the other was to monitor the movements of the spirit world and prevent spirits from interfering with Saint Dragorin. Many of my children are still on that front, watching others.]</p>
<p>[However, many spirits have survived since the old War of New Devil.]</p>
<p>[So, I obtained all this information from them. I can confidently say that we are better than human corps in this way!]</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>[Ah, I ended up talking so much again, but I can’t help with that. There was so much information, but most of what I received was garbage. It was not easy to distinguish what was useful and not.]</p>
<p>[Moreover, to combine all those pieces into one great piece of information…]</p>
<p>[Especially, piecing together all the fragments to obtain the top-secret information that Doom Entegasto still has the third volume of the Book of Death was hella difficult. I thought I would die.]</p>
<p>[However, I, Lu-neah, am happy to be able to offer this top secret to Doom Man. From now on, Lu-neah and my people will do anything for Doom Man…]</p>
<p>The bastard finally shut its mouth after checking my gaze. However, that lasted only a few seconds.</p>
<p>[You must ask for the third volume of the Book of Death as the price for Entegasto’s crimes. Doom Kaos will surely grant it. Also, resurrect a being like the old Undead Emperor.]</p>
<p>[Joshua von Karjan, Osiris…!]</p>
<p>The bastard blurted it out as if it was unable to contain itself.</p>
<p>[If you accept Lu-neah’s loyalty, you will be able to gain all of these.]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, will offer you everything. I will be your eyes and ears.]</p>
<p>I commanded, “Reset the stage.”</p>
<p>[Yes! Yes, Your Highness!]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 435</p>
<p>The composition of a single round was from the moment I acquired the Time Reversal insignia until fifty-five seconds had passed. It held no significance to count the number of rounds that had transpired, whether it was the tenth or hundredth round.</p>
<p>One certain thing was that the bastard became noticeably fatigued. Whenever the stage was reset, its eyelids were half-closed.</p>
<p>[Are we…still…not done yet? Your Highness…]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, am astounded by Your Highness’s unwavering determination. However, I, Lu-neah, am the problem. I am too feeble to keep up with Your Highness’s resolve.]</p>
<p>It was evident that the bastard’s strength was gradually waning. If the Time Reversal seemed to yield no promising results, then it would be fitting to proceed to the Revival insignia at this point.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that was not true. I had finally succeeded in finding the blueprint of the insignia when the bastard was whining. It was then that I figured out how to navigate through the majestic, yet serene, power. My determination solidified even further.</p>
<p>When would I ever have another opportunity like this? Even if I were to revive Yeon-Hee, I couldn’t burden her with this task. I had no choice but to repeat the short fifty-five-second stage millions of times without respite, which was akin to torture. It was something I could not and should not expect from Yeon-Hee.</p>
<p>Only the bastard deserved to endure such grueling labor. If it was to perish from exhaustion, then so be it. There was an Awakened with a mental attribute as an alternative.</p>
<p>However, my focus had to be solely on the Revival insignia by moving to a different stage. Thus, the best-case scenario was achieving my goal before this bastard died.</p>
<p>If I could master using the Time Reversal insignia… I would attain power beyond the revival of Yeon-Hee! I saw new possibilities, and that was another reason that prevented weariness from overtaking me.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One time, the bastard asked with an appearance on the verge of death about how I could remain unperturbed and continue my ‘research.’ When I didn’t respond, it hesitated to reset the stage. Now, even uttering a single word seemed burdensome to it.</p>
<p>Its face, which was no different from the beggars outside of the window, gazed at me. Its mouth looked like it was about to emit a putrid odor, but fortunately, it preferred to communicate through messages.</p>
<p>[If you obtain the power of reversing the time…]</p>
<p>The bastard no longer asked if I wanted to reset the stage as it realized I would never give up until I fulfilled my goal and would continue doing this nonstop.</p>
<p>[Your Highness… I would like to ask you for a favor. Please inform me in advance of how Entegasto will be despicable to me, Lu-neah.]</p>
<p>The bastard said as if I had already gained the mysterious power of reversing time.</p>
<p>[Then, I will pretend to give allegiance to Entegasto and betray it by telling everything to Doom Kaos at the critical moment. Then, Your Highness will revive the priestess and obtain the final volume of the Book of Death.]</p>
<p>[Also, I, Lu-neah, will be able to serve Your Highness wholeheartedly and no longer be in this feeble state.]</p>
<p>I stared at it silently, and I sensed no impatience from the bastard. It seemed convinced that I would accept its suggestion. It was peculiar how it could maintain such composure even in the face of the unpredictable nature of time reversal.</p>
<p>Its message continued.</p>
<p>[If Your Highness goes to my, Lu-neah’s, mainland…]</p>
<p>However, the message that was supposed to follow did not appear. Its eyes were quivering, and it had been quite a while since I last witnessed a flicker of uncertainty in the eyes of the bastard. Such a reckless spirit was cautiously debating whether or not to say more. There was crucial information inside its throat that needed careful consideration before being spoken.</p>
<p>I did not urge it to reset the stage, and the trembling in the bastard’s eyes began to subside. This reminded me of a long time ago when it babbled about the reasons to save its life while mentioning the last volume of the Book of Death.</p>
<p>Its words led to a new topic.</p>
<p>[Please give a hint to me, Lu-neah, if you go back in time. I am really, really telling the truth now. The past loyalty of Lu-neah was not as great as it is now. It is not that there was no loyalty at the time. I am just saying that I have never been so loyal before.]</p>
<p>[Anyway.]</p>
<p>[The same thing keeps happening. What Lu-neah and Entegasto will do in the future… Only Doom Man knows what will happen.]</p>
<p>[You will appear in time, when the little Lu-neah inevitably attacked the priestess, right?]</p>
<p>“It depends on what you do.”</p>
<p>[No way~ Lu-neah is not done speaking, so please listen carefully until the end. I am going to say something very, very important. You will be intrigued.]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, joined later than Doom Man’s human corps. However, I was able to obtain various special information more quickly, including the last volume of the Book of Death.]</p>
<p>[Please listen more. In order to obtain such a secret, finding the records of the Great Gold is one way. However, that will take too much time.]</p>
<p>The bastard continued after checking my face.</p>
<p>[Why? You also suspected that Cassian would be the Great Gold, didn’t you?]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, can proudly say that when it comes to collecting special information, I am above the human corps. Your Highness should still command the human corps but should operate another channel to obtain information.]</p>
<p>[Please wait a minute. I am not done yet. This is the last and very important thing.]</p>
<p>[There is a ‘memory warehouse’ in Lu-neah’s mainland. Highly advanced species like Lu-neah can share memories and emotions with each other. Your Highness would know about it well because your faithful subordinate Orca does the same thing.]</p>
<p>[However, the difference between Orca and Lu-neah is that I am a more superior being.]</p>
<p>[Lu-neah’s clan stores memories and feelings separately for the next successors.]</p>
<p>[That is right. Your Highness must have noticed. I will explain where to hide and retake them. In summary, it is like this.]</p>
<p>[First, go back in time.]</p>
<p>[Second, enter Lu-neah’s memory warehouse.]</p>
<p>[Third, give a hint about what is happening to Lu-neah who will be surprised.]</p>
<p>[Fourth, reveal all the crimes of Entegasto to Doom Kaos with Lu-neah.]</p>
<p>[Fifth, take the last volume of the Book of Death.]</p>
<p>[Sixth, command Lu-neah as much as you want.]</p>
<p>[Seventh, Doom Man’s priestess will have a happy ending without any harm~ ٩(๑^o^๑)۶ ]</p>
<p>The bastard lay down on the table, smiling slyly.</p>
<p>I said, “You insects talk too much… I will do that.”</p>
<p>[Thank you, Your Highness.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>We had gone through many rounds, and the bastard’s life had deteriorated to the brink of death. It had the appearance of a young female student, but its face had turned ghastly pale, and it no longer sent any messages.</p>
<p>It was lying on the table, looking at me. Its desperate gaze, as if it was about to die, felt like it was cheering me on. It wanted me to gain the power of reversing time more than anything else because it was convinced that it was the only way for it to survive. Of course, it was only possible if I gained the power before its life was extinguished.</p>
<p>It was silent as it was saving its energy to speak later. It had put all its efforts into resetting the stage to the point of near-death.</p>
<p>“It is over.”</p>
<p>It had been a long time since I opened my mouth, then the corners of the bastard’s lips twitched. It smiled faintly, but it didn’t last long. It frowned again as if it didn’t even have the strength to be in pain.</p>
<p>Swoosh-!</p>
<p>The first thing that came into view was the bastard. It passed by my sight and collapsed immediately. Despite the absence of a physical body, the bastard stopped as if it had hit the ground.</p>
<p>The time spent in the mental world was like hell for the bastard. Thus, having achieved something and returned, it rolled over as if wanting to witness the final moment with its own eyes.</p>
<p>It looked at me as if it was saying, ‘We did it.’</p>
<p>In the corner of my vision, Yeon-Hee was lying down just like long ago. She was lying on a bed, and her body was covered in monitoring sensors that reminded me of a Maruka’s tentacles. An urge to tear them off right away welled up inside me. That was right after returning to reality.</p>
<p>I moved to a larger area.</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[Odin’s Absolute Warzone has opened.]</p>
<p>I formed a barrier first, being alert of things like Entegasto. Next, I started taking out items. If I reversed the time, what happened here would vanish as if it had never occurred. I would get these back anyway. I had no hesitation in destroying whatever equipment was on my body.</p>
<p>[Extractor has been activated.]</p>
<p>[Lunea’s Light has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Zeus’s Thunder Spear has been destroyed.]</p>
<p>[You have gained XP.]</p>
<p>Then, I peeled away the components that made me up one by one and threw them into the insignia.</p>
<p>[The Man Who Overcomes Adversity has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Passion has been removed.]</p>
<p>…</p>
<p>[Odin’s Ethereal Animal has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Odin’s Wrath has been removed.]</p>
<p>[Devi’s Sword has been removed.]</p>
<p>I pulled out everything from the shell that determined my four main abilities except for Strength.</p>
<p>[Warning: Odin’s Absolute Warzone is on the verge of destruction.]</p>
<p>Everything was swirling around. It was not the time to appreciate how vast and powerful the Mana Blade I had created was.</p>
<p>I endured with the Strength of the Overlord section. Since I could be swept away by the force that was stirring the barrier, I tensed up all the muscles in my body to withstand it.</p>
<p>When I entered the self-obliteration state, there was no barrier left anywhere. Instead, the message I had been waiting for appeared before my eyes.</p>
<p>[You have obtained the insignia ‘Time Reversal.’]</p>
<p>[Time Reversal (Insignia)</p>
<p>Effect: You can go back once in time within a twenty-four-hour period.</p>
<p>Class: SSS]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 436</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p>[You have used the insignia ‘Time Reversal.’]</p>
<p>[Would you like to travel back in time?]</p>
<p>[Please select a date.]</p>
<p>I stated, “One day ago from now.”</p>
<p>I felt as if all my surroundings were being sucked into a single spot. Then, pop! A flash of light burst before my eyes.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I was inside a tent, and I could hear unfamiliar voices in the Dragorin language. I tried to remember and realized where I was. It was the campsite of the expedition team chasing the Great White’s tomb. At this point in time, I was there.</p>
<p>[Name: Incarnation Na Seon-Hu</p>
<p>Level: 641 (Overlord) Second Round]</p>
<p>All my abilities and items were back as they were at this point in time, but one area was different. The figure for Power! I had repeatedly opened and closed the gates to find the old bastard. Even though I had traveled back in time, it remained unchanged.</p>
<p>It was a new fact. Power existed in an area that was not affected by the time reversal.</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>I didn’t know if it was something that only applied to me, who caused the time reversal, or whether it was something applied to all transcendent beings with Power. However, all I knew was that it was important because Doom Entegasto could notice that time had been reversed.</p>
<p>So far, it seemed likely that it only applied to me. This wasn’t the first time that the time had been reversed. After all, It had happened before when I received the insignia from the Old One in the past.</p>
<p>Excluding Doom Kaos and the Old One, I would have encountered the ‘event of time reversal’ before I obtained the insignia if other transcendent beings could have noticed it. They would have tried finding an individual, who traveled back in time, or shown an awareness of me.</p>
<p>However, they had never done so. The insignia I used now was nothing more than a copy made from the blueprint, not modified to suit my taste. If I had mastered it to the level where I could mimic and create something new, then I would have known beforehand that there were restrictions on Power.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would have been impossible for the Old One to remove such restrictions. In conclusion, the most credible hypothesis was… that the Power of the being who led the time travel was not affected by the time reversal. That was it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The copied Time Reversal insignia had one more restriction aside from the Power figure. The timeframe that could be reversed was limited to one day.</p>
<p>However, with my current ability, I could copy and paste another insignia and travel back in one more day. I could repeat this endlessly.</p>
<p>If I repeated this process, I could go back to the very beginning, where I could create the insignia nonstop. That was up to the timeframe where my Sense reached the Ender section.</p>
<p>The reason why I couldn’t go back beyond that was simple. The minimum condition for manipulating the internal area was having the Sense of the Ender section.</p>
<p>However, by the time I got to that period, the total amount of Mana I could draw out would be drastically lower than now. The restriction of the time of one day would narrow down to a few hours. There would be no occasion where I could go all the way back to the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>The present was the standard. If a crisis hit me or my surroundings from now on, then I would turn back in time. The remaining question was to what extent the Old One and Doom Kaos could intervene in this.</p>
<p>I ended my analysis there. Yeon-Hee was on the continent of the orcs at the moment. Around this time tomorrow, Seong-Il would come running to me to deliver the news of her death. In roughly 12 hours, Yeon-Hee would be attacked by the bastard. Currently, the bastard was waiting for that time while fulfilling Doom Kaos’s orders in the spirit realm.</p>
<p>It, of course, didn’t know what I was doing. All those messages the bastard sent now were for the effect of delivering Doom Kaos’s words. If I went to Yeon-Hee like this, then neither the bastard nor Entegasto would show any reaction.</p>
<p>The bastard’s plan was thus:</p>
<p>[First, go back in time.]</p>
<p>[Second, enter Lu-neah’s memory warehouse.]</p>
<p>[Third, give a hint about what is happening to Lu-neah who will be surprised.]</p>
<p>[Fourth, reveal all the crimes of Entegasto to Doom Kaos with Lu-neah.]</p>
<p>[Fifth, take the last volume of the Book of Death.]</p>
<p>[Sixth, command Lu-neah as much as you want.]</p>
<p>[Seventh, Doom Man’s priestess will have a happy ending without any harm~ ٩(๑^o^๑)۶ ]</p>
<p>But that was my last resort. For now, I stood still without opening a gate to Yeon-Hee. Doom Kaos and the Old One might have known that time had been reversed by a day. Therefore, I was waiting for Doom Kaos’s call, but it was quiet.</p>
<p>It was honestly painful to wait in such silence. My mind kept wavering. I debated if the idea that it could have been better to do whatever the bastard wanted and open the gate to its mainland first, or…</p>
<p>Anyway, time passed by without a call from Doom Kaos. About ten minutes later, I opened a gate in the direction where Yeon-Hee was as I had been thinking all along. Even then, I was concerned about whether I was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>[You have used Gate Formation.]</p>
<p>When I passed through the gate, a land stained with blood unfolded. The bodies of slaughtered orcs were scattered all around, and it didn’t seem long since the battle had ended. Yeon-Hee was alone and was sprinting toward the next flock.</p>
<p>It was the scene that I had been visualizing for a long time. She was full of vitality, without a single biosensor line monitoring her.</p>
<p>Seeing her like that, I found myself trapped in a prison of agony. I had made a wrong decision. My plan was asking too much of her. But, but…</p>
<p>As long as I didn’t forcibly stop her from engaging in battle, there was a high probability that the same thing would happen again. It was directly linked to her safety. Entegasto was not the end as Doom Arukuda would soon start to hold me in check. If Yeon-Hee faced death again and I traveled back in time again, would the pain I suffered then really be nothing? No, no…</p>
<p>When my heart was pounding unstably, Yeon-Hee stopped. I could see her impassive and indifferent face turning toward me. By the time she faced me straight on, a smile spread across her lips. Although her smile was smeared with blood, the corners of her lips rose clearly. Her slightly exposed teeth were clean, and her eyes were shining.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, that smile quickly faded away. By the time she had arrived in front of me, her face was stiffened. She asked, looking straight at me, “What is going on?”</p>
<p>I stated, “Woo Yeon-Hee.”</p>
<p>“Why are you so serious? What on earth…”</p>
<p>I continued, “I don’t want to restrain you.”</p>
<p>“What? That’s it? I thought something terrible happened. We already talked about this. I will be clear, but no, I don’t like it. I am your corps’s priestess. I am the strongest amongst all the Awakened except you. It is such a waste to tell me to stay only on the mainland.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Please don’t forget. Although I am your lover, I am an Awakened too. There is no life for me now on the mainland. If I have to think about life on the mainland…then…it will be after this war is over.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“I am Mary. The Bitch. Do you think the orcs can threaten me? Don’t worry. If anything happens, I will use the returning stone immediately. But who blabbed to you that I am here? Is it Seong-Il? Ah, this guy.”</p>
<p>I stated again, “It was the same before, and it is the same now. I don’t want to restrain you.”</p>
<p>“Then, is it a different issue?” she asked.</p>
<p>I said, “You will die today. I traveled back in time from tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“...What?”</p>
<p>I smiled bitterly. “First, look at my memories.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Memories created in the mental world couldn’t be seen, so the memories that Yeon-Hee could see were only from two time zones. It was only from the moment just before I entered the mental world with the bastard and after I returned from that.</p>
<p>After she saw the memories, she became speechless. There was extreme regret in her eyes as she stared at me. Even if I didn’t have mental attributes, I could certainly feel her emotion. It seemed like she was also moved. She asked with a trembling voice, “How long…how long did you spend in the mental world?”</p>
<p>I shook my head. “I never kept track.”</p>
<p>I continued, “The bastard couldn’t stand it and was on the verge of dying. Even though it was a Demon King.”</p>
<p>I smiled grimly. “From the start, the bastard appeared with injuries all over it.”</p>
<p>She smiled weakly. “But still.”</p>
<p>I added, “You caused major damage to it. I couldn’t see the mental battle with my eyes, but you seemed to have fought against it with an equivalent strength to it.”</p>
<p>The most charming part I found about Yeon-Hee was the wrinkle on her nose when she smiled. However, right now, the wrinkle was spreading from her nose to her cheeks. Her murderous intent wriggled intensely before it quickly subsided.</p>
<p>She finally said, “I am sorry. This is all…because I failed to kill that fly.”</p>
<p>I reassured her, “No. Thanks to you, I was able to obtain the power of time reversal.”</p>
<p>Thinking about the pain she must have suffered when she died made my heart ache. Just because I turned back time didn’t mean that the incident had disappeared from my memories.</p>
<p>“Seon-Hu…how long did you stay there? How could you obtain the Time Reversal insignia…? It is impossible to do so unless you spend years there.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee buried her face in her hands as she couldn’t finish. I held her shaking body and replied, “It was not too bad. There was never a dull moment. Really. Look at me.”</p>
<p>Her eyes were bloodshot.</p>
<p>“Woo Yeon-Hee. You are such a big help. As you can see, you are the only one here. To do something like this, thousands of Awakened should have been here. This is more than enough. But from now on…”</p>
<p>She interrupted, “Okay.”</p>
<p>I hadn’t even finished what I was saying.</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>I knew this would happen. Asking about her intentions had no value in this situation. It was worthless, except to use it as an excuse for myself when something went wrong. I thought I needed to take responsibility for everything that happened afterward.</p>
<p>“From now on, I’d like you to help me in the same vicinity of me.”</p>
<p>[* Storage box]</p>
<p>[Lunea’s Light has been removed.]</p>
<p>“If you use this, your mental power will be enhanced.”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee stared blankly at what I offered. Then she soon started nodding as if she understood my intention. She stopped, then said in a voice filled with deep resentment, “When will that asshole attack me?”</p>
<p>I thought and responded, “Around eleven hours and forty minutes from now.”</p>
<p>“Then, that must be the time that the bastard has before it dies. Don’t worry. I will kill it this time. Thanks for the chance. If not, then I would have…”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee couldn’t finish. When her voice scattered, the accessory was in her hands.</p>
<p>I shook my head. “No, killing the bastard shouldn’t be done here.”</p>
<p>“Huh?” She looked bewildered.</p>
<p>I stated, “At the Demon Kings’ meeting.”</p>
<p>“At the Demon Kings’ meeting?” she asked.</p>
<p>“When the bastard is of no use, Doom Kaos will need one more king. You are going to challenge its position of Doom today.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 437</p>
<p>By the time I had finished instructing Seong-Il and Joshua, Yeon-Hee looked more emotional than usual. Her swordsmanship was usually simple and spotless, but it was somewhat messy now. She was blaming herself, unable to erase her guilt toward me.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why. When the negative effects randomly burst out from the Clown’s Dagger, she actually seemed to have turned into an actual bitch.</p>
<p>By the time we reached the period of her previous death, several orc tribes had been slaughtered. I was hiding my presence. In fact, I was using my Sense in the overlord section to conceal myself instead of using an actual skill to hide. The bastard would never dream that I was lying in an ambush here.</p>
<p>Woooong-</p>
<p>The sound came from the sky. The flow of space started to distort rapidly. In an instant, the bastard squeezed its small body out of the gate. The spot had changed compared to the original place. However, in terms of time, not a single second had changed from the predetermined future. It was the same as I had seen in the bastard’s memory.</p>
<p>Originally, Yeon-Hee turned towards the opened gate at this moment, and the two entered into a mental battle immediately. However, Yeon-Hee stopped moving now. Her eyes, which had been forced to look up at the opening gate before, were now fixed on the orcs rushing towards her.</p>
<p>An orc warrior suddenly struck its own fellow’s head with a large ax as it had missed Yeon-Hee’s head, and Yeon-Hee didn’t react to the appearance of the gate. The bastard tilted its head, wondering why she didn’t care about it. Then, it twisted its body and started to charge toward Yeon-Hee. That was also the moment I hit the ground.</p>
<p>Shhhhhk-!</p>
<p>Odin’s Ethereal Animal was too luxurious for this bastard. I caught it in the air.</p>
<p>[Doom Man…?]</p>
<p>Its surprised face only turned toward me then.</p>
<p>[What are you doing here?]</p>
<p>Lightning bolts began to torment it, and the pressure coming from all directions crushed the bastard’s face. It screamed recklessly in the message.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee then moved to the relocated place. Even then, the bastard was too busy squirming to realize what was happening.</p>
<p>Of course, killing it was easy as I just needed to increase the pressure. Then, I could give death to the bastard, similar to how Entegasto killed Doom Insectum. However, killing it now would not benefit me.</p>
<p>I quickly retrieved the lightning bolts, but the bastard’s airway was still blocked even though I absorbed the last lightning tendril.</p>
<p>In the sensory web, the bastard felt like a physical material. Its wings were fluttering, tickling my hand, but no matter what, it couldn’t escape from me. When I released the pressure on my hand a little, the bastard was finally able to speak.</p>
<p>[What the heck is going on! Ugh-]</p>
<p>[I thought you were nicer than this… Did you really not learn anything from Doom Insectum’s death? Doom Man will end up dying after our Almighty Master…! Doom Arukuda himself will act as the executioner next time, you understand? So please let me go…]</p>
<p>[Or tell me why you are doing this! ٩(๑`ȏ´๑)۶ ]</p>
<p>[We need to talk to clear up misunderstandings. First…let me go…please.]</p>
<p>I snarled, “There is only one way for you to survive. Confess the sins of Entegasto. I know all of your plans.”</p>
<p>[Sins? Plans? I, Lu-neah, don’t understand anything.]</p>
<p>[Yes, I, Lu-neah, am aware that Doom Man and Doom Entegasto do not have a good relationship. However, that is your problem, so please don’t put me in between you guys.]</p>
<p>[Please don’t do this. An innocent Lu-neah will get hurt in a fight.]</p>
<p>The bastard simply responded shamelessly.</p>
<p>I said grimly, “Then, I have no choice but to go to the mainland.”</p>
<p>[What are you going to do by taking Lu-neah to your mainland? I have waited to see a powerful human corps’s mainland with my own eyes, but not in this way!]</p>
<p>“I am talking about your mainland.”</p>
<p>[...That is weird. Why would you want to go to my home?]</p>
<p>Let’s see how long you can act so shamelessly.</p>
<p>I added, “I will head to your warehouse. The memory warehouse.”</p>
<p>The bastard’s face stiffened noticeably at that moment, probably because the pain it had just experienced had not yet subsided. Of course, the spirits were skilled at hiding their true intentions.</p>
<p>The expression the bastard showed disappeared quickly, and the mask it wore was utterly wacky. I was impressed.</p>
<p>[Hehe. I guess no one would want to show their shabby homes. I, Lu-neah, have roughly figured out why you are doing this.]</p>
<p>The fact that it could maintain such a face while suppressing pain was…</p>
<p>[Do you know how deep Lu-neah’s loyalty towards Doom Man is? Please listen. Originally… I, Lu-neah, was supposed to handle it. But since you seem to know everything, I can’t hide it anymore. This was all for the coexistence of Doom Man and our lords.]</p>
<p>[I understand. You completely misunderstood the situation, but it’s okay.]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, am here to warn Doom Man’s priestess. But you knew everything. As expected! You, Doom Man, are amazing. You should have given me a hint!]</p>
<p>“Warning…” I muttered in disbelief.</p>
<p>[This is Lu-neah’s humble opinion, but I think Doom Man has misunderstood the power of Doom Entegasto and the Great Black.]</p>
<p>[The Great Black has been active lately!]</p>
<p>[From what I, Lu-neah, have found out, the Great Black plans to kill Doom Man’s subordinates. That is why Lu-neah rushed to see Doom Man’s priestess like this. I hope this clears up some misunderstandings.]</p>
<p>[I know. It would be hard. So if you can’t believe what I, Lu-neah, said, I will guide you to where the Great Black is now. You can check it yourself!]</p>
<p>The bastard’s eyes moved quickly. It first looked at me, then at Yeon-Hee over my shoulder. It suddenly fell silent and spoke again. Its expression was very familiar to me as it was a unique look that always appeared when it was contemplating its own survival. I had witnessed it several times in the mental world.</p>
<p>[( ･᷄д･᷅ ) The despicable Entegasto will be judged today.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, also feel relieved now. I have been worried… Thank you so much. I, Lu-neah, can finally reveal every sin of Entegasto to our master and Doom Man.]</p>
<p>[However, there is one thing you have to promise me. Please protect Lu-neah from Entegasto. I, Lu-neah, am under Entegasto’s watch.]</p>
<p>[As Doom Man cares for your mainland, I, Lu-neah, will remain loyal to Doom Man forever. You will be surprised to know what else Lu-neah can offer besides loyalty.]</p>
<p>[Oh, right!]</p>
<p>[Don’t worry. Doom Kaos cannot hear what Lu-neah is saying right now.]</p>
<p>“I forgot that you flies talk a lot…”</p>
<p>However, my time in having to deal with such an impertinent being would soon be over.</p>
<p>[I have reduced and simplified it as much as possible. The situation is urgent. I, Lu-neah, have made a once-in-a-lifetime decision. Look. I, Lu-neah, will also find it hard to escape punishment when I stand trial. It is not over yet.]</p>
<p>[The Book of Death!]</p>
<p>The bastard blinked its eyes quickly as I didn’t show the reaction that it expected.</p>
<p>[Ehem… The last volume of the Book of Death! Do you not know what it is?]</p>
<p>[I will explain briefly since we don’t have much time. If all three volumes of the Book of Death are gathered, you can resurrect the ancient Undead Emperor.]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, even know where it is. Here is the important part. If Doom Man advocates for Lu-neah, I will offer it to you. You will naturally figure out by which method.]</p>
<p>[As I have said before, Entegasto is watching Lu-neah. Entegasto is undoubtedly…]</p>
<p>The gaze of the bastard that never moved elsewhere except for me and Yeon-Hee suddenly went up. Its message had also been abruptly cut off. The gate was opening, but the speed wasn’t very fast.</p>
<p>However, the speed at which a massive arm pierced through at the moment that space was ripped apart was insurmountable for anyone but me. The muscles were visible through the broken parts and seams of the black armor. It was still uncovered by skin, and it was oozing red energy like blood.</p>
<p>Entegasto’s arm!</p>
<p>It appeared, filling the ceiling as if to crush us all at once. I soared up to the sky while still holding the bastard with my one hand. The force of Entegasto coming down from above and the force I exuded surging from below collided, then I fell towards the ground.</p>
<p>The first thing I confirmed in my reversed vision was Yeon-Hee’s status. Thankfully, as we had planned, she was nowhere to be found. She promised that she would use the returning stone immediately in case of sudden unexpected situations that didn’t exist in the original future.</p>
<p>[Warning: You lack Power Resistance.]</p>
<p>[Aaaaargh- Please, please let Lu-neah go! Right now! Lu-neah needs to be able to testify, right?]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, am not immortal like you, Doom Man!]</p>
<p>My view was hazy with dust. Was Doom Kaos’s vision also obstructed like this?</p>
<p>I ordered, “Call Doom Kaos.”</p>
<p>[Ah, right… I, Lu-neah, have lost my mind. You promised, okay? You have to advocate for Lu-neah to other lords. Besides the last volume of the Book of Death, Lu-neah is a storehouse of top-grade information, superior to the human army…]</p>
<p>“Hurry up!” I shouted.</p>
<p>[Fine. I told Doom Kaos. Entegasto is in big trouble now!]</p>
<p>Red Power was burning like fire beyond the black helmet. Entegasto’s gigantic body stood tall, connecting the ground and the sky. I was able to clearly see its face as it was looking down at us. Although its intent to kill me and the bastard all at once was strong, it seemed to be more confused now.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been covered by the red energy, then its eyeballs would have been shaking. It appeared like it was asking me this.</p>
<p>How did you know about my plan…</p>
<p>That was when the long-awaited message popped up. A hurried movement was detected from Entegasto, but Doom Kaos’s message was clearer than ever.</p>
<p>[Your Almighty Master Doom Kaos has gathered a meeting with Dooms.]</p>
<p>Perfect. It was now time to proceed to the court.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 438</p>
<p>Mount and Caso looked the same as I remembered them. I could feel the tension through their downcast demeanor. When I looked down, the only one who met my gaze was the bastard, while the rest only showed the backs of their heads.</p>
<p>However, the bastard would stand at the judgment stand with Entegasto. Hence, regardless of its innate cheeky nature, it couldn’t afford to remain completely at ease. The anxiety was evident in its eyes which were still playfully smiling at me.</p>
<p>[You said you would defend me, right?]</p>
<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>[If you fail to defend me properly, I, Lu-neah, will suffer the consequences. Remember how our master handled Insectum.]</p>
<p>I couldn’t tell what was happening beyond the curtain. However, something was undoubtedly occurring there as the entire curtain began to ripple.</p>
<p>I, too, lowered my head from then on. Mount and Caso seemed even more intimidated as they sensed the ominous atmosphere. They were frozen, not even moving a finger like little mice trapped in fear. A division was formed with the curtain as the boundary. The curtain was continuously vibrating, contrary to the stiff atmosphere below.</p>
<p>The bastard’s message appeared much later, directed to all the Dooms.</p>
<p>[Our Master has declared that the matter is of grave importance and will be sorted out on the judgment stand. All lords, be prepared.]</p>
<p>[Don’t ask me what to be ready for because even I, Lu-neah, do not know.]</p>
<p>At first, I wondered what it meant. Soon, the ground shook, and a solemn power broke through the curtain. It emerged like a gust of wind, but soon transformed into a vortex, stirring the space. The force that filled beneath the curtain carried a weight to it. It reminded me of the power of constructing the Time Reversal insignia.</p>
<p>I could withstand it, but the others couldn’t do the same. Under the weight of immense pressure, knees buckled and heads bowed as if coerced by an overpowering force. It felt as if any further increase in power would cause a cataclysmic eruption.</p>
<p>Even I kneeled down and lowered my head.</p>
<p>[There was an accusation leveled by me, Doom Lu-neah, that Doom Entegasto conspired with Doom Lu-neah to orchestrate the demise of Doom Man.]</p>
<p>Next to the staircase, something began to form in a pitch-black void that was previously empty. Nonetheless, it was small and was merely a foothold. Undeniably, it was a stand of judgment for Entegasto.</p>
<p>[Continuous conflicts among our lords are certain to incur the anger of our Almighty Master.]</p>
<p>[So, our master has chosen to personally judge both Doom Entegasto and Doom Lu-neah.]</p>
<p>A colossal figure emerged from beyond the curtain. Just as it had been during the battle, it was not exceedingly towering, only slightly taller than me.</p>
<p>Entegasto stepped on the stand, which coincidentally aligned with my eye level. Its gaze on me was still filled with suspicion. As the bastard flew toward the stand, it finally looked away.</p>
<p>[Our Almighty Master has a message to those lords who are doubting his omniscience, so listen carefully.]</p>
<p>[Our Master is indeed almighty. He sees and hears everything. However, as many of you know, the only entity capable of opposing our Master is the Old One.]</p>
<p>[This incident, where Doom Entegasto and Doom Lu-neah conspired for the death of Doom Man, happened when our Master was confronting the Old One.]</p>
<p>...What the hell is it saying? It happened while Doom Kaos was dealing with the Old One?</p>
<p>I thought Entegasto had been blocking Doom Kaos’s view.</p>
<p>[If that was not the case, then the perpetrator of this event would have been immediately punished by our Master, the omniscient one. Even Doom Entegasto could not be an exception.]</p>
<p>[He hopes everyone learns a lot from this trial. Then…]</p>
<p>[Our omnipotent and Almighty Master will begin the trial!]</p>
<p>The curtain shook fiercely again, and it was a powerful command from Doom Kaos that made me open my mouth.</p>
<p>[Our Master has decided to hear from Doom Man first. Doom Man, please begin~]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>I received the right to speak.</p>
<p>“Everyone knows that Doom Entegasto harbors animosity against me. Despite that, I never expected Doom Entegasto to plot my murder. Why do you think so? I am the vanguard. I am carrying the burden, including the responsibility of the injured Doom Arukuda, Doom Entegasto, and other lower lords who have yet to release the seal of the Great Red.”</p>
<p>I gulped before continuing.</p>
<p>“Although Entegasto has a grudge against me, I think it would have understood what kind of sin it would be to forsake our Master’s will and conspire for my death. To achieve victory in the war, we lords must fulfill our master’s orders instead of being swayed by personal feelings.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>“Thus, I thought Entegasto would fulfill the duties of a loyal subject first. I believed that it, too, would control its emotions to offer victory to our Master. However, Entegasto has conspired with Lunea and ended up plotting for my death. But its greatest sin is not that.”</p>
<p>That was enough for the introduction, and it was time to move on to the main point.</p>
<p>“Lunea said that it had no choice but to comply with Entegasto’s coercion.”</p>
<p>Then, I looked at the bastard. It had been waiting for this moment as well.</p>
<p>[Hehe, good job! I, Lu-neah, will take over.]</p>
<p>[Also, I will borrow your tone a bit. That would be more effective to deliver messages to our Master. So, don’t complain, okay?]</p>
<p>The bastard was unable to bear the furious gaze of Entegasto, so it flew higher. Entegasto raised its head and continued to stare at the tiny spirit.</p>
<p>[Why would I ever lie in this circumstance?]</p>
<p>[I am much weaker than Doom Man. Planning Doom Man’s death? I am not foolish enough to plan such a thing alone.]</p>
<p>[One of the reasons why our Master values Lu-neah so highly is precisely because of my ‘wisdom.’]</p>
<p>[I will confess to you, my master, without any false flattery. Doom Entegasto summoned and threatened Lu-neah to kill Doom Man.]</p>
<p>[I had no choice but to follow its orders. No, I had no choice but to pretend to obey.]</p>
<p>[I know. The sin of not immediately telling you, my lord, the truth at the time is an unforgivable sin. But I could not do so. This is because I knew that our Master’s will lie in the victory of the war.]</p>
<p>[Entegasto dared to disobey your orders and kill Doom Man? How could I possibly report that? I would have been free from Doom Entegasto’s threat, but that would be all.]</p>
<p>[How angry would our Master have been? Our Master would have no choice but to punish Entegasto, a long-time faithful servant. How devastated would our Master’s heart be?]</p>
<p>[Ultimately, if our Master punishes Entegasto, it would have only been good for the Old One’s faction.]</p>
<p>[Doom Entegasto was consumed by rage and plotted a futile act, but it was out of personal feelings towards Doom Man. We all know of Entegasto’s loyalty to you, my Master. That loyalty is something we, your subordinates, should emulate.]</p>
<p>[Therefore, I am willing to accept all punishments and quietly resolve everything.]</p>
<p>[My Master… I plead with you. Please. Please calm your anger. Doom Entegasto must also be deeply repentant over this incident.]</p>
<p>[Also, please recognize my loyalty. Please consider that the sin I committed is great, but it was all to bring you victory… Lu-neah is also deeply repentant over this incident.]</p>
<p>[I will accept punishment, but please spare my life. I will never casually judge your will again.]</p>
<p>[I… I had no choice this time…]</p>
<p>The bastard didn’t stop at following my tone, but it stayed conscious of it even after the trial ended. It appeared to be walking a tightrope between Entegasto and me, but such a future that it was preparing for would never come as today would be its last day.</p>
<p>Then, the bastard looked at me with a face asking me to defend it.</p>
<p>[Please tell the Master how deep my loyalty is. Even if you have to make up a story… Please make it as long as possible. Please use your imagination, Doom Man! Lu-neah will play along with whatever you say. Hurry! Hurry~!]</p>
<p>I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>“Before the trial began, our Master said he did not know the details of this case because he was facing the Old One.”</p>
<p>[W…wait. What are you…trying to say?]</p>
<p>“But Lunea once told me that Entegasto was covering the Master’s eyes with his power and that the master could not know what was happening back then. Therefore, I have some doubts. If Entegasto intentionally blocked your view, then that would be the biggest crime that Entegasto has committed.”</p>
<p>[ (｡◕ˇдˇ◕｡) What the heck are you saying?]</p>
<p>The bastard sent a message to me instantly.</p>
<p>[When did Lu-neah say that? Are you trying to frame Entegasto by making up a story?]</p>
<p>[Cancel that right now! Entegasto will be driven into a corner now!]</p>
<p>[Master won’t kill Entegasto then. Even after the judgment, Entegasto will live and continue to threaten Lu-neah! Please…]</p>
<p>The bastard sent me messages like that, but…</p>
<p>[No! I have never said such a thing. I think Doom Man has misunderstood or perhaps misinterpreted something I said!]</p>
<p>It raised its voice beyond the curtain. However, Entegasto was the one who was actually flustered, not Lunea. The murderous intent emanating from Entegasto as it glared at Lunea was perceived as bewilderment to me.</p>
<p>The bastard shuddered as it looked at me.</p>
<p>[This will not work.]</p>
<p>[Do you actually not know what the Book of Death is? When all three books are gathered, it will cause a tremendous power to emerge. Entegasto had to disperse them out of fear of that. Are you not curious about where the last volume is? Are you not going to make your priest the Undead Emperor?]</p>
<p>[Ugh… Come on. Let’s stick to the script. It will be a win-win situation.]</p>
<p>[For Doom Man, it is a golden opportunity to not only gain Lu-neah but also the strength of the entire spirit tribe. And even the Undead Emperor. Please retract your previous words immediately!]</p>
<p>Entegasto’s gaze shifted from Lunea to above the curtain. It also appeared to be starting a refutation. Every now and then, it glanced at Lunea, and its body trembled uncontrollably in rage.</p>
<p>After a moment…</p>
<p>[Don’t resent Lu-neah, Doom Man. It is only because you didn’t follow the script first. You have ruined what could have been a symbiotic relationship.]</p>
<p>[My Master. Please kill Lu-neah. I will confess everything as it is. I have committed a great sin again. I deserve death as I have outraged both the Master and Doom Entegasto.]</p>
<p>[This was all a play by Doom Man to take the place of Doom Entegasto.]</p>
<p>[He promised to return one Book of Death and my necklace if I cooperated.]</p>
<p>[Doom Man said…]</p>
<p>I shouted out as well, “Oh, my Master! Please execute Entegasto. Also, please give me the last volume of the Book of Death that Entegasto is currently holding. Please don’t worry about Entegasto’s absence. I will take over its duties as well!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 439</p>
<p>The bastard was chattering nonstop. It was slandering me, and it sounded quite plausible for something that was made up on the spot. It had completely turned to Entegasto’s side, but it knew that this choice wouldn’t be its lifeline.</p>
<p>Its previously relaxed expression had long since disappeared. It seemed desperate, as if it was sensing its dark future. The more it talked, the more its face seemed to sink into a swamp.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I had been silent since I asked for the execution of Entegasto. Entegasto was a card that was hard to give up. Simply by considering its accomplishments, it was the one who stood at the forefront in the old battlefield against Saint Jayden, the Great Red, as a vanguard. Also, it could overwhelm me if it recovered from its injury.</p>
<p>Therefore, it would be difficult for Doom Kaos to abandon such a guy. I had once faced the same dilemma as Doom Kaos was experiencing. That was when Jessica, Gillian’s wife, had stabbed me in the back. Back then, I forgave her even though she betrayed the club and me. Doom Kaos would be in the same scenario as Entegasto still had a lot of use left.</p>
<p><strong>[...That was Doom Man’s one-man show, Master. Doom Man should be punished severely. The same goes for Lu-neah, who cooperated with Doom Man. I take this opportunity to apologize once again to Doom Entegasto.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[That is it. (╥﹏╥) Please punish us all, Almighty Master.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[I, Lu-neah, am not qualified to be a lord along with Doom Man.]</strong></p>
<p>The bastard tried to sink me down with it like a water demon, but I remained still. After all, the judge was the master of the throne, Doom Kaos. It had to be aware that time had been turned back and the conversation I had with Yeon-Hee. In other words, it knew why I had no choice but to turn back time.</p>
<p>If that was not the case, then it was the biggest fool in the world. It wouldn’t deserve its current title. Well, that wasn’t a bad scenario either…</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Doom Kaos’s power made the place solemn, and everyone was waiting for the judgment. Entegasto stood upright, and Lunea was floating quietly without fluttering its wings too much.</p>
<p>Mount and Caso were carefully gathering their strength. It seemed like they were preparing for what was about to happen, as if they remembered the time when Entegasto tried to execute me a while ago.</p>
<p><strong>[Our Almighty Master will now judge. We lords should hold our breath.]</strong></p>
<p>Then, it sent another message immediately.</p>
<p><strong>[Doom Entegasto is…]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[...ordered to join the battlefield instantly.]</strong></p>
<p>Lunea turned pale even though it was the one that delivered the message itself. The bastard turned to me and said.</p>
<p>[I knew this would happen! Doom Entegasto must have regained his position as a vanguard! I, Lu-neah, and Entegasto have won. Hehehe~ It’s too late for Doom Man to regret!]</p>
<p>[By the way, I can’t believe how dumb you are! Did you not expect this to happen? You underestimated Lu-neah’s ability!]</p>
<p>[But don’t worry. Master won’t give you a death sentence either.]</p>
<p>[Doom Arukuda will come down soon. Do you remember what you did to Lu-neah last time? Doom Arukuda will probably do the same to you.]</p>
<p>The bastard’s voice rose in joy, but I was not disturbed at all. It was too preoccupied with mocking me without realizing what kind of atmosphere Entegasto was being sucked into…</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the bastard finally turned its head toward Entegasto, who was in shock. From the way it looked up at the curtain, it was obvious that it was in disbelief by the verdict. Doom Kaos seemed to have issued an order to Entegasto, and it appeared to be extremely difficult, with no certainty of life or death.</p>
<p>I looked up at the curtain. I was waiting just in case, but there was no sign of Doom Arukuda revealing itself.</p>
<p><strong>[...Before Doom Entegasto leaves for the battlefield…]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[The Master ordered Doom Entegasto to hand over the last volume of the Book of Death to Doom Man…]</strong></p>
<p>The bastard said with a ghastly pale face. Finally, Entegasto accepted the result and lowered its head. Lunea’s face was so distorted to the point where it couldn’t be worse. Even though it had to fix its expression quickly, it couldn’t afford to do so. Only after the bastard looked at me did it barely manage to fix its expression. It had a hollow smile, uncomfortably unnatural.</p>
<p>[Umm… Mmm… Lu-neah is very bewildered. I am not sure what to say to be forgiven. I won’t ask for forgiveness.]</p>
<p>[Instead, Lu-neah will dedicate all of Lu-neah’s to you.]</p>
<p>[There is a ‘memory warehouse’ in Lu-neah’s homeland. Advanced tribes like Lu-neah can share memories and emotions with each other.]</p>
<p>[Please listen to the end. I am aware that Doom Man knows about the memory warehouse. However, Doom Man only knows of its existence, not how to acquire it. I am certain.]</p>
<p>[If you acquire it, you can enslave Lu-neah. My tribe will be a bonus.]</p>
<p>[Doom Man’s human corps seem to have excellent information, but think about it. If you add Lu-neah’s information on top of it, your power will grow tremendously.]</p>
<p>[Please… Okay? Please… Please defend me. Our Master will listen if you speak up for me.]</p>
<p>The speed of the messages pouring out now was the fastest the bastard had ever shown.</p>
<p><strong>[Lu-neah’s judgment will begin now.]</strong></p>
<p>[Please… Please! I beg you. You can make Lu-neah your slave. Will you really feel better if Lu-neah dies? Really? Is that what you actually want?]</p>
<p>[Before I am sentenced to death… Please… Aaah… No… No…]</p>
<p>It was entertaining to see its expression changing. Then, it soon stiffened.</p>
<p><strong>[I, Lu-neah, should…]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Join the battlefield immediately!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Doom Entegasto was ordered to break the barrier of the Old One’s power in Elsland. I, Lu-neah, am ordered to kill the Spirit King by mobilizing my entire clan!]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Regardless of victory or defeat, this will be a great help in the future battles Doom Man must fight.]</strong></p>
<p>The message did not end there.</p>
<p><strong>[Also, the Almighty Master has decided to cancel one order in order to console Doom Man’s efforts. The promised reward will be given though. Doom Man must repay the grace given by our Master.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[You have completed the order ‘Speed Up the Occupation.’]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Please specify the location where you would like to build the Demon Castle.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[* Do not rush. The time to specify is not limited. Please consider the best location of the Demon Castle to benefit your human corps.]</strong></p>
<p>Originally, I was a part of the Old One’s side, but then I switched to Doom Kaos’s. I had been growing steadily. Now, further growth was assured through the trait Extractor.</p>
<p>Moreover, I had recently gained the power of Time Reversal. Perhaps because of that, I felt an intense consciousness of whether I would disobey Doom Kaos’s judgment. I didn’t expect it would cancel one of its orders and still reward me. Indeed, my strong request for Doom Entegasto’s execution had not been in vain.</p>
<p><i><strong>[Please specify the location where you would like to build the Demon Castle.]</strong></i></p>
<p>Look. A tempting message flashed before my eyes. It indicated that Doom Kaos considered me a significant subordinate. It was the gesture of Doom Kaos that insisted I should not change my mind from now on.</p>
<p><i>(* Your Demon Castle will be protected by your Master’s power.)</i></p>
<p>I could now provide a safe zone for the Awakened, and I believed the Demon Castle would play its role against any transcendent attack. When I lowered my head towards the curtain, something rushed towards me from the direction where Entegasto was.</p>
<p><i>Sheeeeek-!</i></p>
<p>It was a power that the lower lords could never withstand, but Entegasto didn’t use its full power. Although I needed to raise my Strength to the Overlord section, I would have had to activate the Man Who Overcomes Adversity if Entegasto used its full strength.</p>
<p>It was the last volume of the Book of Death.</p>
<p>[*Inventory]</p>
<p>[‘Book of Death Volume 3’ has been added.]</p>
<p>Entegasto turned with its face full of rage and walked away. The gate quickly opened and closed. Now, only the bastard was left on the stand. However, it just stared blankly at the spot where Entegasto disappeared without any special reaction. It seemed to have decided to complain to me.</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, am overwhelmed with simply blocking the entrance to the spirit world. But killing the Spirit King? Mobilizing my entire clan? That is basically ordering us to gloriously self-immolate ourselves in flames.]</p>
<p>[If I, Lu-neah, and all my children are exterminated, it will be a headache for Doom Man as well.]</p>
<p>[The atmosphere is built up now, Doom Man. Please tell our Master just one thing. I will never forget what you will do for me. Take my memory warehouse and take me, Lu-neah, and all my children as slaves.]</p>
<p>[We will serve you all our life. Devoting my sincere loyalty to you~]</p>
<p>I ignored it. The bastard’s desperate gaze began to fade slowly. Eventually, it turned into a face full of malice, like how the Guides had acted.</p>
<p>[I guess I have no choice. I gave you multiple chances, but you ignored them, okay?]</p>
<p>[?(?`н′?)? This is not the end for Doom Lu-neah and Doom Entegasto. Doom Arukuda will also not look kindly on Doom Man. Haha… You understand what Lu-neah is saying, right?]</p>
<p>[You will have to live being conscious of us nonstop. Like a fool.]</p>
<p>[I will see you next time then.]</p>
<p>When the bastard was about to leave following Entegasto, its eyes bulged out.</p>
<p><strong>[Doom Man’s priests, Osiris and Caliber, have completed the ritual ‘Mammonism.’]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Wish: Allow Doom Man’s priestess, Mary’s ‘challenge.’]</strong></p>
<p>[What…what the hell have you been doing?]</p>
<p><strong>[Your Master has responded.]</strong></p>
<p><strong>[Your priest, Mary, has obtained the ‘challenge (Doom Mary).’]</strong></p>
<p>It was from the stand, which became empty after Entegasto left.</p>
<p><i>Whoosh-!</i></p>
<p>The space ripped open and Yeon-Hee was bounced out from there. I immediately lunged and pulled her shoulder toward me. Although she was in an unfamiliar place, she did not seem flustered.</p>
<p>She silently mouthed ‘Thank you,’ then landed on the ground. Then, she turned her head and murmured quietly, “Are you ready? You piece of shit.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 440</p>
<p>A small light burst from Yeon-Hee’s neck, then disappeared. Her mental strength had been further enhanced.</p>
<p>[Master! It is unfair for Doom Man’s priest to wear my, Lu-neah’s, necklace.]</p>
<p>The bastard objected toward the curtain, but of course, there was no reply. I returned to my spot from the judgment stand. Yeon-Hee had been solely focused on the bastard after landing. Her will to fight against the bastard was strongly conveyed even to this distant place.</p>
<p>However, it was not the case with the bastard. It was facing Yeon-Hee, but its gaze was fixed only on the necklace she was wearing.</p>
<p>“What the hell are you whining about? This one? You can take it back if you knock me down.”</p>
<p>The bastard ignored Yeon-Hee and yelled at the curtain again.</p>
<p>[Okay, fine. Then, please promise me that Doom Man will not intervene.]</p>
<p>[Is it really okay if I, Lu-neah, kill that audacious girl? Please confirm that. I, Lu-neah, will not be responsible for the outcome of this matter.]</p>
<p>It also sent me messages.</p>
<p>[I wonder if Doom Man has tears. We will find that out soon.]</p>
<p>[Prepare to hold a funeral. You must have underestimated me so much that you sent such a girl. I am certain that you will regret… ah!]</p>
<p>The bastard’s message was abruptly cut off as Yeon-Hee lunged at it. Her eyes were filled with pitch-black darkness.</p>
<p>“You should focus on me!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>No one could peek into a mental world. Even for Doom Kaos, it was impossible unless it directly entered the world. Therefore, I couldn’t tell how long Yeon-Hee and the bastard had fought. But I could tell how intense their fight had been.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee was flung away with a distorted expression, and the bastard that collapsed similarly was missing one wing. That was why it was falling uncontrollably in the air without being able to maintain its balance. However, its fall was slower than Yeon-Hee’s because the remaining wing was still flapping.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee couldn’t find her balance until she hit the ground. Her forehead first hit the bottom step. The sound of the impact echoed through the space, making me flinch momentarily.</p>
<p>She stood up with a shimmering barrier around her entire body. The barrier didn’t absorb all of the impact. What she spat out before she looked up was mixed with dark red blood. The fortunate thing was that her internal damage wasn’t as severe to the point she needed to use a recovery skill, so she didn’t activate Mary’s Touch.</p>
<p>Sheeek!</p>
<p>She once again threw herself at the bastard, and she was targeting its remaining wing. Her dagger was so fast it left a trajectory. However, the bastard had been watching her all along, so it managed to dodge without a problem. It narrowly forced its way into space. Then, it appeared, creating an exit in the direction of Yeon-Hee, while simultaneously generating pressure that condensed the space.</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s reaction was incredibly swift. It was definitely challenging for her abilities to respond so instantaneously, but she managed it smoothly. She had anticipated the bastard’s counterattack.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, the same applied to the bastard. Just as Yeon-Hee had an idea of the bastard’s next action, it was also adept at evading her dagger. They attacked and dodged several times. During this time, neither of them managed to land a hit. Only the two trajectories, Yeon-Hee’s dagger and the bastard’s, intertwined.</p>
<p>The fight seemed far from over because they were now familiar with each others’ capabilities through the mental world. However, there was a very slight difference. Yeon-Hee was the one leading the attack! The bastard was primarily counterattacking.</p>
<p>Then, when their gazes directly clashed, the bastard’s appearance changed in an instant, as if a part of a video frame had been cut out. One of its wings that was there just a moment ago had vanished. Also, there were multiple wounds on its body, caused by being stabbed and cut by the dagger.</p>
<p>The bastard yelled out as it collapsed.</p>
<p>[Master!]</p>
<p>[Why are you not lending me your power?! Please allow me to summon the original body!]</p>
<p>[That girl is also wearing Lu-neah’s necklace!]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The bastard was non-material, so the stairs couldn’t be explained by common sense. It collided with the staircase and bounced off. It fell again and bounced off again. As this repeated, the height at which it bounced back naturally decreased.</p>
<p>When the bastard could barely stick to the ground, Yeon-Hee came into my view. She didn’t collide with the ground this time as she was able to regain her balance during the fall. There was no problem up to this point, but she was barely standing. She was wrapping her head with both hands, including the one that was holding the dagger.</p>
<p>I couldn’t see her face from where I was standing. However, I could tell just from the strength in her fingers how much she was grimacing in pain. She was undoubtedly in agony and struggling. She seemed consumed by a pain that felt like her skull was going to break, unable to focus on anything else.</p>
<p>[Please allow me to summon the original body! That too is the power of Lu-neah!]</p>
<p>[This is not a fair fight, Master. I, Lu-neah, cannot accept this.]</p>
<p>The bastard writhed from where it had collapsed. Then, it suddenly became quiet and looked at Yeon-Hee. It stared for a long time. Despite this, Yeon-Hee only put more strength in her hands to hold her head. Then, the bastard stood up and walked stealthily like a mouse going to put a bell on a cat’s neck. As it approached Yeon-Hee, its stride, and speed decreased. Then it tilted its head and looked up at me.</p>
<p>[Oops, what should we do? I think I, Lu-neah, won! (๑☉ᴗ☉)۶ ]</p>
<p>[Don’t blame Lu-neah. You should have considered Lu-neah’s full capabilities before trying to take away my position. Did you really think that a mere priestess could take down Lu-neah?]</p>
<p>[If you are thinking of intervening, don’t even dream about it. Master is watching us right now.]</p>
<p>[Okay, then~ How should I kill her? Should I tear her eye muscles and make her blind first? (◐.◑) Nah, that is lame. I should do something more than what Doom Man has done to me… Please let me know if you have a great idea.]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, am ready to accept any idea~♪ ]</p>
<p>[Hey, why are you so quiet? Where did the torturer go? The newbie is eager to learn, hehe.]</p>
<p>Fucking piece of shit. Such a persistent asshole. It wouldn’t be enough even if I crushed it right now.</p>
<p>[Don’t get too angry. I’d really want to kill you too.]</p>
<p>[I will offer you something that you won’t be able to refuse.]</p>
<p>[In return for sparing the priestess, give back the three Books of Death and what you took from Lu-neah. Make a vow of the soul right here while the Master is watching.]</p>
<p>[That is all I want. Lu-neah is at a loss. Lu-neah is being too generous. Someday, this good nature will be a big blow. Isn’t that right? Isn’t Lu-neah being too kind?]</p>
<p>The bastard didn’t stop talking.</p>
<p>[...But Doom Man is too evil. The priestess is your girl, right? It is really wicked to abandon your lover for a mere item. Am I too honest? Oopsy.]</p>
<p>[Anyway, there is nothing I can do if you don’t answer. It’s finally time for death!]</p>
<p>[Do you really want me to kill her?]</p>
<p>I was focusing on assessing Yeon-Hee’s condition, but the bastard’s messages kept interrupting.</p>
<p>[Hey, Lu-neah is deadly serious. Should I actually kill her?]</p>
<p>[Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I? Should I?]</p>
<p>However, the bastard was just circling around Yeon-Hee without getting closer to her. Its messages felt like cries for a ceasefire. I could finally see Yeon-Hee’s face from afar as I stepped down the stairs to where Mount and Caso were standing. Although she was wringing her head, her eyes were following the movement of the bastard circling around.</p>
<p>[Really… I can’t help it. I don’t know why Lu-neah is so kind. Okay, I will stop here.]</p>
<p>[Let’s untangle the emotions between Doom Man and Lu-neah this way since Lu-neah spared the life of Doom Man’s priestess.]</p>
<p>[Doom Man better hurry. Tell the Master before Lu-neah changes his mind. Hurry. I am still debating.]</p>
<p>The bastard was deliberately avoiding Yeon-Hee’s gaze.</p>
<p>[The fight is over. Doom Man’s priestess failed the challenge.]</p>
<p>Does it end if it says it is over?</p>
<p>The bastard shouted the same thing towards the curtain above, but Doom Kaos still didn’t answer. Doom Kaos was definitely making the same judgment as me.</p>
<p>[Oh, my! You guys are so frustrating! You really want to see the end, right? Okay, got it!]</p>
<p>[I, Lu-neah, will blow that audacious girl’s head!]</p>
<p>The bastard’s face finally became serious. It pointed at Yeon-Hee’s neck with a tiny finger. There, it condensed the space and let the power burst. Yeon-Hee’s head was thrown back violently, and her pair of earrings shattered. It seemed to have affected the other pieces of her equipment as well.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, when Yeon-Hee’s head returned to its place…</p>
<p>Pat!-</p>
<p>She rushed towards the bastard. Her arms, which had been holding her head, were moving according to her own acquired swordsmanship.</p>
<p>Ah! This is why I didn’t want to mess with her! Damn it. Damn it. Damn it!!!</p>
<p>That was what was written on the bastard’s face for a second.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The bastard could no longer fly, but it was able to move freely through space. However, its movement had noticeably slowed down. Although Yeon-Hee’s face was contorted in pain, she was working its socks off. She was aware that her end was nearing.</p>
<p>The battle did not last long. Yeon-Hee predicted the direction from where the bastard would emerge from space and landed her attack. The dagger flashed ominously for the first time, but the negative effect from the dagger was apparently not effective on the bastard. The real deal was when the second attack landed.</p>
<p>The trait, Death! Black energy spread all over the bastard, centered on the cut spot. It almost appeared like veins that were prominently filled with a black substance, and it was then without a doubt that the bastard realized it couldn’t confront Yeon-Hee in a physical battle. Until now, it had been avoiding a mental battle with Yeon-Hee, but from that moment, it no longer avoided her gaze.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, the spectacle of the bastard entering Yeon-Hee’s body and being bounced out was clearly captured when I heightened my Sense. The scene of it entering was not important. When it came out, it looked horrible, like it had appeared when it had to endlessly roam the infinite stage by my order before, having lost its wings.</p>
<p>Now! This is the perfect timing!</p>
<p>I screamed inwardly as I hoped Yeon-Hee would finish the battle without further delay. She screamed as she bent her waist, falling onto the bastard.</p>
<p>“Aaaaaaargh!”</p>
<p>Yeon-Hee’s dagger, which was quickly reversed in her hand, was aiming directly at the bastard’s face. It was probably because her scream was tormenting me as well. The series of movements of her falling towards the bastard and stabbing its face with the dagger appeared to be seen frame by frame.</p>
<p>Then, it was the last frame. In the scene after, she twisted the dagger that had been thrust the bastard’s face with all her might, the bastard shattered like glass and fell into pieces. Those pieces began to disappear into thin air like smoke.</p>
<p>[Doom Lu-neah has died.]</p>
<p>[Doom Mary has succeeded the position of Doom Lu-neah.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 441</p>
<p>The paper bills, which not only filled the altar but also the entire ceremonial room, evaporated in an instant. It was because of the ritual ‘Mammonism.’ All the abundant bills vanished without a trace.</p>
<p>In fact, Seong-Il was not perturbed by the burning of the amount of money he would probably never see again. It was the money he earned to perform the ritual anyway. However, what filled him with dread was the noise that echoed throughout the room. Each and every bill emitted a medley of laughter and tears as if they were releasing the pent-up joys and sorrows of humanity, including his laughter.</p>
<p>The Demon King Doom Kaos was indeed special, and it seemed to be worth spending that much money on the ritual. Doom Kaos possessed an uncanny understanding of what humanity cherished the most. While other monster corps were required to offer their lives as a condition for wishes, humans were expected to offer money. Seong-Il found that deeply repugnant.</p>
<p>He didn’t mind the toil he endured to earn that money, nor did he care about being penniless again. However, as the bills dissipated and the room resounded with a chorus of laughter and sorrows, he felt that this was the worst hell ever.</p>
<p>The battlefield, where bodies were flying around, seemed more serene in comparison. There were only screams and cries there, not manic laughter that chilled Seong-Il’s spine.</p>
<p>“Fuck… I thought I was losing my mind. So much damn absurd noise.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il deliberately raised his voice, but Osiris didn’t even spare him a glance. Although they couldn’t communicate due to the language barrier, Seong-Il still desired to be friends with him. He wasn’t fluent in English, but he could understand it.</p>
<p>However, Osiris promptly left once the ritual concluded. Seong-Il gazed at his back and rose from his seat as well.</p>
<p>That guy seems to be the true Demon King. He only regained his composure… but he still sends shivers down my spine. Fine. You are dark as hell and arrogant as fuck.</p>
<p>There were primarily three reasons why Seong-Il wanted to interact with Osiris.</p>
<p>First, when Mary ascended to the throne, only he and Osiris would remain among the priests in outer space. There would be occasions when they would need to prepare for rituals upon Odin’s urgent orders, and Osiris would inevitably be his sole companion during those moments. Therefore, he wished to establish a connection beforehand to avoid future awkwardness.</p>
<p>Secondly, Osiris bore the largest share among the numerous unfavorable rumors circulating in outer space. It was said that he commanded the dead and had Draculas as his subordinates.</p>
<p>However, it was not mere gossip because that was why he could defend the western front with a small number of Awakened who used to be in his group in the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>If Osiris truly led a malevolent entity within his corps, then it was Seong-Il’s responsibility to keep a vigilant eye, hopefully in the vicinity, using friendship. Seong-Il had to check if Osiris was plotting something against Odin or not. Even if Osiris was loyal now, there could be a possibility in the future.</p>
<p>Upon reflection, the power that Osiris possessed was far from insignificant. His capability as both an Awakened and a leader of the Corps of Darkness that defended the entire western front was indeed unbelievable.</p>
<p>Seong-Il believed such power was enough to wage a war against humanity. Of course, no one would even have imagined doing so, but he couldn’t forget the incident that occurred at the Stage of Advent.</p>
<p>Odin had disappeared at one point, and it was only in the Final Stage, after ten years or so, that Seong-Il met him again. During the time Odin was absent, the Stage of Advent had become a world of ignoble beings. Seong-Il wanted to smash their heads multiple times, but he needed their cooperation to complete the stage. He had to soothe, berate, and lead them somehow.</p>
<p>He had such a headache for years with Lee Tae-Han. Seong-Il never wanted to consider such a case, but both the mainland and outer space were moving within the order set by Odin. So, if Odin were to suddenly disappear one day, the biggest threat to humanity would be…</p>
<p>Not the transcendent beings or anything like that, but it would perhaps be Osiris.</p>
<p>It is terrifying to even think about it. Let’s not even imagine that.</p>
<p>Seong-Il frowned, remembering Osiris’s cold gaze.</p>
<p>Nah. no one knows what others think other than Mary noona. I should prevent this before it actually happens.</p>
<p>It was at that moment when Osiris disappeared outside the secret passage entrance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seong-Il lost track of Osiris halfway as Osiris turned into a pool of blood on the ground, seeping into the wall and vanishing. Seong-Il swept the wall with his fingers where Osiris had seeped into. However, it was spotless, without a trace of blood. The spot where the pool of blood had formed at first was now clean.</p>
<p>My attacks won’t work if he is like this.</p>
<p>There was only one thing he could understand from witnessing Osiris’s bizarre skill. Like Mary noona, he was also wary of the eyes of the association’s employees! Well, it was obvious as such a tycoon with enough money to control the world didn’t show any regret about the mainland. He considered people on Earth as different species and didn’t intend to return there.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head, then headed towards Lee Tae-Han’s office. He encountered employees on the way there and shared countless greetings with them.</p>
<p>Whether they had heard rumors about him or they couldn’t ignore Korea’s influence within the association, the foreigners even said ‘hi’ in Korean with a stuttering pronunciation. That started to ease the serious look on Seong-Il’s face.</p>
<p>However, when he got close to Lee Tae-Han’s office…</p>
<p>Huh? Did Osiris get here first?</p>
<p>Seong-Il could feel the waves stirring inside. It was a special wave that only the Awakened in the challenger section could use, which Odin had named ‘telepathy.’ Then, they disappeared like a lie when Seong-Il arrived.</p>
<p>He walked into the room. He couldn’t overhear what kind of conversation was going on due to the characteristics of telepathy.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, Seong-Il could guess the conversation topic because of the transparent expression on Tae-Han’s face. It was a look Seong-Il had not seen in a long time. Lee Tae-Han only showed that expression when he was faced with a serious challenge in the Stage of Advent. Seong-Il had always been the one resolving Lee Tae-Han’s issues, so he knew what was going on.</p>
<p>“...Do you have a problem with Osiris?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One of the lessons Seong-Il gained from the Stage of Advent was that people tended to be intoxicated by the power they acquired. In other words, people often needed a lot of support from people around them to gain power. Once they gained such strength, they tended to take it for granted.</p>
<p>At that point, individuals regarded their own opinions as the epitome of justice and were ensnared in the illusion of being the most influential figure in the world, flattered by the people around them.</p>
<p>Moreover, Lee Tae-Han was a de facto leader of the World Awakened Association. Odin was the true ‘leader,’ but practically all operations were handled under the control of Lee Tae-Han.</p>
<p>He was also the one who attended all the official events of the association in the world. The power that he was enjoying was definitely on a different scale from what was enjoyed in the Stage of Advent. It was a power that encompassed the whole world, so it was undoubtedly a lot.</p>
<p>Even though Tae-Han is a wise person, no one knows how he might have changed inside. Just as no one knows the thoughts of Osiris.</p>
<p>Seong-Il opened his mouth, feeling the cold air in the room like the gaze of Osiris.</p>
<p>“Hey, I am asking, bro. Do you have a problem with Osiris?”</p>
<p>“Yes,” responded Lee Tae-Han.</p>
<p>Seong-Il asked, “Why?”</p>
<p>“It seems there was a misunderstanding in the message I sent a while ago.”</p>
<p>“What kind of misunderstanding…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il was not in the mood to smile. He raised his Sense and looked around, but he couldn’t feel Osiris’s presence. He continued after checking even the smallest cracks in the walls for any sign of blood seeping in.</p>
<p>Seong-Il stated, “I think there is no one who knows you better than I do.”</p>
<p>“What are you trying to say?” asked Lee Tae-Han.</p>
<p>“You are smart, so you would know what I mean. Do not provoke Osiris.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean? I did not provoke him at all.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head. “Nothing good will come from provoking him. What was the message that he misunderstood? Let me see that.”</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han knew he wouldn’t beat Seong-Il’s stubbornness, so he handed him his tablet PC without wasting time.</p>
<p>「 Dear Osiris,</p>
<p>This is Lee Tae-Han. Thanks to your defense of the Land of Whirlpool, the Association was able to concentrate on seizing the central region. We would like to express gratitude towards you for your efforts through this letter. In addition, I am writing this to tell you an important matter about Mana…」</p>
<p>“Osiris has a reason to be upset. Your intentions can be clearly seen. Even without your checks, Osiris has no attachment to the mainland. You must be aware of this.”</p>
<p>Only then a smile appeared on Seong-Il’s face, but it was an uneasy smile.</p>
<p>“You are misunderstanding this as well,” Lee Tae-Han said.</p>
<p>Seong-Il shook his head. “No. I know what you are wary of. Odin once told me that people don't act for simply one reason. Their intentions can actually incredibly complex and calculated.”</p>
<p>“...”</p>
<p>Seong-Il continued, “You wouldn’t have been just checking him, bro. Osiris is not normal these days. He carries scary things like Dracula and zombies.”</p>
<p>“Hyung.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“According to recent reports, he is also…controlling ghouls.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il shrugged. “Ghouls? They are really annoying. Anyway, I get what you are thinking. I have plans, so let me just ask you a favor.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Do not stir up trouble by unnecessarily messing with Osiris, who is doing just fine. Let’s just keep doing what we have been doing. If any problem arises, I, Caliber, will handle it.”</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han fell silent. Since he didn’t lower his head, the deep thought in his eyes was clearly visible. When Seong-Il nodded, Lee Tae-Han finally opened his mouth.</p>
<p>“...What happened to Ms. Mary? Was the ritual successful?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, man. There is no news of anything yet. But don’t worry. Odin directly ordered this. If he didn’t have confidence, then he wouldn’t have entrusted such a task to Mary noona. She is Mary. Mary, the Bitch.”</p>
<p>Lee Tae-Han grimaced. “But I can’t help but worry, hyung.”</p>
<p>“...Well.”</p>
<p>Right when Seong-Il’s voice was fading, both Seong-Il and Lee Tae-Han’s eyes widened at the same time. Then, they turned their heads and rushed off in the same direction. It was toward the place where Mary noona usually used as a guest room!</p>
<p>When they got there, Osiris had also sensed the strong presence of Mary and arrived. Looking over Osiris’s shoulder at the sight that unfolded, Seong-Il felt more puzzled than happy.</p>
<p>Why are there Guides…</p>
<p>Dozens of Guides were flying around Mary noona.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 442</p>
<p>Mary noona didn’t appear to be severely injured, but she looked lethargic as she lay in bed and she didn’t even look at Seong-Il. Seong-Il turned his attention to the Guides, and they didn’t seem to pose a threat to Mary noona, at least for now.</p>
<p>In fact, it was actually the opposite. The swarms of radiant light emitted by the Guides as they fluttered around Mary noona appeared to seep into her body, bestowing a positive influence.</p>
<p>“Do not interrupt,” Seong-Il said to Osiris.</p>
<p>Whether it was because Osiris understood Korean or whether it was because arrived at the same conclusion, he turned around and brushed past Seong-Il.</p>
<p>“I will stay here and watch the situation, so hurry and take care of your business, bro.”</p>
<p>After saying this to Tae-Han, Seong-Il began to stand guard at the door like a gatekeeper.</p>
<p>Guides…those bastards… If they even slightly touch her…</p>
<p>A decent amount of time passed before Mary looked at Seong-Il. She gestured at him to come closer by flicking her fingers. The Guides responded to her action as well by flying away. They also reacted to Seong-Il’s movement. The speed at which they scattered was swift, perhaps because Seong-Il threw himself at Mary quickly.</p>
<p>It was a sight as if a blue sphere shattered and its fragments scattered everywhere.</p>
<p>Seong-Il wanted to ask Mary a lot, but he held back while keeping in mind to stay alert of the Guides.</p>
<p>“These children will not attack you, Seong-Il,” said Mary, but Seong-Il couldn’t shake off his uncomfortable feeling.</p>
<p>“Are you serious? No, they are not scary, but…you know… I don’t like the way they pranked us in the past.”</p>
<p>She smiled. “That is an old story.”</p>
<p>While it could have been a while to Mary noona as she could transcend the mental world, but the Stage of Advent was not a long time ago for him. It had been only a few months since he returned from there. Although many events did happen simultaneously after that, it didn’t change that fact.</p>
<p>The incidents that occurred since his return flashed through Seong-Il’s mind.</p>
<p>“Anyway, are you okay, noona?” he asked.</p>
<p>“As you can tell.”</p>
<p>He shook his head. “No, I mean, is your mind okay? The way you were daydreaming seemed like you were going through a hard time.”</p>
<p>Mary shrugged. “I am glad that I was only injured to this extent. Fighting against a Demon King is not easy.”</p>
<p>His eyes widened. “Are you sure you won?”</p>
<p>She bared her teeth. “I tore it apart, that piece of shit.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il didn’t miss the anger that momentarily appeared on Mary’s face. Her rage didn’t merely end there because there was a sudden flash in her weak smile. The murderous intent even fluttered between her furrowed brows and exposed teeth. The grudge was so deep that she was still pissed even though she had already killed it.</p>
<p>Seong-Il got goosebumps as it was more dreadful than what he felt from Osiris. He suddenly realized something and questioned, “Then… Did you also become the Demon King, noona?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am at the bottom of their hierarchy, but I am now the worshiped deity of the Lunea clan.” Mary smiled.</p>
<p>He blinked. “Lunea clan. Is that the real name of the Guides?”</p>
<p>Then, Seong-Il heard her telepathy.</p>
<p>- Seong-Il. Don’t tell this to anyone else, and please don’t get upset. Osiris’s turn is next, when Odin pulls down Doom Entegasto.</p>
<p>Seong-Il held his breath.</p>
<p>- I am planning to promote Osiris to that position. So, you know what to do now, right? You need to make a lot of money because you will definitely have to dedicate more money than you did this time. Expand the attack team.</p>
<p>Mary noona’s story didn’t end there. She continued explaining why Odin had been supporting Osiris lately.</p>
<p>The old Undead Emperor?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Seong-Il came out, scratching his nose, which was his habit whenever he felt embarrassed. His misunderstanding towards Osiris was resolved, but that was it. Nothing had changed about the fact that a lot of power was being concentrated in Osiris.</p>
<p>Seong-Il held no doubts about Osiris’s loyalty to Odin. The individuals surrounding him, both presently and in the past, were handpicked by Odin himself. However, Seong-Il had witnessed numerous instances where people with power changed somehow.</p>
<p>This applied to Lee Tae-Han as well. The message that Lee Tae-Han had sent to Osiris was not like how he was before. It had unveiled Tae-Han’s genuine thoughts, but for Tae-Han himself, it was merely an act driven by the greater cause.</p>
<p>This is why people should always maintain their composure. We should think twice or even three times to doubt the situation. If we become complacent, this is the outcome. Tsk tsk. So foolish. How is he going to face Osiris from now on? If I were him, I would avoid him forever since this is too embarrassing.</p>
<p>The sun was setting outside, and Seong-Il fed the Kciphos in response to Yeon-Hee’s request. Then, he decided that Seoul would be his next destination. On the way to Seoul in his private helicopter, he addressed the matters he couldn’t deal with for a while.</p>
<p>He checked on Ki-Cheol’s well-being and ensured that his parents didn’t have any problems. Only after confirming the welfare of his family did he make a call to the CEO of Iljoo CA.</p>
<p>&lt;Did you arrive, Mr. Seong-Il?&gt;</p>
<p>Oh, you are not calling me Caliber? Oh, well. I must still be a superstar in the mainland.</p>
<p>It seemed that his popularity extended beyond the mainland. Even in this realm, his popularity remained strong.</p>
<p>He didn’t make any effort to hide the smile that naturally appeared on his face. Since it was not a video call, he had to be only conscious of his laughter which sounded like an old man.</p>
<p>He used his large palm to cover the microphone of his phone and cleared his throat.</p>
<p>Ahem.</p>
<p>Then, he continued.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: It’s me. I am on my way to Seoul, and I will be there in one hour. Are you available to meet up?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Is there something going on?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Thanks for asking, hahaha. But, if something bad happens to me, that would directly link to the danger of hoo… no, no. Ahem. Humanity.&gt;</p>
<p>Ah, fuck me. Why did I slur at the end?</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Ahahahha- I will… I will call you when I get there.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Could you please tell me in advance what you would like to talk about? I will prepare the documents.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Umm… You know… Ahem.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Pardon me?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: The advertisement. I would like to shoot some commercials. The offers I got earlier…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Oh, I thought you rejected that a while ago. Or was there a miscommunication during the process?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: So, I can’t shoot them now? Hahaha.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Of course you can. But, Mr. Seong-Il. This is not my area to be involved in, but may I ask you the reason behind your desire to shoot them now?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Doing this can also help Iljoo CA earn money, right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Yes, you are right.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: So, let’s do the big ones instead of multiple small ones.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;But, I don’t consider you someone who fusses about commercials.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: I don’t want to rest forever. I should be more diligent and work harder…&gt;</p>
<p>Fuck, stumbling over words like this only ruins my impression. The Caliber is charming because I am dependable and warm. This girl must have been attracted to that, so I should keep this concept. Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Then, let’s narrow it down to the big ones. With that, we can raise some money and proceed with the proposal you suggested last time.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;You mean… the ‘corporate loan,’ right?&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: I don’t know much about borrowing and investing, whatever. But I want to put some money into the company and expand the size of the attack team. I also want to bring in those weaklings who played minor roles in the Stage of Advent under me, prepare some items for them, and buy plenty of Awakened elixirs…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Wait a moment. How much do you think you want to borrow? To handle all the things you just mentioned, it requires lots of money. Umm… Mr. Seong-Il. This is not about this, but umm…&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Go ahead.&gt;</p>
<p>&lt;Are you short on money? I know that you don’t spend much money for personal matters.&gt;</p>
<p>Seong-Il hesitated for a second before responding.</p>
<p>&lt;Seong-Il: Money comes and goes, right? What is important for a person is their abilities. That’s right. I am broke now, but I will recover soon. So, please just trust me and don’t worry about it.&gt;</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just a few weeks ago, such large gatherings of people were seen only during the protests against the Jeonil Group. However, those protests coincided with Jonathan Hunter’s voluntary court appearance and the targeted attack on him. As a result, only a small number of protestors remained.</p>
<p>“You are so handsome!”</p>
<p>“Marry me!”</p>
<p>The crowd that gathered around Seong-Il at the time reminded him of the protests back then.</p>
<p>“Is that the real Caliber?”</p>
<p>“Oh my gosh, it’s Caliber.”</p>
<p>“I never imagined to see him in person!”</p>
<p>“Hey, hey…”</p>
<p>Whispers filled the air, and there were just as many smartphones recording him as there were those whispering.</p>
<p>Seong-Il didn’t feel bad about it. He never paid attention to his age at the Stage of Advent as there was no aging there.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, subtle changes had begun in his biological rhythm recently. Looking back, time had flown by quickly as Ki-Cheol had already become a middle school student. He would get old without realizing it if he continued being stuck on the battlefields.</p>
<p>Although it had been several months since his return from the stage, it felt like mere days. Time flew by during wars. He didn’t know when Odin’s ongoing war would end, but there was one thing he was certain of. If that day came, then he wouldn’t be able to experience such moments again.</p>
<p>The enthusiasm the young people showed towards him was only because he hadn’t grown old yet. If he became old, then he would only receive gazes of awe. Most Awakened would prefer such a glance, but Seong-Il didn’t.</p>
<p>Moreover, Ki-Cheol was still a teenager, so he needed to live in this country. Until Ki-Cheol became an adult, it was right for him to maintain a friendly image.</p>
<p>Seong-Il smiled and looked around. Then, his eyes met the eyes of a young girl.</p>
<p>“Why are you sneakily filming?” he asked.</p>
<p>She was about Ki-Cheol’s age.</p>
<p>He then grinned. “Do you want to take a selfie with me, girl?”</p>
<p>The giggling sound actually came from the crowd.</p>
<p>“What is your name?”</p>
<p>“Si-Ha… Jeong Si-Ha…”</p>
<p>Seong-Il took the smartphone of the girl, who didn’t know what to do. Then, he posed with her.</p>
<p>Snap!</p>
<p>“You can post it on your social media.”</p>
<p>The girl couldn’t take her eyes off the picture. Before then, the crowd had kept a certain distance from Seong-Il, but after he looked around again with a friendly smile, hands with smartphones stretched out from all directions.</p>
<p>“Me too! Me too!”</p>
<p>“Please take a picture with me, Mr. Caliber! Please!”</p>
<p>Although there were many people, most of them were civilians. They were all slow and had no ability to attack him or defend themselves.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, there were multiple images overlaid there. In particular, the image of Act Two Stage Five, when he was surrounded by ghouls, was vivid. Seong-Il stared at the slow-moving hand of a ghoul flying toward him. The ghoul’s rotten nails were right in front of him.</p>
<p>He faced it and said with a smile, “Oh my, I am not even that great, y’all. Don’t make too much noise. Selfie?”</p>
<p>Then, the ghouls answered with their lips dripping with pus.</p>
<p>“Yes, yes! Can I post it on Facenote?”</p>
<p>By the time Seong-Il’s eyes naturally blinked, the overlaid image had disappeared. A young male student was looking up at Seong-Il.</p>
<p>“It’s up to you. That’s why I took it.”</p>
<p>Seong-Il thought while looking down at the boy.</p>
<p>What a peaceful world.</p>
<p>These students’ expressions had not changed at all even after experiencing the Day of Advent.</p>
<p>If a problem arises on our side, I am here. I, Caliber, will definitely uphold the order that Odin has created. Even if I don’t have the power like Mary noona and Osiris…</p>
<p>Then, a high-pitched voice popped out from the crowd.</p>
<p>“Mr. Seong-Il, I told you. You are going to be late for shooting! At this speed, we will have trouble making it on time. Should I cancel it?”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s an advertisement for the King of Hell’s investment group. I should do my best. Let’s go. I will just take one more selfie and go.”</p>
<p>...</p>
