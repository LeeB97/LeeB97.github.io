<p>Chapter 145 - The Alternative (3)</p>
<p>The Northeast Nobles’ Alliance was on the brink. They wanted to accept this favor, but they had their own doubts.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is concealing his true intentions with some plausible words. He won’t stand by since this concerns the northeast? Nonsense! If Count Douglas and the alliance clash, Dmitry will benefit. Thus, there is no need to intervene and stop it from happening.’</p>
<p>It made sense to be suspicious. If there hadn’t been a fight between them, then maybe they wouldn’t respond like this. They wanted to figure out Roman’s intentions. But they couldn’t make a hasty move because if they came out strong, they could possibly lose their only chance to win.</p>
<p>‘Now isn’t the time to choose between fire or water.’</p>
<p>Viscount Conrad swallowed his doubts and felt that this was his last hope. He said,</p>
<p>“…the alliance and Dmitry haven’t been on good terms recently. Actually, this would be a good thing for Dmitry. When there was a conflict, we, the alliance, took Barco’s side, and our resentment grew over time. I will not deny that our relationship with Dmitry continued to decline, especially with the recent issue. But we need help now. Even if it is truly disrespectful to request this, I am willing to do anything if you promise to help us, so please tell us what we should do from now on.”</p>
<p>All complex thoughts were abandoned, and only a simple thought remained. If they went to war with Count Douglas, they wouldn’t be able to handle it. If that were the case, it would be better to gain favor with the Dmitry family and promote a future relationship.</p>
<p>‘Maybe his sincerity in this matter isn’t even important. If we can hold hands and minimize the damage in this war, if we can just do that, even if it means being attacked by Dmitry later, we can afford it. Now isn’t the time to stick to our pride.’</p>
<p>The profit and loss were calculated. Rather than shouting loudly, bowing their heads would accomplish more things.</p>
<p>How would Roman Dmitry respond? Because Roman is young, he might feel like he won this and maybe show mercy too.</p>
<p>But Roman’s answer was different from what they expected.</p>
<p>[If you acknowledge our relationship, I will be honest with you. For Dmitry, not helping your alliance will be a huge gain. But I am not going to miss the bigger picture just for a small win. Given how war is raging on all sides of Cairo, I am confident Viscount Conrad recognizes the need for us—Dmitry and the northeastern region—to cooperate together. The fact is that the northeast will shine most when we work together.]</p>
<p>Roman was being truthful. Viscount Conrad expected some kind of ridicule, so this was unexpected.</p>
<p>[We know that this choice wouldn’t leave us at an advantage. Even so, the forces of the north will attack the northeast, and we cannot stand by. No matter what happened in the past, aren’t we living in the same northeastern area? If the forces inside the same area decide to stand back because they are hostile to one another, the northeast is bound to fall into the path of destruction. My words are clear. Rather than expecting a reward from you, I expect sincere repentance for what you have done and your willingness to work together in the future. If you can promise that, I will forget the awful things that happened between us in the past and will not ignore the crisis that we are facing in our area.]</p>
<p>At that moment, Viscount Conrad felt something change inside of him. If the opponent showed a calculating attitude, he wouldn’t have cared about using him without any regret.</p>
<p>But this was kindness, and this made things complicated. Dmitry, of all the nobles, was reaching out to the Northeast Alliance, which was driven to its brink.</p>
<p>‘… what am I to make of this?’</p>
<p>His mouth wouldn’t move as his prejudiced gaze vanished. Dmitry, whom he hated for being a commoner, now seemed like a great leader who could lead this region.</p>
<p>It was funny. He realized Dmitry’s value only when he needed help.</p>
<p>‘Certainly. Dmitry has the qualities of a good leader who can lead the region.’</p>
<p>In just one conversation, all the ill feelings faded away.</p>
<p>Was that why?</p>
<p>“I will contact you again after discussing it with everyone here.”</p>
<p>Even though Viscount Conrad thought he should take the offer, he decided to step back with a serious face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The communication was cut off. Viscount responded by saying that he had to discuss it with the others. It seemed that he felt the sincerity in his own way, but to Roman, their sincerity wasn’t important.</p>
<p>‘The alliance has no choice but to accept my proposal. They will think nothing wrong will come from accepting it, but the moment Dmitry starts to help them, they will lose their grip on the land.’</p>
<p>The Northeast Nobles’ Alliance. They were like bats. They weren’t just cowards. They were the kind who needed help from those around them to survive.</p>
<p>And for them, a new path opened up. Dmitry seemed to accept them just because they were from the same region.</p>
<p>‘The northeast is a necessary evil. If one cannot accept the sincerity of everyone in the world, then filter out the forces of strife by ignoring existences like the Northeast Alliance. It isn’t like they will all fight together. They are now facing someone who is showing them kindness, so there will be pure goodwill toward Dmitry’s people because of this. They will have a division of opinion, and they will be unable to act out. The roots they held on this land will be lost. Even though they aren’t actually losing money, the thing they lose here is power, and they won’t even realize it.’</p>
<p>It was Baek Joong-hyuk. Heavenly Demon Baek Joon-hyuk. He didn’t always accept loyal people. Among the servants and subordinates who followed him, there were selfish people who cared for themselves, and there were people who formed a group to protect themselves. And Baek Joong-hyuk embraced all of these diverse humans under him.</p>
<p>As he led tens of thousands of people, he understood that each of them was different and controlled them perfectly. He opened their ears and made them forget about everything else. And with its overwhelming force and rule, the Demonic sect remained as ruler until he died.</p>
<p>‘The moment they will accept just one favor, Dmitry can devour the entire northeast without much effort.’</p>
<p>Roman was greedy. He wanted all of the northeast. At that point, he was confident that Dmitry would survive any future conflicts with the Central Government.</p>
<p>‘In order for Dmitry to attack, we must go through the forces in the northeast first. It may not be a huge problem for the Central Government when Dmitry has yet to win the public’s favor, but that is the present. The moment we devour the northeast, they will have to overcome many walls until they reach Dmitry. We can move the battlefield out of Dmitry, and the more we help people against the Central Government, the stronger the unity in the northeast will be. Then the forces tied to the northeast aren’t allowed the option of betraying Dmitry.’</p>
<p>He saw the future. The plan that began with the farmers being mistreated was perfect. That was why sincerity wasn’t important. It is good if people are loyal, but even if they aren’t, that won’t change much for Roman. Just one surrender was all he needed.</p>
<p><em>Kik!</em></p>
<p>He laid back on the chair and waited. The alliance should send a message soon. Then he could finally reap the benefits.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later.</p>
<p>The day was bright. Count Douglas really did bring in his troops. The lords of the north were also present.</p>
<p>A northern noble said,</p>
<p>“Sir Douglas. If we destroy the northeastern nobles, we have to make a clear plan.”</p>
<p>“Of course. Why would I keep it all for myself? This is a golden chance for all of us. Since the fall of Barco, the northeast has lost all its power and its leader. Now, it is just a sandcastle waiting to collapse. Shouldn’t someone be taking possession of such things?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. Just hearing that makes me feel good.”</p>
<p>The nobles of the north. They didn’t add more troops because of their relationship. Count Douglas offered an advantage, and that was the division of the spoils once they won.</p>
<p>‘People think of me as a mindless beast, but I don’t blindly attack people. If I go on a fight, I will fight by increasing my odds as much as possible to survive.’</p>
<p>He was wicked to the core. He would always link his pride to practical gains.</p>
<p>The Northeast had an amazing mountain range. He expressed his anger, but when he thought more about it, there wouldn’t be a chance like this again. Starting from the northeast, it seemed that if he did well, he could take over the surrounding regions as well.</p>
<p>‘Morons. When Barco was protected by the Central Government, I couldn’t make a move, but things are different now. The alliance itself is in despair. Since the power of the northeast is not strong, it will not be too difficult to bring them down.’</p>
<p>His blood boiled. He had already set the stage for killing. He hurried and took his steps excitedly when he noticed the troops of the alliance.</p>
<p>The wars of nobles are always in order. Barco and Lawrence, who had a siege, were special cases. Nobles usually go to war after deciding when and where to fight.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t so different now. By expressing to the Central Government his intention of going to war, they gave the alliance a choice and declared that they preferred the war to be in the plains.</p>
<p>Finally, they arrived on the scene.</p>
<p>Count Douglas, who was on top of his horse leading the troops, said,</p>
<p>“I am Count Douglas, the commander of the north! Opponent, answer me!”</p>
<p>At those words, Viscount Conrad stepped forward. Unlike Count Douglas, who seemed ready to order an attack at any time, Viscount Conrad seemed slightly concerned.</p>
<p>“It’s not yet time, so please wait a moment.”</p>
<p>“It seems like everyone has arrived, so why should we wait? Or perhaps surrendering right now would be better. After all, there is no reason to fight a losing battle.”</p>
<p>Arrogant words. Count Douglas was already convinced of his victory, and the lords of the north were the same.</p>
<p>But Viscount Conrad didn’t lose his calm. Despite the provocations, he responded calmly without changing his expression.</p>
<p>“You need to deal with the small and large things. When the time comes, I have no intention of avoiding the fight either.”</p>
<p>After saying that, he stepped back.</p>
<p>Was it because the reaction was different from what he expected? Count Douglas looked a bit angry.</p>
<p>‘Arrogant bastards.’</p>
<p>That made him realize that he could never forgive them. He vowed to stomp on them after their victory. Then he went back to his troops.</p>
<p>How long was it? The lords of the north were calmly talking when they saw a group of men coming from afar.</p>
<p>“Someone is coming.”</p>
<p>“Did the northeast call for reinforcements?”</p>
<p>They were calm at first, but then…</p>
<p>…the moment they checked the flag, their faces went stiff.</p>
<p>“… Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>This was something that shouldn’t have happened.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They were confident that Dmitry wouldn’t intervene in this war. They had recently fought, so the northern nobles were certain he would not aid the northeast.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was leading the troops of Dmitry.</p>
<p>And when he arrived, Count Douglas asked in a loud voice,</p>
<p>“… what is Dmitry doing here?”</p>
<p>“Should there be a special reason for appearing on the battlefield? Just as Count Douglas summoned the lords of the north, I came here for the northeast.”</p>
<p>He gave a clear answer.</p>
<p>At this moment, Count Douglas and the Northeast Alliance were in a war. When Count Douglas requested the lords of the north to ensure victory, this also gave Dmitry a justification to participate in the war.</p>
<p>If he only knew that Dmitry would join, he wouldn’t have even given him a justification for participating in the war, even if he overdid it.</p>
<p>‘This.’</p>
<p>He looked shocked.</p>
<p>The lords of the north looked at each other, and it was then…</p>
<p>“We are ready.”</p>
<p>Viscount Conrad said.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days ago, at the end of their meeting, the northeast came to a conclusion.</p>
<p>“We don’t have a reason to refuse your offer. If you help us defeat Douglas, wouldn’t that be an advantage for both sides? At the very least, I think accepting Dmitry as our ally is a better choice than having the North trample on us.”</p>
<p>Finally, they held hands with Roman. They decided that this was to their advantage, so they all displayed genuine emotion in response to Dmitry’s words. And for whatever reason, the fact that Dmitry accepted them as people of the same region made them look at Dmitry with new eyes.</p>
<p>And now, Viscount Conrad stood behind Roman. Seeing his figure hiding behind a powerful guardian, Roman spoke,</p>
<p>“You get to choose now. Hand-to-hand combat or a battle of great warriors. Which one do you want?”</p>
<p>For Roman Dmitry, it was the beginning of his journey to establish himself as the ruler of the northeast.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 146 - The Alternative (4)</p>
<p>Count Douglas was flustered by the sudden turn of events. Not only did Roman Dmitry intervene in the war, but he immediately asked him to make a choice.</p>
<p>‘Damn it. Dmitry is joining the war.’</p>
<p>It felt like his blood was running cold. Due to Dmitry’s participation in the war, the victory of the north could no longer be guaranteed.</p>
<p>‘Now that it has been declared, this situation cannot be undone. Then, as Roman Dmitry said, we must choose between the two options. Which of the two choices benefits the north?’</p>
<p>A battle of great warriors? Never. In the war with Hector, Roman Dmitry defeated Butler, and had risen to the continent’s ranks.</p>
<p>Actually, in the Cairo Kingdom, except for the Royal Knights’ Captain, no monster could rival this man.</p>
<p>Count Douglas, who recently heard rumors of Roman holding a tournament, sent six of his men, and not a single one of them lost.</p>
<p>Three fights. In a situation where Roman’s victory was certain, the odds couldn’t be guaranteed even after two battles with Roman.</p>
<p>In particular, the existence of Chris, who was famous like Roman, made it impossible to win a battle between great warriors.</p>
<p>‘It is an unconditional defeat. We brought so many troops, yet we will end up being losers. The problem is that I cannot choose hand-to-hand combat either. The north’s forces will be enough to overwhelm the alliance of the northeast, but Roman Dmitry’s participation changes everything.’</p>
<p>After the war with Hector, rumors from the capital went around the Cairo Kingdom. Roman Dmitry slaughtered hundreds of enemies all alone when they were isolated in the south and opened the gates after taking back the fortress.</p>
<p>This wasn’t something a normal human could do. And even if the war rumors were just exaggerations, Count Douglas believed that there had to be truth in them.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. The hero of the Southern Front was Roman Dmitry. Going against such a monster in hand-to-hand combat didn’t sit well.</p>
<p>‘What am I supposed to do now?’</p>
<p>The Northern Beast couldn’t move forward or step back. Even as a man with a fearsome nature, Roman Dmitry’s fame made him hesitate.</p>
<p>He was in a difficult situation. The situation turned into a mess just because of the participation of one family—the Dmitry family.</p>
<p>The other lords of the north weren’t much different. Normally, they would have been the first to encourage him to move forward, but now they only waited for Count Douglas to decide. With all the talk about Roman Dmitry in the Cairo Kingdom, they didn’t want to fall prey to heroic stories.</p>
<p>An awkward silence lingered.</p>
<p>Right then…</p>
<p>“May I make a suggestion?”</p>
<p>Roman broke the silence.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman knew the troubles of other people. They could walk back in defeat if they offered a compromise to save face.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>‘I don’t want that.’</p>
<p>The Douglas family and the lords of the north were such good prey. They were like barbarians threatening the Northeast Alliance, and he would be the one to defeat them.</p>
<p>In this case, the northeast took Dmitry’s hand. Perhaps, rather than swearing allegiance, it was right to say that they compromised with an enemy and talked in order to resolve their immediate threat.</p>
<p>Then, what steps were needed to end the final stage of the plan? In an instant, the Northeast Alliance had come under Dmitry’s protection, and Roman needed to show them how comfortable life would be if they held hands with Dmitry.</p>
<p>Going against the Northeast Nobles’ Alliance, the Douglas family came. The moment they couldn’t hold back their anger and set foot in the northeast, they got caught in the trap.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“The proposal is simple. Let’s have a battle of great warriors, but I will deal with three warriors at the same time.”</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone looked shocked. They would admit that Roman was strong, but they didn’t expect such a foolish proposal to be made.</p>
<p>“It is something hard to refuse, child.”</p>
<p>He dug the trap. It was a very tempting offer. Rather than just hand-to-hand combat and a battle of great warriors, a three-on-one battle felt like a disadvantage, favoring the side with more numbers.</p>
<p>And Count Douglas had twin swordsmen who were well-known under him. The older one was a 3-star, and the younger one was a 2-star. Their skills were recognized as they went around defeating many strong swordsmen.</p>
<p>But Roman knew that, and he had intentionally laid out such a proposal. He deliberately laid out this plan so that the opponent would think they had the upper hand, and he waited for their answer.</p>
<p>Count Douglas, the man whose temper never calmed down. How could someone who has lived with anger and is even angrier now want to be given an advantage? But the fact that Roman defeated Butler was what scared him.</p>
<p>And to him…</p>
<p>“If you are that worried, then you can increase the number of warriors to five. I want this war to have a clean end.”</p>
<p>Roman said.</p>
<p>He purposefully spoke arrogantly in order to enrage Count Douglas.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Douglas took a while. He walked away from the lords of the north, went to the northeast nobles and declared with an expression not hiding his anger,</p>
<p>“I will accept it.”</p>
<p>What were Roman’s intentions?</p>
<p>Roman knew that provoking Count Douglas would make him accept the battle of great warriors.</p>
<p>He tried to suppress his emotions and make a rational decision, but the moment he said five against one….</p>
<p>“I know that Roman Dmitry is strong. He defeated Homer and even defeated Butler, so his strength has been proven. But it is five people. And, no matter how strong he is, there is a limit to how many people he can handle with only two legs and arms. If I send out talented people from families, couldn’t one of them beat Roman?”</p>
<p>“… still, it is tough. The fact that he defeated Butler means there is a chance that Roman is a 5-star.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I don’t know that? Doesn’t this mean the other way too? No matter which of the two options he gave us, we have to deal with that monster. So, I think the only way to increase our odds of winning, even by a small margin, is to choose the most advantageous situation. And this is something that I didn’t reveal to the public, but I have twin swordsmen under me who once defeated a 4-star swordsman. And although their opponent had just reached 4-stars at that time, it also means that they were perfect.”</p>
<p>“Is that true?”</p>
<p>Everyone asked. Swordsmen who defeated a 4-star swordsman? If that was true, then maybe they had a chance.</p>
<p>Count Douglas said.</p>
<p>“I will have my twin swordsmen participate in the battle. If what I said isn’t true, there would be no reason for me to jump into this. Just three more men have to agree with me on this. Roman Dmitry has to be as strong as the rumors say, but he is still a man in his mid-20s. And as he gained fame and power, it surely made his young blood boil with excitement. That’s why he made a risky decision to show off his strength now, even if the situation is disadvantageous to him. This is our chance. When he is still arrogant and running around like this, we can cut off his breath and devour the northeast.”</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were red. Whether their opinion was right or wrong, it didn’t matter. Roman crossed the line, and Count Douglas thought he wouldn’t have a day of peace unless he fought back now.</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“I will follow the words of the Count.”</p>
<p>“Like the Count, I think Roman Dmitry made a mistake. I admit that he is strong, but it is arrogant to ask us to deal with five people at once.”</p>
<p>They gathered their opinions, and the nobles made the decision. They were sure that they could crush Roman Dmitry’s arrogance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A noble from the Central Government came to observe. The rules were simple. Count Douglas and the lords of the north would send out five swordsmen, and Roman said he would deal with them alone.</p>
<p>“Phew.”</p>
<p>“Do not be nervous. After all, the other person is also a human like us.”</p>
<p>The five swordsmen representing the north stepped forward. Roman was already waiting for them, and the moment he looked into their eyes, they became nervous.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. The man with a great name. To the swordsmen in the Cairo Kingdom, he was like a new legend, so the fact that they were dealing with him terrified them.</p>
<p>And they believed they had a chance of winning. Before the confrontation, Benton, the oldest of the twins, told them about a plan to ensure their victory.</p>
<p>Benton said,</p>
<p>“Everyone take my word for this. The moment the fight starts, Bentel and I will move from both sides and aim for Roman Dmitry’s blind spot. Left and right. Attacks that come from both sides will force Roman to use both hands to defend. And the pincer attack starts by cutting down his flow. While we are drawing his attention, if you attack Roman from different directions, he will be pushed back without a chance to counterattack.”</p>
<p>“From then on, it is our fight. If the opponent tries to attack, you attack the opponent’s possible gap in his defense and make it impossible for him to land an attack. We have many on our side, so if we can do our best, then one of us can win.”</p>
<p>Bentel, the younger one, continued.</p>
<p>The twin swordsmen. Because of the lead they had taken so far, the other swordsmen trusted them.</p>
<p>“Let’s go.”</p>
<p>Finally, the time came, and when they faced their opponent, the twins raised their mana.</p>
<p>‘This fight is in our favor.’</p>
<p>‘You made an arrogant choice, man. If we win here, we gain the new name of defeating Roman Dmitry.’</p>
<p>It was a golden chance. They were confident enough to defeat even a monster with a clear plan. Their mouths were dry as they held their swords and waited for the signal to start the fight.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p><em>Flutter.</em></p>
<p>The flag was dropped.</p>
<p>Benton and Bentel moved by kicking the ground for a push.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded.</p>
<p>There was an explosive power from the push of their legs, and as planned, they moved for Roman’s blind spot.</p>
<p>They were neither fast nor slow.</p>
<p>The two attacked Roman almost simultaneously, and the three other swordsmen who rushed after them also thought of attacking if the timing worked out.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Blood splashed, and no one saw what happened.</p>
<p>The two swordsmen who ran at the same time were both bleeding.</p>
<p>Their chests were ripped open, and they fell to the ground in shock.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>That was it.</p>
<p>They took their final breaths.</p>
<p>It was such an embarrassing situation, and the swordsmen who rushed in late stopped walking.</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>“He killed the twin swordsmen in one hit!”</p>
<p>It was embarrassing.</p>
<p>The results were right ahead. The other swordsman gulped down.</p>
<p>Looking around him, Roman said,</p>
<p>“When I heard that Count Douglas declared war, a thought flashed through my mind. What was he thinking when he decided to come here to the northeast? When Barco was alive, people always tried to solve problems with the northeast through simple dialogues. Why didn’t problems get solved with words now?”</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>Drops of blood continued to drip from his sword.</p>
<p>In this open land, Roman’s voice resounded.</p>
<p>“In the end, it is a simple matter. They didn’t even care that the Dmitry family was here. If not, there would be no reason for the lords of the north, including Count Douglas, to come and make this choice. And that fact, to me, is very irritating.”</p>
<p>His eyes were looking around.</p>
<p>And he stopped at one person.</p>
<p>It was Count Douglas.</p>
<p>Looking at his shocked face, Roman said in a calm voice,</p>
<p>“Even now, I will give you a chance to end the battle of great warriors. It seems that the war ended too blandly to be called a war that is being observed even by people from the Central Government. So what do we do now?”</p>
<p>Said Roman.</p>
<p>Contrary to his tone, his remarks made Count Douglas widen his eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 147 - The Alternative (5)</p>
<p>The title ‘Northern Beast’ came from one incident. He had a conflict with the nobles around him, and when they were arguing for a cause, he didn’t think twice and challenged his opponents to a duel and cut off their heads at once. And the people who witnessed them bleeding to death could not keep their mouths shut.</p>
<p>From that point on, rumors circulated that Count Douglas was fiery, and for him, it was a good title. Even if he frowned a little or showed signs of irritation, the other party would immediately back down.</p>
<p>And as time passed, Count Douglas enjoyed a lot of things with the title he was given. He was a true warrior and he had armed troops, so he had no problem living in the northern part of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And this case wasn’t different.</p>
<p>The Northeast Alliance. As the Central Government’s protection disappeared due to Barco’s downfall, he no longer had to suppress his desires.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s presence wasn’t a concern. He had no issues with them at all. He believed there was no chance of Dmitry intervening if the Northeast Alliance was attacked. It was a perfect plan, as usual.</p>
<p>And he thought he could just act angry, and the other person would tremble and plead with him.</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>Blood was dripping on the ground. The twin swordsmen of the Douglas family no longer moved as the blood continued to flow.</p>
<p>His head began to spin at this. He was sure they could take down Roman Dmitry, seeing how they rushed in, but what came next was shocking.</p>
<p>Just a single hit. They were unable to block one attack, and the twins died. Knowing just how bothersome things were, Count Douglas was confident the twins would win, only to be shocked by the result.</p>
<p>‘Is this what it means to be a ranker of the continent?’</p>
<p>This was out of this world.</p>
<p>He looked up.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was someone he couldn’t dare touch.</p>
<p>“Even now, I will give you a chance to end the battle of great warriors. It seems that the war ended too blandly to be called a war that is being observed even by people from the Central Government. So what do we do now?”</p>
<p>Roman’s words and the absurd proposal. Even after winning the battle, this man didn’t stop attacking him.</p>
<p>He got goosebumps. Not only did this prove his confidence, but he was also punishing the lords of the north who crossed into the northeast.</p>
<p>How strong was the Dmitry family? He ignored the inevitable reality and thought he could beat this man.</p>
<p>Count Douglas should have turned red and yelled in rage based on his reputation, but instead, meeting this strong person right here, he averted his gaze.</p>
<p>‘… many soldiers would have died in combat. Rather than that, losing just five here is better.’</p>
<p>He ignored the corpses in front and the three trembling swordsmen. They looked at him, hoping he would help them out, but Count Douglas didn’t even make eye contact.</p>
<p>“Rules are rules. Since we decided to fight in this way, we’ll keep going until the end.”</p>
<p><em>Smile.</em></p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>The people who were there didn’t understand what Douglas truly meant. Even if he pushed them to fight, this was like raising a white flag, and that meant their ‘rank’ too.</p>
<p>The Dmitry family pressured the north.</p>
<p>Roman withdrew his gaze and looked at the terrified men.</p>
<p>“If you put it that way. We will proceed with the battle of great warriors as planned.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a death sentence, and two men had already died. The remaining swordsmen representing the north were unable to hold back their fear of death.</p>
<p>“Do we really have to do this?”</p>
<p>“The fight has ended. How about we end this like this?”</p>
<p>They put up a white flag. Surrendering without even clashing with swords was a disgrace equal to lowering the honor of the North.</p>
<p>Yet the lords of the north couldn’t blame them. They could understand how the warriors felt because the corpses lying in front of them showed how big the difference was.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“From the moment both sides put their lives at risk, no one knows what will happen until the end. One of us has to bleed. Naturally, the result will be brutal. And if you don’t want to fight, then you can finish it by saying you quit and raising the white flag like cowards. But if you don’t like what I said just now, then come.”</p>
<p><em>Tik.</em></p>
<p>His sword touched the ground. And the sound of his sword clanking against the ground made the swordsmen shake.</p>
<p>“From now on, I will not be using a sword. Even against me like this, if you don’t fight because of fear, then I will let you go back to your pathetic lives like a dog crawling in fear. Choose. Will you risk your life for an honorable victory, or will you throw away your pride as a swordsman and live a disgusting life?”</p>
<p>At that moment, those watching felt scared. After Roman made the suggestion of continuing the fight, he said he wouldn’t use a sword. His words made no sense to many. They would acknowledge that Roman Dmitry was strong, but he was being arrogant.</p>
<p>‘There is hope. Only when I do this will the existence of Dmitry gets known.’</p>
<p>‘An alternative choice.’</p>
<p>This wasn’t just a message for the North. He wanted to show the reality to both the northeast and the north. How the existence of the Dmitry family is going to change in the future is being projected through the war now.</p>
<p>“… what do we do?”</p>
<p>“Fuck, as if I know.’</p>
<p>The northern swordsmen looked at each other.</p>
<p>Roman is strong, but hearing his words, ‘crawl like a dog in fear and not use a sword,’ their senses were shaken. Roman is surely an overwhelmingly strong being, but they didn’t want to step back from this like cowards. After all, a swordsman without a sword is a good target.</p>
<p>“This decides it all.”</p>
<p>“Do not regret what you just said.”</p>
<p>Finally, they decided to do it. Knowing that they could not handle what would happen if they backed out, they chose to fight for their lives.</p>
<p>Then everyone looked at the Central Government noble who came to observe. As he nodded, the northern swordsmen rushed forward.</p>
<p>“Kill him!”</p>
<p><em>Tatatat!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>They had no plan. They just knew that the opponent didn’t hold a sword. Since there was no way to stop them, no matter how they attacked, they all chose to attack Roman at the same time.</p>
<p>People who were watching this gulped upon seeing their auras rise. Their eyes told them that Roman’s situation was bad, but Roman’s confident face made it hard to be shocked.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He reached right out to all three of them in front of him.</p>
<p>They attacked from different sides. Their swords with auras attacked his head, torso, and legs at the same time, showing their determination to kill him.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>Roman’s hair fluttered.</p>
<p>He made a surprising move. He sidestepped to avoid the attack on his legs, and the sword passed next to his torso, and he caught the sword that was aimed at his head with his hand.</p>
<p>A sword with an aura was caught with just a hand. His hand should have been ripped apart, but he had no problem holding onto the blade with a thin aura.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p><em>Crack.</em></p>
<p>The sword broke, and the swordsman’s heart sank the moment his shocked eyes turned to Roman.</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>His face was crushed.</p>
<p>The swordsman who was aiming for his head fell down like a doll with its thread broken, and Roman used his leg to crush the lower body of the swordsman aiming for his legs.</p>
<p>They should have been able to protect their bodies with auras. But their fragile human bodies shattered, and two people lost their lives in an instant.</p>
<p>And the last person remaining…</p>
<p>He hurriedly stepped back, trying to say he surrendered.</p>
<p>“I have no ill feelings towards you. However, where you are standing now is what matters.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>Roman grabbed his hair, dragged him by his head, and punched him in the face.</p>
<p><em>Crack.</em></p>
<p>There was a sound of a face being crushed. When he let go, thick blood dripped down the man’s head like water, and his body fell to the ground.</p>
<p>The battle ended, but no one cheered. People were too dumbfounded at what they saw, unable to accept it.</p>
<p>Roman looked at Count Douglas.</p>
<p>“I will finish this work here. Do you have any objections?”</p>
<p>Hearing his words, Count Douglas only shook his head with a pale face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The case was closed. Count Douglas admitted defeat and took a step toward this new reality that he didn’t expect.</p>
<p>The result was good. The Northeast Alliance should be celebrating their victory, but no one could hide their white faces.</p>
<p>“Uh.”</p>
<p>Viscount Conrad groaned, and his heart raced wildly as he saw Roman approaching him.</p>
<p>“Uh, uh.”</p>
<p>His hands and feet trembled in fear.</p>
<p>The problem with Count Douglas. The northeast was certain of their outcome when they chose to seek the assistance of the Dmitry family. It was a sure win. They believed it was possible to defeat the enemy with power.</p>
<p>But this was way too overwhelming. His hiccups wouldn’t stop when he thought of how Roman’s sword, which killed the swordsmen of the north, was going to attack him as well.</p>
<p>“Huh, hic—”</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is a monster. Defeating Hector wasn’t some fluke, but it was a possible result because this monster was there on the Southern Front. If we had chosen to go to an all-out war with Dmitry, just like those men, we would have been slaughtered.’</p>
<p>This was not a theory but a fact.</p>
<p>They couldn’t handle the lords of the north, so they had to bring in Dmitry, but this man was more dangerous.</p>
<p>The other nobles of the northeast weren’t much different from Viscount Conrad. They couldn’t even look into Roman’s eyes, and they tried not to show their trembling bodies.</p>
<p>Dmitry and the northeast. Even though they hadn’t gone into an all-out war, this felt like an indirect war of nerves.</p>
<p>And now…</p>
<p>“… you worked really hard for us.”</p>
<p>Viscount Conrad bowed his head. Seeing his quick response, the other nobles rushed and bowed to Roman as well.</p>
<p>The northeast. This was the moment when the ranking in their area was clearly organized.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, Roman summoned the nobles of the northeast. In the past, most would have expressed their intention not to attend, but they flocked over immediately.</p>
<p>“Viscount Conrad has arrived!”</p>
<p>“Baron Rollow has arrived!”</p>
<p>The Northeast Alliance came running. People who used to sneer at Dmitry’s words when Barco was still alive now act like scared children.</p>
<p>It was quite an unbelievable sight. Jonathan, the Knights’ commander in charge of the castle, was particularly taken aback by the nobles’ shift in attitude.</p>
<p>‘The nobles of the northeast came to attend? Is something changing?’</p>
<p>He was sure that the nobles in the northeast area were not polite to Dmitry. And knowing that all of these changes were brought about by Roman Dmitry’s accomplishment, the commander’s heart beat loudly.</p>
<p>When he came to Dmitry, he had no regrets about choosing to be loyal to Baron Romero, and no swordsman would not wish to live the same life as him.</p>
<p>He stood tall. He raised his voice and greeted the nobles with a proud face.</p>
<p>The sun wasn’t even in the middle of the sky, but all the nobles had already gathered. The spacious room was filled with nobles, and the nobles’ reactions were divided.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, that happened?”</p>
<p>“Next time, please invite me too. Shouldn’t joy be shared?”</p>
<p>The nobles who followed Dmitry were friendly, and they could smile and talk with one another.</p>
<p>On the other hand…</p>
<p>“…”</p>
<p>Viscount Conrad and the northeastern nobles were silent, like criminals caught in the act. They looked around with nervous faces, but they tried to keep their heads up.</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p>“Young Master Roman Dmitry enters.”</p>
<p>Everyone stopped, even the pro-Dmitry. All of them stopped talking and bowed to Roman.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry, a being who raised Dmitry’s status and who could no longer be treated as a simple young master.</p>
<p><em>Kik.</em></p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman took a step and sat on the highest chair.</p>
<p>“For this meeting. I was given full authority by my father. Is there anyone who doesn’t like this?”</p>
<p>Nobody dared to open their mouths. All the nobles acknowledged Roman’s existence.</p>
<p>“Then, from now on, I will be talking about the new changes in the northeast area.”</p>
<p>As if a new king sat on the throne.</p>
<p>From now on, he was going to introduce a new rule.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 148 - The Alternative (6)</p>
<p>Roman asked.</p>
<p>“Do you think the Cairo Kingdom is moving in the right direction?”</p>
<p>The first topic was a sensitive one. The nobles’ faces stiffened at this, but Roman didn’t care.</p>
<p>“I was on the Southern Front during the invasion of the Hector Kingdom. What made it difficult for me at that time wasn’t the Hector Kingdom but the enemy on the inside. Immediately after the war broke out, I noticed the enemy’s intention to capture the warp gate. However, the captains in the Southern Front didn’t listen to me, and in just a few days, the Front fell into the hands of the Hector Kingdom.”</p>
<p>It was a disaster. Their careless attitude caused chaos, and a large area was lost instantly. The reality of a small nation couldn’t be put into words. The Hector Kingdom was no different than the Cairo Kingdom, but in times of crisis, Hector was at least united.</p>
<p>“And that alone wasn’t the problem. When the royal family learned of the attack, they didn’t act immediately. The leaders of the nation were torn into four factions and had to take a lot of time to make up their minds before sending troops, and during that time, the Southern Front had a very difficult time. The same happened afterward. Did they send troops from the royal family? No. They even minimized the troops of the Central Government nobles and sent people around the South. If my soldiers and I failed to turn the tide, maybe even now, the kingdom would be at war with Hector.”</p>
<p>“… what do you mean by all of this?”</p>
<p>A noble asked.</p>
<p>Roman’s words were against the royal family. He was hearing words he had never even thought about.</p>
<p>“I am not speaking of rebellion, but we must face reality.”</p>
<p>Rebellion. It was something the nobles were worried about, and as Roman denied it, they asked him,</p>
<p>“Then please tell us the main point.”</p>
<p>“The Cairo Kingdom is being controlled by the Central Government. This case alone proved that the royal family could not move its troops without the permission of the Central Government. And even when the Southern Front was in danger, the troops of the South were the main force, and the Central Government conserved its own men. What do you think this means? What if Cairo is at war? Then the Central Government will mobilize troops from the northeast. And they will surely go to war for the sake of the good fortune of the nation, but will they put their own men in harm’s way or take advantage of the local troops, even if it is a sure victory? The nobles of these estates will lose their troops, whereas the nobles of the capital will retain their power.”</p>
<p>The royal family was unstable. The others had no plans to overthrow the royal family or claim the throne, but they did require a force to oppose Cairo’s power.</p>
<p>“The reality of the Cairo Kingdom is horrible. We live in the same nation and pay the same taxes, so why do the nobles of the Central Government and us have different priorities? How long are we just going to watch this reality? After experiencing this, I decided to make a new change in the northeast.”</p>
<p>Finally, Roman revealed his true goal.</p>
<p>“Just as the nobles in the capital have enough power, why don’t we join forces in the northeast to form a force that protects one another? This is why I called for you here.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that moment, all the nobles looked at each other. They belonged to the northeast region, but they never thought they could be a strong force. They had never considered it before. But if they say something wrong here, things will be worse for them, and they may even face Dmitry’s wrath.</p>
<p>Their reactions were understandable. Even in such a small nation, the Central Government was absolute.</p>
<p>‘It doesn’t matter whether they are moved by my words. Once Dmitry starts moving earnestly, the Central Government won’t allow me to play around. So we have to move fast. We need to quickly unite the entire northeast. If the northeast becomes one under Dmitry, the Central Government will not move so hastily. Even within the Central Government, there must be some forces that don’t agree with each other. Moving troops to deal with the entire northeast would be a difficult and troublesome choice.’</p>
<p>The problem of families wasn’t resolved yet. Unless the Central Government becomes hostile, Cairo’s powers won’t give up on Roman.</p>
<p>‘And with the whole northeast in my hands, the next time I go to the capital, a new plan can be made.’</p>
<p>He looked at the nobles. They were worried. Uniting forces is good, but it creates a fatal problem.</p>
<p>“… fine. If we join forces here, we will definitely be able to raise our voices against others. The problem is that the northeast is barren. Some areas, like Lawrence, are fertile for farming, but not all, and each region has its own strengths. Just as Dmitry has mining, most other families have their own means. We bring basic needs from outside with our income for the people, and a fight with the Central Government would halt these purchases.”</p>
<p>Commerce. This was the true problem. Cairo has a capital. The disconnect from the capital was a huge problem, and the Central Government could take advantage of that.</p>
<p>If they go to war with them, they will have to worry about food. They might be fine for a year or two, but in the long run, they would starve.</p>
<p>To which Roman said,</p>
<p>“Commerce is directly linked to the Central Government. If the link isn’t cut, then the local nobles will always end up being dragged around by them. Not all problems can be solved, but if we put our minds to it, there is a way to solve the food crisis.”</p>
<p>And he signaled for the master of the information guild.</p>
<p>Lucas came forward.</p>
<p>“This is the plan for the future.”</p>
<p><em>Drip!</em></p>
<p>Then he opened up the map.</p>
<p>As Lucas said, the map showed the northeast area with a development plan. Everyone’s eyes were focused as they wanted some information.</p>
<p>“The northeast area has more mountains than others, especially behind Dmitry. There are endless mountains all the way to the end of the continent. And we can take advantage of this. A mountain is advantageous for ambushing enemies, and we will build a fortress on the mountains to prepare for emergencies. And by clearing the mountains, we plan to grow crops so the northeast can be self sufficient.”</p>
<p>“Is it possible? Clearing a mountain isn’t a trivial thing.”</p>
<p>Throughout history, thousands of people have tried to scout the mountains. However, they constantly failed, and the local nobles ended up being dependent on the Central Government.</p>
<p>But Roman was different.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is possible.”</p>
<p>In his previous life in the sect, hundreds of kilometers of mountains stretched out—it was the Hundred Thousand Mountains.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Before leaving the Southern Front, Roman ordered Lucas to investigate the endless mountains.</p>
<p>‘The mountains are similar in my past.’</p>
<p>New life? As time passed, it felt closely related to the past. Just like in the past, he was born into a blacksmith family, and behind the family’s estate were mountains like those the sect held.</p>
<p>A coincidence? Or similarity? It wasn’t possible to know yet, but what was certain was that his previous life had given him knowledge about such mountain ranges.</p>
<p>‘The Heavenly Demon Sect was established on the Hundred Thousand Mountains for generations. And we grew accustomed to farming on those slanted, sloping fields, and we managed to build a fortress that was impenetrable to attacks from other sects. It is no different now. If I make good use of these mountains, the northeast can move to a new path.’</p>
<p>And now, Roman told the nobles,</p>
<p>“As shown in the data, we have classified land which can be handled, and some of them are already in the process of reclamation. It’s probably going to take a long time, but if we use the endless mountain range as a last resort rather than a wall, we wouldn’t have to step back ever again.”</p>
<p>“… that is amazing.”</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. From clearing the mountains to making a fortress, Roman was strict and thorough. It wasn’t just a suggestion but a detailed plan.</p>
<p>‘The existence of endless mountains. The meaning of it isn’t so simple. If the endless ranges are used to help the northeast, the fact that the mountains are located behind Dmitry cannot be ignored. And naturally, Dmitry’s power will grow stronger. This is just the start. As soon as Dmitry takes full control of the northeast, I will have the strength to go against the Central Government.’</p>
<p>The Northeast Alliance. There was a reason he saved them. If he had destroyed them, there would have been a lack of money and human resources. And that was only a waste. So instead, he decided to accept them and use them as walls.</p>
<p>When the Central Government comes to attack Dmitry in the future, they will have to come and destroy the Northeast Alliance. It was no longer just a fight between the Central Government and Dmitry.</p>
<p>The dispute with Count Douglas. Roman sided with the northeast and attacked the north to show them the reality. That was how it would be.</p>
<p>If the Central Government attacked the Northeast in the future, it would mean that a power that could stand up to them had come.</p>
<p>‘As time goes by, the northeast will lose its ability to betray me, and they will break away from their connection with the Central Government and only rely on Dmitry. In order to survive in the same area, they will need to move alongside me. Needed evil. Allow them to exist at the price of paying me.’</p>
<p>A plan that started with a simple need. Viscount Conrad would have gone insane if he had known.</p>
<p>All the nobles watched. They initially thought it was reckless, but now they understand.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p>“We will follow the Dmitry family. Lawrence is willing to help with whatever you do.”</p>
<p>“So is the Conrad family. We will help as well.”</p>
<p>Lawrence and Conrad. They moved first. In any case, the tides had turned. If they had to go with Dmitry, they decided that this was the time to be loyal.</p>
<p>It was expected of Lawrence, and Viscount Conrad’s judgment was swift. He had long since abandoned his pride, and every other noble, beginning with him, swore allegiance.</p>
<p>They all spoke up. They all hoped to form a force in the northeast, with Dmitry in the center.</p>
<p>Roman said.</p>
<p>“The name of the alliance in the northeast will now be changed to the Dmitry Alliance.”</p>
<p>One name. Dmitry gave them the new name. And it was finally the moment when the entire northeast was in Dmitry’s grasp.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time…</p>
<p><em>Jiik.</em></p>
<p>Baron Romero tilted his glass.</p>
<p>On the other side was Jonathan.</p>
<p>“Commander. Do you think I am wrong?”</p>
<p>This meeting was of great importance. Baron Romero wanted Roman Dmitry to lead, not him.</p>
<p>Jonathan just drank without saying anything. His blood boiled, but he couldn’t say that to his Lord.</p>
<p>“From the moment I got the nobility title, I have been endlessly thinking about whether the noble life is truly right for me. As a blacksmith since birth, I didn’t fit in with their minds, and I was more used to my regular life. Don’t you realize that too? Who am I? At first, I thought living like this was fine, but when I look back, I can see how stupid I was.”</p>
<p>“Do not say that.”</p>
<p><em>Smile.</em></p>
<p>Baron Romero laughed.</p>
<p>Romero Dmitry. It was not a great name. Despite having power, he never used it, and the family was ignored all this time. And now? At a single word from Roman, everyone looked up to Dmitry, and now a crowd of nobles had gathered as well.</p>
<p>“Dmitry is heading in the right direction. The people are taking pride in the estate now, and the northeast no longer ignores us. So I have decided to step back. For the future, it would be better for Roman to handle the important tasks rather than me.”</p>
<p>He realized this new reality. He was a blacksmith. The position of the Lord didn’t suit him, and he could finally end this succession dilemma.</p>
<p>‘I am sorry to Rodwell, who has suffered until now, but Dmitry’s eldest son cannot be replaced.’</p>
<p>That didn’t mean that the title would be inherited right away. But this was like taking a step back. At the very least, he intended to delegate all external affairs to Roman so that he could seize full control when the time came.</p>
<p>He drank more alcohol. Baron Romero couldn’t hide his feelings.</p>
<p>“So nice.”</p>
<p>On that day, a great change happened within Dmitry.</p>
<p>A transfer of power.</p>
<p>In addition to Baron Romero’s pledge, the nobles who attended the meeting also regarded Roman as the center of the family.</p>
<p>The Dmitry Alliance.</p>
<p>In the capital, nobody knew what had happened that day. As Roman expected, there were people from the capital, but they were so impressed by him that they also joined hands with him.</p>
<p>To be exact, the fight he had with Count Douglas was what made them move. They were scared of how Roman would treat them if the truth got out.</p>
<p>And at the same time that Dmitry was going through a turbulent time, there was someone who had found Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… this is Dmitry. The sacred place for blacksmiths?”</p>
<p>A middle-aged man with a handsome sword hung at his waist.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino.</p>
<p>He followed the trail and arrived at Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 149 - Greedy Collector (1)</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino had a frustrating day last month.</p>
<p>At first, he was convinced that the Master Blacksmith of Dmitry, Hendrick, made Blaze. No one else in the northeast could ever make such a sword. So, as soon as he got the bid for the auction, he sent someone to Dmitry, but he found out his guess was wrong.</p>
<p>“I haven’t put a sword on the auction house lately.”</p>
<p>If Hendrick made Blaze, it would be a masterpiece of a lifetime. Hendrick was excluded from the list because he would have known about his art being sold at an auction house.</p>
<p>From then on, Marquis Valentino’s obsession began, and he used all of his connections and financial resources to visit all of the artisans in the Cairo Kingdom in order to find out who owned Blaze.</p>
<p>“Not me.”</p>
<p>“No one in Cairo can make a sword like this.”</p>
<p>“A sword that accepts mana. Without a doubt, it is a skill that cannot be found even if you search the entire continent.”</p>
<p>The answers that came back made it harder to find the owner. In reality, he had no reason to find out who owned Blaze.</p>
<p>It was greed that stemmed from pure curiosity, and he thought that once he found the owner, he would be happy as a collector.</p>
<p>Was that why? As time went on, his frustration kept growing. The sword was made in Cairo, but the identity of the person couldn’t be discovered.</p>
<p>And Lucas completely erased all his tracks. He simply guessed Hendrick made it because Dmitry was the best blacksmith, but there were no clues.</p>
<p>But just a few days ago…</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino heard good news from his subordinate.</p>
<p>“I heard from someone who met Dmitry’s Master Blacksmith a few days ago. He said that he saw a blade similar to Blaze in the collection. I am not sure if it was a sword made by the same person, but the sword there, which Hendrick boasted about, showed the ability to absorb mana like Blaze. Marquis, what do we do?”</p>
<p>The same ability as Blaze. The justification was enough for him, so he got up, dressed, and got into a carriage.</p>
<p>“To Dmitry right now!”</p>
<p>A few days after that, Marquis Valentino appeared in Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Dmitry’s Master Blacksmith. Hendrick wasn’t an easy person to meet. However, if it was someone like Marquis Valentino, then even Hendrick would move.</p>
<p>“What did you come here for?”</p>
<p>It was a modest office. It was not a place he would normally visit, but he couldn’t help it because of his purpose.</p>
<p>Hendrick was on the opposite side.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino said,</p>
<p>“I will get straight to the point. A month ago, at the Adelian Auction House, I won the bid for a sword called Blaze. As you might know, I am a collector, and unlike Master Hendrick, I didn’t deal with metal all my life, but I think I have an eye to see how valuable it is. Blaze is a treasure, and seeing the sword that perfectly accepts mana, I was convinced that the craftsman who made it was the best in Cairo.”</p>
<p>He gave a signal. Then the knight who was waiting behind him came to present something wrapped in a cloth.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>“This is Blaze.”</p>
<p>Inside the cloth was a sword.</p>
<p><em>Smooth.</em></p>
<p>Hendrick was surprised when he saw it.</p>
<p>‘As I thought.’</p>
<p>Hendrick’s reaction.</p>
<p>It wasn’t the kind of sword he would admire. He was aware of the sword in the first place, but he was surprised that it was in the hands of Marquis Valentino.</p>
<p>It was as Marquis Valentino had expected. He lived as a collector and met many artisans in his life, and he was sure that no one in Cairo could make such a sword other than Hendrick.</p>
<p>To be honest, he doubted Hendrick’s ability too, but he still hasn’t ruled him out yet.</p>
<p>And now…</p>
<p>Hendrick was shocked. Hendrick had some clues about this sword.</p>
<p>“So you realize the value of this sword. A few days ago, I heard from my subordinate that there is a sword similar to this in your collection. That is the purpose of my visit here. By any chance, can you show me the sword?”</p>
<p>His voice was a bit excited. If the report weren’t wrong, Marquis Valentino would finally get the right answer—the owner of the sword.</p>
<p>Or did he know the owner of the sword?</p>
<p>Hendrick’s sword was proof of something.</p>
<p>“Ahem.”</p>
<p>Hendrick was troubled.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino. He heard rumors about this man. It was his first time meeting him in person, but he knew about the avid collector because he often bought items from Dmitry’s blacksmith.</p>
<p>He was a person who could be called a VVIP when making transactions. Some described him as an avid collector, but no artisan thought badly of him.</p>
<p>‘He is famous for giving valuable things and also giving good treatment.’</p>
<p>The competition among collectors could turn evil. He never used evil tricks or methods to take the possessions he wanted, but he was devoted to the makers. And Hendrick could tell from how he was being treated.</p>
<p>If Hendrick were to sell his treasured possessions to anyone, Marquis Valentino would be a suitable buyer for them.</p>
<p>And he meant that because…</p>
<p>‘This person recognizes the value of a sword.’</p>
<p>Actually, Hendrick had been waiting for this moment. He wanted to show off the gift he received, and finally, someone who recognized its value arrived.</p>
<p>A chance. Anticipation had already risen within him, but he tried to maintain a calm voice without displaying too many expressions on his face.</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment. I will show you the sword.”</p>
<p>At those words, Marquis Valentino’s face brightened as if he had conquered the world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He laid down the sword.</p>
<p>Its smooth form caught Marquis Valentino’s eyes, and he checked it in excitement.</p>
<p>‘I am sure. It was made by the same person who made Blaze.’</p>
<p>He hadn’t checked its abilities yet. He still had a few things to check, even on items like this.</p>
<p>Hendrick’s sword looked a lot like Blaze, and the way the light shone splendidly on the blade of the sword made his heart feel cold.</p>
<p>Now, he was sure of it. Even without infusing mana into the sword, he was convinced that this was made by the same person.</p>
<p>Hendrick said,</p>
<p>“The name of the sword is Salamander. As Marquis Valentino seems to be aware, Salamander and Blaze were created by the same person. To be precise, Salamander was the first result, and Blaze came after that.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Marquis Valentino raised his head. Rather than the fact that the same person worked on both swords, the remark about Salamander being the first was etched in his mind.</p>
<p>‘That is the first one?’</p>
<p>His mouth went dry.</p>
<p>The first and second. There was a huge difference. Even though Blaze was a great sword, collectors always put a lot of importance on the first.</p>
<p>The reason was simple. The second would lose value once the third and fourth were made, but the fact that it was the first result made it more valuable.</p>
<p>His heart raced.</p>
<p>The desire he held was so strong.</p>
<p>‘I really want it.’</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino had one iron rule. If the item was founded by a master craftsman, never disregard it. He didn’t make the blunder of coveting the craftsman’s items and instead took possession of items that the craftsman could make.</p>
<p>Hendrick could be the person who made the sword. Knowing that what he was about to say would be disrespectful, Marquis Valentino had no choice but to speak carefully.</p>
<p>“I am being very careful here, but could you probably sell this sword to me? If you sell it, I will pay a fair price for it.”</p>
<p>“I apologize, but this is not for sale. This is a gift, and I think Marquis Valentino will fully understand my feelings about not wanting to sell this item as a collector yourself.”</p>
<p>“… a gift?”</p>
<p>His expression changed. He showed disappointment at the refusal and was shocked to hear that it was a gift.</p>
<p>‘Hendrick didn’t make this sword. If he got this as a gift, then he must know the identity of the person who made it.</p>
<p>He was sure. If he couldn’t buy the sword, he at least wanted to find the true owner.</p>
<p>“Then, may I ask who made the sword?”</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino’s question was what Hendrick was waiting for. From the moment he witnessed Roman making the sword, Hendrick had this unknown itch to let the world know that Dmitry’s firstborn son was a great craftsman.</p>
<p>And the right person appeared on time. Marquis Valentino appeared to be the best person to do that.</p>
<p>“Marquis Valentino. Who do you think made this sword in Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“… Not Baron Romero?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Hendrick shocked Marquis Valentino, who longed to know the truth.</p>
<p>“The eldest son of the Dmitry family, Roman Dmitry, is the person who created the two swords.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He was speechless. Is this what it’s like to be shocked? Marquis Valentino felt so lost by what he heard that he couldn’t say anything for a while.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry made Salamander and Blaze?’</p>
<p>It was so shocking.</p>
<p>The two swords and the artistic work.</p>
<p>He could understand if it was the work of people like Baron Romero and Hendrick, who had spent their entire lives in the forge, but he couldn’t accept that it was the work of Roman, who was in his mid-20s.</p>
<p>But it was evident in his work. There are various types of geniuses in the world, but at least in the realm of artisans who create things, experience and effort are required.</p>
<p>This made no sense. How could someone in his mid-20s make such perfect work?</p>
<p>Moreover…</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is a genius swordsman. And rumor has it that he defeated Butler, a ranker in the Hector Kingdom, Cairo’s greatest genius, and probably a greater swordsman in the future. And if this is true…’</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He clenched his fist. He thought about it. The youngest ranker in the continent. The mere ‘result’ deserves high praise, but the title of ‘craftsman’ is a modifier.</p>
<p>This…. this is terrific.</p>
<p>From the result of the work to the story it had, his heart raced, and he wanted to move quickly.</p>
<p>‘Everyone’s work has an important story. If the person who made the sword were simply an unknown craftsman, it would only be a result, but if it were made by Hendrick, it could be called exclusive. But what if, unexpectedly, the best swordsman makes it? People will give these swords special meaning, and people will want to buy both of them, as they are extremely rare.’</p>
<p>Blaze. It was more than a treasure. People said the winning bid was too high, but when he realized its true value, it felt like a penny.</p>
<p>His eyes blazed as he fell in love.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He wanted to meet him. He wondered how the best swordsman created the best sword.</p>
<p>He jumped up.</p>
<p>“I think I will have to meet Roman Dmitry in person.”</p>
<p>After one month of this unrequited love, it was finally time to meet him in person.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 150 - Greedy Collector (2)</p>
<p>At that time, a training session was taking place at Dmitry’s training hall.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>It was Chris.</p>
<p>Chris, who was watching his opponent with focused eyes, tried to attack with his lightning-fast movement.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The attack was missed.</p>
<p>Chris’s attack was so fast that it was hard to see, but Roman let the opponent come and move with precise timing.</p>
<p>Yet Chris wasn’t too shocked.</p>
<p>As if he had expected this, he blocked Roman’s retreat by using linked attacks.</p>
<p>A sharp attack.</p>
<p>The soldiers watching held their breaths, and Chris, who had been continuously attacking, saw an opportunity in an instant.</p>
<p>‘Right now.’</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>“…!?”</p>
<p>Suddenly, Roman came forward.</p>
<p>The timing that he thought was perfect—a single counterattack—messed up Chris’s breathing, and he got pushed back until he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Your aim was good, Chris. There was nothing wrong with the process of predicting the attack of your opponent and cornering your opponent for a counterattack. The problem is your timing on when you do it. During the momentary burst of power in your attacks, gaps between your attacks will occur. It is a problem that cannot be solved by ordinary means. If your opponent is strong enough to break through that, then you need to have another hit to bring him down.”</p>
<p>“… I will keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>There was no resentment. It was a natural result. Roman never wavered in the face of the attacks, so Chris went ahead and attacked him.</p>
<p>The failure gave him experience. Roman Dmitry showed Chris how a stronger opponent could hit him back, and Chris showed no signs of shame as he stumbled down.</p>
<p>The other soldiers did the same.</p>
<p>People praised Chris and the other soldiers for their performance on the Southern Front and their achievements there and in the tournament, but no matter how much they were praised, they didn’t lose their confidence in front of Roman.</p>
<p>Out of this world. Roman had an overwhelming presence in their eyes. Those who followed such an existence didn’t dare to show a lazy and careless attitude.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>The training continued after Chris, Kevin, McBurney, Henderson, and others. And they all collapsed afterwards. Sparring with Roman was a part of their daily training, and no one could defeat him.</p>
<p>Still, they fought hard. They knew that the more they fought against Roman, the stronger they became, and they learned a lot from it.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s training hall was stained with rough-breathing men. And when the long training was done, Hans, who was waiting in the distance, approached.</p>
<p>“Young Master. We have a guest.”</p>
<p>“Guide me.”</p>
<p>The guest.</p>
<p>He knew who it was.</p>
<p>When Roman shifted his gaze, he looked at Marquis Valentino, who was waiting.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The wait was long. Marquis Valentino waited for two hours, but during that time, he wasn’t truly bored.</p>
<p>‘Is this the class of Roman Dmitry?’</p>
<p>Chris and the others—no one was mediocre here. They proved their skills in the tournament, and each of them showed their ability to hold a strong position in a noble family, especially Chris. He was overwhelming. He was moving so fast that his eyes couldn’t keep up, and he thought that Chris could even take control of the northeast.</p>
<p>Yet he wasn’t a rival for Roman. The strong presence of the swordsmen faded away like nothing when they were in front of Roman.</p>
<p>‘There is a topic that is getting much attention in Cairo. Roman Dmitry defeated the second-place ranker of the Hector Kingdom. People are skeptical and have suggested that he must have been lucky enough to get the chance to take down Butler, but Roman, whom I witnessed now, isn’t someone to be underestimated. A presence that can defeat even talented people like Chris. He possesses more overwhelming skills than the public knows of.’</p>
<p>His heart was beating fast, and if it weren’t for his outstanding presence, Marquis Valentino wouldn’t have been so excited.</p>
<p>‘He is the greatest talent of Cairo, and the sword he made is with me.’</p>
<p>It was such a great sign. At the thought of meeting such a person, he was thrilled, as if he would meet a beautiful woman, and he walked to the waiting room.</p>
<p>Leaving behind the name of Marquis Valentino, he wanted to look good as one human to another.</p>
<p>“I am Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>And he is here.</p>
<p>Roman approached him and extended his hands.</p>
<p>At that moment, it felt like his heart would explode inside of him.</p>
<p>Thinking about the great sword he made with these hands, Marquis Valentino wiped his sweaty hands on his pants and held Roman’s hands.</p>
<p>“I am Marquis Valentino.”</p>
<p>“Please sit down.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>Such a strange atmosphere. The two of them were meeting for the first time today, but the room seemed to be heating up due to Marquis Valentino’s eyes.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino could hardly hide his emotions. It was his first meeting with Roman Dmitry, but he had already felt a connection with him.</p>
<p>And he said,</p>
<p>“The reason I came to Mr. Roman is because of Blaze. I think you know what Blaze is. I was surprised to find such a great treasure at the auction house, and I made sure to get it. To be honest, I’ve been to many places to find out who made it. And today, I came to Dmitry as my final destination.”</p>
<p>His voice was slightly high. People said Marquis Valentino had too much hope and too many wishes for a collector. His feelings were pure and genuine, and that was why he didn’t assert his power here.</p>
<p>“Mr. Roman, are you really the one who made Blaze?”</p>
<p>He asked straight out, his eyes full of longing. It was quite an odd situation. He never expected that his intention to find out the value of the sword would lead him here.</p>
<p>‘People call him the greedy collector.’</p>
<p>Blaze was auctioned off anonymously. He tried to hide his identity in the hope that the value of his name would not have a greater impact on the value of the sword.</p>
<p><em>Grrr.</em></p>
<p>“You are right.”</p>
<p>There was no reason to hide it now.</p>
<p>The statement he was waiting for came, and Marquis Valentino couldn’t hold back his joy anymore.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino. No one in Cairo didn’t know him. Aside from his title as ‘greedy collector,’ he was always mentioned when the power system in Cairo was explained.</p>
<p>‘He has the most power among the neutral forces.’</p>
<p>There were four sides—the royalists, nobles, Kronos, and Valhalla. They shared the power in the Cairo Kingdom, and each of them always wanted to be the one with the upper hand.</p>
<p>In the process, Marquis Valentino received quite an attractive offer. His financial power took control over Cairo’s local businesses, and he held the power to upset the power dynamics, but he showed his stubbornness by staying neutral all these years.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“I am not interested in power. No matter who is in power, I want the Valentino family to always be in the same position.”</p>
<p>He made a clever choice. Everything he does is bound to turn into a battle the moment he firmly supports one side. So he stayed neutral.</p>
<p>He covered his eyes and stayed silent. Whatever Cairo did or didn’t do, he made money and only focused on his hobbies.</p>
<p>He was a key figure in Cairo. He was someone who was strong. And such a great person reacted like a girl to Roman’s words.</p>
<p>“As I thought! Mr. Roman is the owner of Blaze! What an honor! You don’t know how much I wanted to meet you! The first time I saw Blaze at the auction house, it felt like I was hit by lightning. How did you make such a famous sword? Dmitry has always been called the holy land for blacksmiths. Did you get this from your father’s amazing bloodline?”</p>
<p>Questions followed questions. There were no malicious intentions. He just wanted to meet the owner, who turned out to be Roman, and he looked at Roman’s sword.</p>
<p>“… if it isn’t too rude, can I please take a look at your sword?”</p>
<p>Asking to see his sword. If they were on a battlefield, it wouldn’t be allowed. However, Roman handed him his sword. It wasn’t to show trust but to understand Marquis Valentino’s intention.</p>
<p>And he took the sword.</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p>Marquis Valentino gulped.</p>
<p>As if accepting some huge treasure, he carefully touched the sword and checked it out.</p>
<p>‘… this is.’</p>
<p>He was shocked. Blaze and Salamander—they were great swords. That alone made him respect Roman, but this…. Darkness was on a whole different level.</p>
<p>It was a heavy sword that seemed to hold darkness. The eyes of the Marquis, who had witnessed numerous famous swords, recognized the true value of Darkness at once.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a great craftsman. It wasn’t something like a flame cooling down to display the result, but it was a gradual development.</p>
<p>The first sword Salamander.</p>
<p>The second Blaze.</p>
<p>The third Darkness.</p>
<p>‘Every time a new sword is made, there is rapid growth that can be noticed. If Roman Dmitry is called the greatest genius of all time as a swordsman, it should be the same as a blacksmith. How much greater will the swords he creates in the future be? And if Roman Dmitry continues to gain fame, the swords he creates will become extremely valuable.’</p>
<p>This was a shock.</p>
<p>Blaze. People thought he spent too much on a sword. He wasn’t sure what it was, but when he saw Darkness, Marquis Valentino felt like he saw the future.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was going to be the best swordsman and craftsman in the world.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He placed the sword down and looked at Roman with a serious face.</p>
<p>“Even if I asked you to sell this sword, I doubt you would agree. Which is why I will say this, could you please grant me a special request?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The special request had two conditions.</p>
<p>“First, if you’re going to sell the sword, give me a chance to obtain it.”</p>
<p>A personal desire. If Roman would let go of Darkness as he did with Blaze, then Marquis Valentino wanted to be the one to get it.</p>
<p>“Second, please let me know if a new sword is made. No, if possible, I would like to see the swords you’ve made. The place and time don’t matter. Be it in Dmitry, some faraway nation, or a remote area that doesn’t allow humans. If Mr. Roman allows it, I’d like to come and check the state of the swords.”</p>
<p>His eyes gleamed with longing. But Roman didn’t answer him.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino, Cairo’s business tycoon, was burning. Rather than asking questions to know his intentions, Roman waited for him to spill them.</p>
<p>“If you promise me two things, the Valentino family will support Dmitry in the future.”</p>
<p>Those words were more than he expected. He made a statement about giving up his neutral position simply because he was a collector.</p>
<p>It was fun.</p>
<p>Roman looked into Marquis Valentino’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you really know what that means?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. The Valentino family has maintained a neutral position. Thanks to that, there were no problems when running the guild, and people ended up calling us the most wealthy family.”</p>
<p>“Then why support Dmitry? I don’t think this is just a desire to collect. To meet your desires, your family will have to make too many sacrifices.”</p>
<p>A neutral force taking a side. Even if the opponents weren’t the four factions, this would be inconvenient for those in power in Cairo.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino said,</p>
<p>“I will be honest. Actually, the four factions have been putting pressure on us. In a situation where the power struggle in Cairo is turning intense, we cannot hold onto the neutral position anymore. So I was pondering which side to support. Would I prefer the nobles or Kronos or Valhalla? When I was deep in thought, I overheard the rumors about Roman Dmitry. They say you defeated the lords of the north and established the Dmitry Alliance.”</p>
<p>His request wasn’t something he decided on the spot. Until meeting Roman, he calculated the profit and loss.</p>
<p>“People call me a greedy collector. I pay a fair price for good things of value, but I am not limited to that alone. I like investing in people. When a person who is still undervalued develops and achieves something, it gives me tremendous pleasure.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry and his unexpected actions. People only paid attention to how he defeated his enemies, but he noticed the leadership he showed.</p>
<p>And the Dmitry Alliance. Dmitry, who was in a neutral position like him, also showed their intention to change.</p>
<p>“Of the four factions, there is none that follows. But with Roman, it is a different story. Seeing how you took control of the northeast, which was a mess, I decided that Mr. Roman leading Dmitry is worth investing in. Furthermore, I even confirmed that you are the one who made Blaze, so why wouldn’t I like you?”</p>
<p>“Dmitry has a lot of money. Is there any reason to accept the Valentino family as an ally when the Central Government will keep checking on us?”</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino knew that the other person had no intention of following the trend, and he had the courage to act unconventionally.</p>
<p>Amazing.</p>
<p>The richest man in Cairo.</p>
<p>He wasn’t as he expected.</p>
<p>“I am very aware of how much wealth Dmitry has. But…”</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino smiled.</p>
<p>“Isn’t it better to have more money? I am not asking for much. If we can build a relationship with Roman, then as long as Valentino is alive and in Cairo, we will do anything for Dmitry.”</p>
<p>The collector’s instinct—the sense that brought Marquis Valentino to his current position—desired Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 151 - Greedy Collector (3)</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino was quite an interesting person. Despite the fact that Dmitry was still a marginal force, he boldly chose to side with them.</p>
<p>The four factions of Cairo. It was clear that they would show dissatisfaction with Marquis Valentino’s decision. When he was a neutral force, they had no reason to attack him directly, but now they probably will.</p>
<p>It was a foolish choice to make. If he had followed the nobles of Marquis Benedict, he would have already held amazing power in his hands, but he abandoned such a stable choice for this gamble.</p>
<p>There was no reason to refuse him. In a situation where a strong ally was joining him, Roman showed a calm reaction.</p>
<p>“I admit that if Valentino supports Dmitry, we can rise to a new power.”</p>
<p>However, Roman didn’t just accept it all because it was beneficial for him. There were clear standards that Valentino had to meet.</p>
<p>“But, as you know, Dmitry has no close relationships. If the Dmitry family has yet to accomplish anything, Valentino’s support will almost certainly grant us equal status, regardless of what happens later. I do not like that. The Dmitry Alliance. The nobles in the northeast region didn’t support Dmitry without a reason, and they all pledged their loyalty to stay with me.”</p>
<p>He looked straight into Marquis Valentino’s eyes. Roman didn’t want the power system he built to crumble, no matter how well-known the opponent was or what benefit was offered.</p>
<p>“Dmitry doesn’t need the help of anyone. We have the power and ability to solve problems, and in the process of forming the Dmitry Alliance and moving forward, all we need is the loyalty of the people. Let me ask you one thing, then. Can the Valentino family follow Dmitry? Are you ready to do anything for the Dmitry family instead of just standing on the sidelines?”</p>
<p>He asked him back.</p>
<p>Valentino and Dmitry.</p>
<p>Valentino had a great reputation that everyone knew about. And having them support Dmitry was incredible, but Roman was not the type to be satisfied with that.</p>
<p>What…. What was the source of his confidence? Marquis Valentino’s eyes shuddered as he looked at Roman.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry doesn’t care about the four factions within Cairo. If he turns down the offer, there will be trouble, but Roman doesn’t seem to be afraid of anything. Is it because he is young? No, that cannot be. The hero of Cairo, who has led Dmitry to control the northeast region at once and made remarkable contributions in the war against the Hector Kingdom, he is something more than we see.’</p>
<p><em>Sigh.</em></p>
<p><em>Laugh.</em></p>
<p>What was the most important thing for a collector?</p>
<p>The rarity of an object.</p>
<p>The empires that ruled the continent might have had a lot of talented people, but this man here was the type of person who couldn’t be found in a weak nation like Cairo.</p>
<p>‘I am very attracted to Roman Dmitry.’</p>
<p>He felt his heart tremble.</p>
<p>At first, he wasn’t that interested in power. As long as Valentino stayed alive and rich, it didn’t matter what was happening around him. So he had to be the best.</p>
<p>The opponent. Even if he was from a commoner-born Baron family…..</p>
<p>“Let me take this chance to clarify my words. If you accept my offer, Valentino will follow Dmitry. Even if we have to hold on to the last straw or jump into the pits of hell, if it is an order from you, I will smile and follow.”</p>
<p>It was an unusual choice for Valentino to make. Even though he made a choice that most people wouldn’t make, Roman calmly accepted the loyalty of the Valentino family.</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk was used to loyal people. He had confidence in himself and did not consider Valentino as some higher noble.</p>
<p>“I wish us well in the future.”</p>
<p>That was all. Even if this would cause a mess in the outside world, it could be dealt with in time. The meeting of the two families formed an unexpected connection.</p>
<p>As it came to a warm end, Marquis Valentino asked one last question.</p>
<p>“… may I go back home and reveal that the person who made Blaze is Roman Dmitry? I have received such a great sword that I don’t think I can hold myself back from boasting about it.”</p>
<p>It was definite. Marquis Valentino was quite a unique human.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Greedy collector. As much as he had a great collection, he loved showing them off too. He invited the nobles who lived near the capital to have a simple tea gathering, and when the atmosphere seemed nice, he subtly showed off Blaze.</p>
<p>“Ohh.”</p>
<p>“Is this that amazing sword?”</p>
<p>All the eyes of the nobles shone at Blaze. Blaze’s reputation was quite high among the nobles, as the bid was known to have been won with a huge amount of money.</p>
<p>A sword that amplified the aura’s abilities. It was a skill that would make any person gape at the mere rumors, and the fact that it was a sword obtained by the greedy collector ensured its quality.</p>
<p>Marquis Valentino said,</p>
<p>“Ahem. I don’t know what rumors everyone has heard, but this sword is more than just the rumors. I recently conducted a simple experiment with a subordinate of mine. A 1-star swordsman wielded Blaze against a 2-star swordsman, and surprisingly, the 1-star swordsman managed to block the 2-star swordsman.”</p>
<p>“For real?”</p>
<p>“Have I ever lied about the things I collected? Furthermore…”</p>
<p>He lowered his voice, and his lips were twitching in enjoyment.</p>
<p>“The identity of the craftsman who created Blaze is Roman Dmitry. The hero of Cairo, who has defeated the Hector Kingdom, and the eldest son of the Dmitry family, the blacksmith family. He made Blaze.”</p>
<p>“WHAT?!”</p>
<p>“You mean this is Roman Dmitry’s sword?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Roman Dmitry made three swords in his lifetime, and Blaze is the second of them. And when he went to war against the Hector Kingdom, Roman Dmitry used Blaze to defeat Butler. Isn’t that amazing? I only looked at the sword’s quality to determine its worth, but the true value of the sword is quite different, right? Roman Dmitry is a talented person who will become the best swordsman in Cairo in the future, and the sword that he created will be the greatest treasure.”</p>
<p>Everyone was shocked. Only then did they realize that, while the amount of money bet by Marquis Valentino was small, the sword’s value would skyrocket in the future.</p>
<p>Their eyes admired it at first, but now they were stained with envy. Aside from its current value, they were envious of the fact that Roman had only made three swords, and this was one of them.</p>
<p>Rumors spread fast about Valentino’s sword and that Roman Dmitry made it. People praised the sword’s performance and exclaimed in admiration for the story it held. The value of the sword rose to the heavens.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. When people doubted the ability of the sword, Marquis Valentino called craftsmen to display its features.</p>
<p>“… this sword is a lot greater than the rumors. I have seen many famous swords in my life, but I have never seen a sword accept mana in this manner. To be honest, if I had the money, I would definitely want to buy this.”</p>
<p>The words of the craftsmen put an end to all the doubts. People now paid attention to the swords made by Roman, and started calling the three swords the ‘Roman Dmitry Collection.’</p>
<p>And those rumors brought about unexpected results.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the forge of Dmitry, it was a busy day. It was normal for them to receive a large number of orders, but with rumors about Roman circulating, the number of orders increased.</p>
<p>“You want to buy the sword of Young Master Roman?”</p>
<p>“It is impossible. Young Master Roman does not sell swords.”</p>
<p>“It is possible for us to process orders for up to 100 people, but you will have to wait for at least a month due to the backlog right now. I apologize. Dmitry has a lot of blacksmiths, but right now, we cannot process the orders quickly.”</p>
<p>At first, they asked about Roman’s sword. Naturally, in a situation where they were rejected, they decided to just submit a production request to the Dmitry family.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry, the creator of the treasured sword. Wasn’t this his family’s business? Even if it wasn’t, Dmitry was well known in the nation for their blacksmiths, and as a result, trust in them grew.</p>
<p>And the Dmitry family didn’t disappoint their clients. More orders were placed after people who had received the best quality equipment spoke up.</p>
<p>The fire in the furnace never stopped. The blacksmiths had no time to rest, and they enjoyed the greatest financial boom in Dmitry’s history.</p>
<p>And that fact was reported to Baron Romero.</p>
<p>“… this is the situation. Thanks to Young Master Roman’s name, we have processed more than half of the year’s orders.”</p>
<p>It was Hendrick. His expression was bright. The prosperity of the forge was welcomed by all the blacksmiths, and he was genuinely happy that people recognized Roman’s worth.</p>
<p>“Kuahahaha. Everyone wants to covet my son’s sword.”</p>
<p>Baron Romero also laughed loudly.</p>
<p>His reputation as a swordsman was surely amazing, and he was happy. His son’s success was, of course, a delight to his mind and heart, but this made him feel even better.</p>
<p>“Roman, Rodwell, and Lauren. My sons followed me in and out of the forge at a young age, but none of them took it so seriously. In fact, I thought it would happen. I grew up in a forge and worked there my whole life, but they were born into noble families and had a different life than I did. And now Roman has made a sword that the Cairo Kingdom admires. This makes me happy.”</p>
<p>He had three sons, and the eldest one, whom he considered his successor, was now being accepted everywhere. When his eldest son revealed his talent as a blacksmith, Baron Romero couldn’t help but be genuinely happy.</p>
<p>“Yes. Young Master Roman was born with the talent to lead.”</p>
<p>“You think so? Hahaha.”</p>
<p>The issue of succession. Roman was someone he had a lot of trouble with. Roman had lost the lead due to the mess he was in a couple of years ago, but now he had no more doubts about him. He was sure of it. Roman Dmitry was the perfect heir to the Dmitry family.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the world was buzzing, Roman met an unexpected visitor.</p>
<p>“Long time no see.”</p>
<p>It was McKean, a member of the Valhalla Intelligence. He, who had previously offered a chance to recruit Roman, reappeared after a long time.</p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“Recently, we have been receiving rumors about Mr. Roman. You are amazing. Defeating the Hector Kingdom wasn’t enough. You even defeated Butler. I thought I knew you already, Roman Dmitry. But we also seemed to have underestimated you.”</p>
<p>The Valhalla Empire. They have been uncomfortable lately. The fact that Roman Dmitry was a 4-star swordsman was no secret, and all four factions in Cairo were actively moving.</p>
<p>In particular, Marquis Benedict was quite active. Seeing that he was ready to give up his daughter, whom he treasured so much, for marriage, Valhalla decided that they had to get Roman now.</p>
<p>And…</p>
<p>“If we could, we would give Mr. Roman time to think it over. But we changed our minds after seeing the Dmitry Alliance being formed in the northeast. What are you thinking? Do you intend to form a different faction in Cairo?”</p>
<p>The Dmitry Alliance. Rumors couldn’t be suppressed. Eventually, it reached Valhalla’s ears, and they thought they could not give him any more time.</p>
<p>“The leaders of Valhalla are suspicious of Roman Dmitry’s intentions behind this. Because of the possibility that you would swear allegiance to Valhalla, the Dmitry family has faced no threats until now. If you have other intentions, we want a definite answer. If you want to remain a member of Cairo and not Valhalla, the Valhalla Empire will not leave loose ends.”</p>
<p>His eyes were sharp. The favor was gone. His eyes were full of killing intent, and he didn’t smile.</p>
<p>The Dmitry Alliance blew the fuse. The power system, which had been intertwined around Roman Dmitry, showed signs of beginning to collapse.</p>
<p>“Choose. Will you follow Valhalla, or will you stay as our enemy?”</p>
<p>It was one-sided. The moment the offer was declined, the favor turned to hostility.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p><em>Kiik.</em></p>
<p>Roman leaned back on the chair and looked at McKean.</p>
<p>Roman showed a cold expression.</p>
<p>“I see what you mean, but why should I stick with the choices you give?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 152 - Greedy Collector (4)</p>
<p>The atmosphere was chilly and cold. At the explicit refusal and the somewhat aggressive response, McKean said,</p>
<p>“Those words. Should I accept them as hostility?”</p>
<p>After all, the Cairo Kingdom was a weak nation. And within that small nation, there were four factions fighting one another.</p>
<p>The same went for Roman Dmitry. He was highly regarded because he defeated Butler in his mid-20s, but he lacked the strength to overcome the nation’s powerhouses.</p>
<p>Roman’s answer was important. And the Valhalla Empire had the power to trample on a being like Roman.</p>
<p>“Speak clearly. From the moment you threaten me, I have no intention of being nice to you.”</p>
<p>His voice was firm.</p>
<p>Roman looked at the man in front of him. Even though the opponent showed such bloody intentions, neither his body nor his eyes were shaking.</p>
<p>“The Valhalla Empire. It isn’t that I don’t know how strong you are, but I have no intention of being forced into allegiance to anyone, even if you point a sword at me. Do you want to accept this as hostility? Do whatever you want. Either instigate the Central Government to attack Dmitry or summon your warriors in Valhalla to assassinate me. No threat can force the answer from me.”</p>
<p>The Valhalla Empire was strong. But Roman knew that even the Valhalla Empire had its limits.</p>
<p>‘The Cairo Kingdom is the prey that the Kronos Empire has worked hard for. If Valhalla attacked Cairo now, Kronos wouldn’t stand still. In the end, the fight in Cairo will end in internal strife. And the power of Dmitry now cannot be threatened by the Central Government alone.’</p>
<p>Things weren’t so simple when it came to dealing with the Dmitry Alliance. When the Central Government decides to punish them, it would require them to take power from the surrounding estates, but all the forces in the northeast follow Dmitry.</p>
<p>And Count Denver, who followed Valhalla. Even if he raised his voice and said Dmitry should be punished, the Central Government would not wage war because of threats from outside forces.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire was also holding back, and if a civil war broke out, Cairo would have no choice but to fall into an abyss. And the fall of Cairo means the rise of Kronos.</p>
<p>Roman knew that by forming an alliance, he would hold the most important position.</p>
<p>‘Valhalla has no way to attack me, not even once. There is no way that they would assassinate me by mobilizing the most powerful people in Valhalla, so this kind of threat won’t work on me.’</p>
<p>He received numerous assassination threats during the days he lived as Baek Joong-hyuk. No matter what kind of assassination was attempted, Roman was sure that he wouldn’t even have to blink an eye.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“If you do not intend to be my enemies, Valhalla only has one option to choose. And that is to wait. I, Roman Dmitry, do not want to be a parasite on someone else’s power. The moment I make a choice, the force will surely rise to the pinnacle of Cairo, and the people will call the Dmitry family a kingmaker. That is what I hope for.”</p>
<p>He gave them a reason to shut their mouths and wait for his choice. Despite the threats from the Valhalla Empire, Roman came out strong.</p>
<p>The world didn’t know of the union between Dmitry and Valentino. But Dmitry’s power on its own was enough to make a bold move against the Valhalla Empire.</p>
<p>“… you are acting so bold.”</p>
<p>McKean’s face hardened, as he didn’t like this situation. Roman’s attitude was clearly crossing the line, but he couldn’t attack Roman. After the war with Hector and the unification of the northeast, he knew Dmitry was now untouchable.</p>
<p>‘I have to take a step back. But if he continues to show the same attitude as now, then we will have to make a decision.’</p>
<p>McKean said,</p>
<p>“If you act all stiff with that neck, it will break one day. Roman Dmitry, make sure to keep these words in your mind. We are stepping back not because you are strong but because we are giving you time. You are no threat to the Valhalla Empire. The continent is huge, and keep in mind that Butler, whom you fought, is a base level of power in Valhalla, so make a decision after carefully considering everything. If you decide the same, then….. then I will show you just how pointless your sandcastles are.”</p>
<p>He gave a warning and backed down.</p>
<p>Then McKean stood up and began to leave.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Starting with Valhalla, calls came from all factions in Cairo. They knew about the existence of the Dmitry Alliance, and every one of them urged him to make a decision. Some were trying to appease him, and some gave him threats.</p>
<p>And when the powerhouses in Cairo were quickly making their moves, Roman stood his ground.</p>
<p>“Currently, I have a lot of things to do in Dmitry. Exactly one year later, after finishing the work in Dmitry, I plan to move to the capital and challenge the Public Ranking. And if everything is done, at the same time, I will reveal my decision.”</p>
<p>One year. They didn’t want to wait. All four factions were already feeling like they had been betrayed by Roman, whom they wanted to decide right then.</p>
<p>The leader of the nobility, Marquis Benedict, didn’t like Roman’s one-sided talks, and like Valhalla, he couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p>“… will you leave the Dmitry family alone?”</p>
<p>A subordinate asked him.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict fixed his gaze on the papers in front of him.</p>
<p>“We have no other choice but to wait. Our chance might have been after the war with Hector, but after that, Roman Dmitry returned to his home and made the most unconventional move to unite the forces. What an evil-minded boy! From the moment the northeast, which rebelled against Dmitry, surrendered to him, the Dmitry family turned into something that even the Central Government couldn’t touch. To be precise, if we do touch them, the balance of power will collapse.”</p>
<p>“But this is risky. Give Dmitry time, and they will expand further.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Marquis Benedict turned over the papers, and he looked at his subordinate. He did not become the leader of the noble faction by chance.</p>
<p>“Let us face the reality. We cannot gain benefits if we antagonize Dmitry, so it is better to pin our hopes on a better chance. Surely, the royal family has no choice but to disapprove of Roman Dmitry’s actions. Unlike them, we will stand by Roman Dmitry until the end and treat him well so that he can trust me. Even if the price for waiting ends up in betrayal, Roman Dmitry is worth putting everything on the line.”</p>
<p>The hero of Cairo. He was someone everyone would want to covet. He also wanted to have the man and decided to make a bold move.</p>
<p>“If only Roman Dmitry would choose me. I won’t make an issue of what happened all this time. But….”</p>
<p>His voice lowered.</p>
<p>Blind loyalty. It was something that could lead to betrayal too.</p>
<p>“If the route he would take is different from mine, then I will make sure he pays the price.”</p>
<p>Just one year. That was the longest time he could wait.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Roman was reading a letter in the library.</p>
<p>[Brother. I’ve never been happy about being at the academy all this time. But ever since you visited me, my life has completely changed. The kids who were afraid of the Castro family began to approach me as friends, and my sword skills developed rapidly as I worked hard on what Brother taught me. Not too long ago, I even heard a compliment from our swordsmanship teacher that I might be a genius. Thank you very much. As your younger brother, I did nothing for you, but Brother gave me so much. There is nothing I can do for you right now, but I will live my life step by step and repay the favor I received from you.]</p>
<p>It was Lauren Dmitry.</p>
<p>At the sincere letter, Roman smiled.</p>
<p>‘Brothers, huh? This isn’t so bad.’</p>
<p>This life was different from the previous one. He had no reason or intention to fight with his brothers now. The fact that they could exchange such warm greetings while being siblings was special for Roman.</p>
<p>‘I need to get stronger in a year.’</p>
<p>Many people were now involved in Roman’s plan. He was no longer alone and could no longer accept defeat.</p>
<p>‘Using the power system is now at its limit. The king’s faction, the noble faction, the Kronos Empire, and the Valhalla Empire. These four forces are dividing the nation and will not wait for me. So, in this one year, if I don’t make use of this time in a good manner, I will lose everything in the war against them.’</p>
<p>He couldn’t falter now. His family, subordinates, and maybe his own life could come to an end. Whatever it was, he wouldn’t let it stop him.</p>
<p>Living his new life, Roman had many hopes, and like in his previous life, he wanted to rise to the supreme position without having to lose anything. And unlike in his previous life, Roman Dmitry, who lived as Byeok Joong-hyuk, now had the power to be greedy.</p>
<p>‘When the war really starts, there won’t be any time to look back.’</p>
<p>The mid-state of the Heavenly Demon Sword would not be enough. Although it worked against Butler, Roman wanted something more overwhelming.</p>
<p>He had one year to make progress. He would have to work harder than before and prepare for another thing in the future.</p>
<p>‘Edwin Hector. I never know when I will come across a magician like him again. To respond perfectly to whatever variables arise, I must first understand magicians. Even if a magician more powerful than Edwin Hector comes, I need to be able to behead them to accomplish my goal.’</p>
<p>At a time when he had nothing to lose, Baek Joong-hyuk struggled to survive. And now, with so much at stake, Roman Dmitry has shown a stronger will than ever.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Three months have passed since then.</p>
<p>There were thirteen Magic Towers on the continent, and Phoenix was the weakest of them all. And they had a problem that plagued them.</p>
<p>“Ehhh.”</p>
<p>The heir to Phoenix, Felix, sighed.</p>
<p>There was a magic society. It was hosted by the Vast Heavens Magic Tower, and it was a place where the representatives of each Magic Tower would prove their achievements.</p>
<p>The problem was that it was Phoenix’s turn, and even though Felix showed off a powerful 5-circle magic at the age of thirty, all the other magicians looked at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p>Felix’s magic was common. There were widely known magics, and the Phoenix Magic Tower’s identity did not appear to be particularly unique.</p>
<p>“It seems to be true that the Phoenix Magic Tower has lost the magic books that have been handed down for generations.”</p>
<p>Three years ago, Felix’s teacher and the Magic Tower master had gone missing.</p>
<p>As a result, Felix took on the role of acting master. But the problem was that he completely lost the power his position held as he didn’t inherit the magic books of the Magic Tower called Burning.</p>
<p>Even if it weren’t so, the power of their Magic Tower was weak. It came to the point that their tower fell, and their magicians were leaving every day.</p>
<p>The magician’s world was cold. Since the Vast Heaven Magic Tower was known to possess the best magic in the world, there was no reason to stay humble towards the Phoenix magicians who lost their own technique.</p>
<p>“… it would die in an instant.”</p>
<p>The words spoke of an unknown future.</p>
<p>Usually, the Magic Tower borrows some land with support from the nation. However, since their master’s disappearance, Felix has been passively supporting the magicians.</p>
<p>It felt shocking. At first, he acted as if he would give up any body organ for the Magic Tower, but now, it just looks like a nuisance to everyone.</p>
<p>The Magic Tower and the kingdom were mutually beneficial. The Magic Tower provides living conditions, and the kingdom could borrow the power of the Magic Tower in emergencies.</p>
<p>“As the days go by, my worries continue to grow.”</p>
<p>Felix got a letter.</p>
<p>[… the conditions are simple. For the next six months, if you become my opponent, I will reward you 1,000 gold each month.]</p>
<p>It was an unusual request, but the 1,000 gold made it worth considering. And wasn’t the Magic Tower in a bad situation now? Then he couldn’t refuse this request.</p>
<p>Frank was a nation in the southwest of the continent. It was a long journey to get such letters, and no one in such distant lands ever gets such a request.</p>
<p>‘It’s the farthest end, the northeast. So far.’</p>
<p>On that day, Felix packed up and headed for his destination.</p>
<p>The place was Dmitry in the Cairo Kingdom.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 153 - Dealing With Magicians (1)</p>
<p><em>Clack clack.</em></p>
<p>Inside the carriage to Dmitry, Felix checked the documents he had prepared in advance.</p>
<p>‘Dmitry. A place called the holy land for blacksmiths in the Cairo Kingdom.’</p>
<p>He heard rumors about it. The quality of metal in Cairo was very good, and most of them were known to come from Dmitry.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t a place that would interest Felix much. Swordsmen who handle swords would consider Dmitry a great place, but most magicians would go to Kronos.</p>
<p>Among the thirteen Magic Towers in the continent, seven of them, including the Heavenly Lord, belonged to Kronos. The Magic Towers were clearly classified as a neutral force, but as the majority of the Magic Towers were in Kronos, Kronos was evaluated as a sacred place for magicians.</p>
<p>And Phoenix also wanted to settle in Kronos. It was safe to say that the infrastructure for magic was the best in Kronos. But that couldn’t happen due to Frank’s weak power.</p>
<p>And to Felix, the Cairo Kingdom had no merit. There were no Magic Towers in that place, and the kingdom’s level to nurture its magicians was very low.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the letter from Roman Dmitry, Felix would have never even set foot in this place.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. A genius swordsman who appeared in the Cairo Kingdom and is the youngest person to get a rank by defeating Butler. He didn’t get an official rank yet, but no one doubts his skills.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—the main character of this story. Even Felix knew about his huge reputation.</p>
<p>Usually, weak nations manage to get two to three people in the Public Ranking, but Roman Dmitry defeated Butler in his mid-20s. It was something that people talked about.</p>
<p>Starting from the 50th rank, no one would dare call the name of that person or his nation weak, except for the empire. After the birth of a genius who could break the boundary for the first time, even people in Frank remembered the name ‘Roman Dmitry.’</p>
<p>If it was an invitation from Roman Dmitry himself, he thought it was worth trusting. Besides, according to what he heard and found out, wasn’t the Dmitry family well-known in Cairo?</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry gave his word that 1,000 gold for a month would be provided just to spar with him. What could he be thinking? What could be his reason for contacting me from a faraway nation of unknown origins? For the Phoenix Magic Tower, getting 6,000 gold for half a year is a good amount. We can survive for a while.’</p>
<p>His head was full of complicated thoughts about Dmitry. If the Magic Tower master hadn’t disappeared, then Felix wouldn’t have been suffering like this.</p>
<p><em>Shh!</em></p>
<p>And he pulled the curtains.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Outside the window, he could see Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The truth was that he had prejudices against Dmitry. The territory of Cairo itself wasn’t amazing, so it was said that the nations on its outskirts would be lax.</p>
<p>And now? From the distance, a massive mansion could be seen.</p>
<p>“… this is Dmitry.”</p>
<p>The outer wall. Dmitry mobilized their family’s craftsmen to build the strongest and tallest wall in Cairo. The gray walls of the estate would overwhelm the people just by looking at them, and the magic circles on them were donned for magic attacks.</p>
<p>This was too much preparation for such a sthemall estate. Even if it was an estate of the most well-known family in Cairo, this seemed too much.</p>
<p>Furthermore….</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>The mighty steel gates. Dmitry’s guards moved in perfect order and aimed their bows. Even though this wasn’t wartime, they asked for the business of those who wished to enter.</p>
<p>“Please state the purpose of your visit.”</p>
<p>“My name is Felix of the Phoenix Magic Tower. I came here upon the invitation of Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>“I will check it for a moment.”</p>
<p>Felix stepped out of the carriage and identified himself. The waiting time was short. The guards had been given a guest list in advance, and after checking Felix’s name there, they opened the outer gate of the two gates.</p>
<p>Even if something went wrong, it was to halt the movement of the intruders only until the gate, at which point they would be unable to enter the estate.</p>
<p><em>Kiik!</em></p>
<p>The gates opened. The guards proceeded with the inspections in a well-organized manner. Some looked at Felix’s face more carefully, and some at the carriage. This made him admire the place. Normally, the estates on the outskirts are lax with security, and they don’t have a system in place, but Dmitry’s guards didn’t appear to be.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. Felix’s eyes trembled as the guards marched by.</p>
<p>‘This isn’t a lie. At the very least, they received enough training to have their own system.’</p>
<p>It was unexpected. Dmitry was famous for its blacksmiths. The family’s power was not highly regarded, but what he witnessed made him change his opinion of them.</p>
<p>After such a bold but short security check, what greeted Felix were the neatly moving roads and various types of buildings.</p>
<p>‘It is certain. The Dmitrys are not the type of people who take their lives lightly on the outskirts. The well-thought movements of the guards, the solid walls, and the interior show how much the Dmitry family is investing their money into making a good environment for their people. A family like this is being looked down on just for being on the outskirts. As expected, rumors can’t be trusted.’</p>
<p>Suddenly, even before reaching the mansion, an amazing image unfolded before his eyes.</p>
<p>If the shabby environment was like slums only a year ago, now it was beautiful. After a major investment from the mines, Baron Romero reflected on Roman’s opinion and actively changed the estate.</p>
<p>In preparation for an unexpected war, he didn’t just train the soldiers. He got the walls repaired and also changed the living style of the people.</p>
<p>Even before, Baron Romero was kind to his people, but he lacked experience dealing with the flaws in people’s personalities, and this time he took Roman’s advice.</p>
<p>In just one year, Dmitry had changed. Felix, who had just stepped into Dmitry, couldn’t think of any other version of this place.</p>
<p>‘Maybe I underestimated Dmitry?’</p>
<p>As he began to rethink his opinion, Felix’s expectations increased.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The moment he met Roman Dmitry, it was as he expected. He knew that his expectations, which had been inflated, wouldn’t be wrong.</p>
<p>“I am Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>A powerful voice and a charming appearance. After simply shaking hands, Felix felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>‘He is no ordinary person.’</p>
<p>He hid his amazement. This meeting had a purpose. Since the deal wasn’t finalized yet, he didn’t want to give away his emotions.</p>
<p>“I will get straight to the point. First of all, please make sure that the conditions stated in the letter are true. If you can guarantee that they are, how about we start discussing the other details seriously right away?”</p>
<p>These were the words he uttered as soon as he sat down. 1,000 gold per month—it was the statement that brought Felix here. No matter what was promised, Felix decided to leave if there was even a slight change in the conditions.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“As stated in the letter, our conditions are clear. I will give you 1,000 gold every month, a total of 6,000 for six months, on the condition that you fight me daily. We are willing to pay you first on the first day of each month if you want. 1,000 gold isn’t a small amount, but we thought giving them beforehand would make you trust us more.”</p>
<p>“… they are good terms.”</p>
<p>Advance payment to build trust. If he himself said it, then it couldn’t be a lie. He believed in Roman Dmitry. He knew that he would have to pay that back if he could not do it right, but what didn’t sit well with him was why he was going this far.</p>
<p>“Honestly, I do not understand this. The purpose is to have simple fights, which means there is no need to spend such a large amount. If you just give away 100 gold, a lot of magicians will definitely come. But going all the way to the Phoenix Magic Tower to make a proposal? I want to know why you made a deal by offering me 1,000 gold?”</p>
<p>Roman definitely wanted Felix. He looked into Roman’s eyes, hoping for an answer, and Roman didn’t hide the truth.</p>
<p>“If you ask me like that, I will not drag it any further. Although your Magic Tower has been struggling a bit recently, the Phoenix Magic Tower was called one of the best talent holders in the continent when it was doing well. And you, Felix, can use 5-circle magic at the age of thirty. In particular, I heard that the fire magic is quite unique to the magic tower. 1,000 gold. It may not be a huge amount of money for most Magic Towers, but the situation at the Phoenix Magic Tower isn’t good. So I decided that I would buy your time. That was all. I wanted the most outstanding magician at one point to spar with me.”</p>
<p>It was an honest statement. Even though Roman gave him a nice evaluation, the statement about his Magic Tower’s failure made him unable to smile.</p>
<p>“I don’t expect much from Mr. Felix. However, I want you to do your best. In the process, you will not be held responsible for any injuries or deaths, so make sure to give it your all. If you can promise me that, then Dmitry will not break the deal with Mr. Felix.”</p>
<p>And at that point, Felix showed a strange expression. He wanted him to do his best. For some reason, it sounded as if Roman was sure of winning.</p>
<p>Was that why?</p>
<p>“You will really not regret it, right?”</p>
<p>Felix provoked him back.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They headed to the training hall. On their way, he asked Roman again, but he just told him to do his best.</p>
<p>‘Roman must be sure about winning. Is he being sincere, or is he just taking things lightly?’</p>
<p>Whatever it was, he didn’t like it. His own magic wasn’t weak enough to be handled easily for six months, and Roman said,</p>
<p>“I will give up the advantage, so attack first.”</p>
<p>It was a statement that lit the fire for Felix. When Roman said he’d give up the advantage and let him take the first hit, he smiled. This hurt his pride.</p>
<p>“Well, I won’t back down.”</p>
<p>And he raised his mana.</p>
<p>6,000 gold. The Magic Tower needed this money. However, he didn’t want to do badly or put his pride down for it.</p>
<p>‘I will make sure to end this fight at once by breaking his nose.’</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>A fire broke out.</p>
<p>The waves of mana that Felix created turned into flames.</p>
<p>“Fire Lance.”</p>
<p>A 3-circle magic with flames in the form of spears.</p>
<p>Powerful flames moved toward Roman Dmitry, and he avoided them with light movements.</p>
<p>This was an intentional attack. His pride didn’t allow him to overwhelm the opponent at the first attack, so he made an attack that the opponent could easily dodge.</p>
<p>“Inferno.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>As the fire grew stronger, it drew in the blazing flames and moved around him, and this attack surrounded him.</p>
<p>The circle was made of fire.</p>
<p>As Roman moved quickly to avoid the flames, Felix manipulated it to follow Roman’s movements.</p>
<p>The flames were moving as if they were living things, and while slowing down Roman’s movements with an attack, he prepared for another.</p>
<p>“Fire Wave.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeeik!</em></p>
<p>Flames exploded. The flames rushed in like waves, wanting to drive Roman into a corner.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>With the short time gap, Roman managed to escape the flames. It was a shocking move.</p>
<p>Roman was able to evade the magic quickly, but even that was anticipated.</p>
<p>‘This is the end.’</p>
<p><em>Memorize.</em></p>
<p>The magic he had prepared in advance rose.</p>
<p>“Rune Flare.”</p>
<p>A 4-circle magic. It was a powerful hit. He was convinced that Roman Dmitry would be defeated by this, as he had no way out.</p>
<p>Actually, he could have used a 5-circle magic, but thinking that Roman might die, he lowered the intensity.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The magic did work. The flames had spread throughout the area, and there was no way for Roman to escape.</p>
<p>This was the end. Even the best aura swordsman wouldn’t be safe with this.</p>
<p>The result of touching his pride. If he had chosen Felix as his opponent, he would have at least been wary of his skills.</p>
<p>But it was then…</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>The flames roared, and emerging from them, Roman Dmitry rushed to Felix.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 154 - Dealing With Magicians (2)</p>
<p>‘What is this?!’</p>
<p>A question popped into his head.</p>
<p>Fire of magic. Even with an aura around him, the heat must have been difficult for his body to adjust to, but Roman Dmitry was rushing to him from the flames.</p>
<p>He couldn’t find an answer, but he had to dodge him now.</p>
<p>“Blink.”</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p><em>Spatial magic.</em></p>
<p>Felix’s body vanished, and he appeared around ten paces away from his original location. But Felix witnessed a shocking scene before he could even adapt to the new environment.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry should have attacked the illusion he had left behind, but he was charging for the real Felix.</p>
<p>In just three steps, he was right in front of him, making Felix grit his teeth.</p>
<p>“Hold.”</p>
<p>He tied his ankles. This will earn him around ten seconds.</p>
<p>Stepping back quickly, Roman released the mana and suppressed his veins at once.</p>
<p>‘This cannot be.’</p>
<p>This was a series of events that deviated from his plan. Roman withstood the flames of a 4-circle fire magic with his body, caught up with Blink, and now released Hold in just three seconds.</p>
<p>He was a monster, and common attacks didn’t work on this monster. He wasn’t sure how Roman was adjusting to this, but he was certain this opponent wasn’t someone he could take on easily.</p>
<p>Roman had a reason for being sure of his victory. Roman Dmitry knew how to deal with magicians, but Felix wasn’t just going to step back.</p>
<p>‘He told me to do my best to get paid 1,000 gold.’</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>His eyes were stained red with the secret skill of the Phoenix Magic Tower.</p>
<p><em>Burning.</em></p>
<p>It was impossible for him to cast it perfectly, but he could imitate half of it.</p>
<p>“Inferno.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>A spark of flame soon spread everywhere, and at the same time, each of the flames showed its own will according to Felix’s control.</p>
<p>The flames seemed to have an ego of their own. Dozens and hundreds of flames rushed for Roman.</p>
<p>It was an ability that went beyond normal flame magic, and Roman couldn’t possibly escape from it.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Roman avoided the attack in front of him with minimal movement. The flames would pass if he turned his head slightly, so he moved to the side to avoid them.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry broke through the front without slowing down. It was as if Roman had anticipated how the attack would come.</p>
<p>Felix was completely overwhelmed by Roman’s movements and how he avoided all the magic attacks. It made no sense.</p>
<p>There were now thousands of flame sparks. Even just one of them was enough to burn the skin, so how was he fine?</p>
<p>‘Damn it!’</p>
<p>Suddenly, the opponent appeared right in front of him. There was no way out, so he used Blink to control the distance this time.</p>
<p>“Blink.”</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>Their space was now close, and his movement was physically impossible to match. The moment his body disappeared, leaving an illusion behind, he moved twenty paces away, and Felix witnessed the devastating reality.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“Ack!?”</p>
<p>An attack that went for his stomach.</p>
<p>Roman followed Blink again and punched Felix in the stomach.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>He fell to his knees, unable to bear the pain, and Roman appeared above him, saying,</p>
<p>“Today’s sparring ends here. I will see you at the same time tomorrow.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Once a day—that was the condition for both of their benefits. Felix, who finished the first day’s schedule, looked up at the sky with a blank face.</p>
<p>‘… how is this possible?’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. The power he showed was beyond common sense. Surely, the Rune Flare he used after driving the opponent to a corner would have been powerful enough to change the outcome of the fight, but Roman rushed through the flames.</p>
<p>And that’s when it happened. Nothing was going as Felix had planned, and the more he fought, the more he felt like he was being caught in Roman’s grip.</p>
<p>And in the end, Roman’s movement to avoid the fire magic was excessive. Even though he had increased the intensity of the flame magic by using Burning, he didn’t seem bothered by it.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry obviously knew how my magic would work. If it weren’t for that, I wouldn’t have been caught after using Blink. As far as what I learned from the academy, there is no miraculous skill to know where the magic would happen. If that is the case, then it must have been because of Roman Dmitry’s prior knowledge.’</p>
<p>And his heart was filled with a lighthearted feeling. He thought a fight with magic and a sword wouldn’t be hard, and if he showed Dmitry his skills, the fight would be over, and he could take the money. So he didn’t expect what had happened today at all.</p>
<p>Even if Roman Dmitry was a great swordsman, Felix was sure that he would not be pushed back, but he was crushed.</p>
<p>Unable to do anything properly, Felix knelt down and spat. It was humiliating. The most humiliating part for him was thinking that Roman Dmitry got the best out of him.</p>
<p>‘If we fight again, will I be able to win?’</p>
<p>More than that, the thought of Roman Dmitry took over his mind. He let his imagination run wild. Roman Dmitry appeared in front of him. He used magic against him, and Roman rushed for him, but he couldn’t land a hit on Roman because of his agile movements.</p>
<p>The study of magic was complex. No matter how powerful one was, it was meaningless if the attack didn’t work, and that was why Felix knew how to drive his opponent into a corner.</p>
<p>But his plan collapsed due to Roman’s magic-piercing evasion ability. He didn’t think his magic could be destroyed, and a method to destroy Roman didn’t even enter his mind.</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p>‘I can never win like this.’</p>
<p>Defeat.</p>
<p>Even in his imagination, he knelt helplessly, but he still continued to trouble himself.</p>
<p>People called Felix poison. When the Magic Tower master went missing, everyone said that the Phoenix Magic Tower was doomed since its main magic was cut, but Felix persisted and trained with what he knew about Burning.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a great achievement. However, the fact that he alone could implement even a part of Burning, which had to pass through a battle and complex methods of implementation, showed how diligent he was.</p>
<p>Three years. A mere successor rose to the power of tower master. People denied Felix, saying he was just some guy aiming for power, and now too.</p>
<p>He felt annoyed with Roman Dmitry’s abilities!</p>
<p>He acknowledges him. From the moment he was defeated by a huge margin, he knew that the man was greater than the rumors, but accepting defeat was a whole different thing.</p>
<p>As he was able to use a part of Burning by implementing thousands of experiments, Felix had no intention of being used as a scarecrow.</p>
<p>‘I will definitely win the next time.’</p>
<p>As he was lost in thought, the sun went down and rose again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day was the second round of sparring. Felix was the same yesterday as today, but he changed his strategy for dealing with Roman.</p>
<p>‘If the opponent can predict my magic and move, then all I have to do is make his predictions meaningless.’</p>
<p>This time Felix attacked first, and he didn’t refuse the favor. Felix raised his mana, and immediately put the plan into action.</p>
<p>“Stone Edge.”</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The rocks on the ground rose up. This was usually used as an offensive spell, but this time, he set them up in coordinates under his feet, which caused Felix to stand on a rising rock.</p>
<p>In an instant, he had an advantageous position, and Roman Dmitry jumped at one rock and tried to attack Felix.</p>
<p>‘As I thought.’</p>
<p>A high position was not an attractive advantage. As long as he didn’t use the 6-circle magic, Fly, he knew he could not move away from Roman’s attack range.</p>
<p>Even so, he didn’t choose a high position for no reason.</p>
<p>“Inferno.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>Sparks rose, but they didn’t attack the opponent. The flames were moving around, and they went beyond the predictable movements.</p>
<p>There was a rain of fire from the sky. How could anyone even manage to attack all the flames that were covering the world?</p>
<p>Even Roman Dmitry wouldn’t be able to stop it.</p>
<p>‘The strength of this magic lies in not aiming it at the enemy.’</p>
<p>Even if the magician attacks at a range of five meters, anyone within ten meters will be swept away by this magic.</p>
<p>Felix planned an indiscriminate flame attack. Even if it wasn’t the best attack, he determined that he had to use it.</p>
<p>“Fire Wave.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>The flames raged, and a force that was not aimed at Roman burned the surroundings, and Felix continued to use magic.</p>
<p>He couldn’t locate Roman Dmitry’s whereabouts. He couldn’t find his figure under the rock because it was engulfed in flames, but he thought that the opponent wouldn’t collapse just from this.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry emerged through the flames.</p>
<p>Seeing his figure floating in the air, Felix used an attack he had prepared in advance.</p>
<p>“Fire Cannon.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>5-circle magic.</p>
<p>This time, there was no way to avoid it.</p>
<p>Fire Cannon was fast and powerful.</p>
<p>Because he was in the air, he had dug a perfect trap to drive Roman into a corner.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The flames of Fire Cannon covered Roman’s body, and that moment…</p>
<p>Felix saw it.</p>
<p>The wall that blocked the flames, the intangible wall.</p>
<p>Felix couldn’t help but be shocked when he saw such a shield.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Aura’s shield. It was a kind of technology he had never heard of in his life. What was certain was that his magic was completely blocked by the shield, and he couldn’t stop Roman because he was too exhausted.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The strong impact made his head snap back, and he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>It hurt.</p>
<p>His face and body were both in pain, and his mind had a single thought.</p>
<p>‘Was it a magic artifact? No. If he had borrowed the power of magic, then I would have noticed the flow of mana right away. Roman Dmitry had no reason to win by doing that. He used aura as a barrier, as well as his own skills.’</p>
<p>He chuckled at this.</p>
<p>What was Roman Dmitry?</p>
<p>He tried to use his head to take down Roman Dmitry, but he couldn’t even touch Roman’s hair. He felt devastated when Roman got close to him and said,</p>
<p>“Felix, it doesn’t matter if I win over you. I have something to gain from fighting you, so a one-sided fight like yesterday and today is not what I want. So don’t do anything like that and try to bring me down. As long as it is magic, feel free to use any method.”</p>
<p>Roman’s words felt humiliating to him.</p>
<p>But Roman didn’t stop.</p>
<p>“If that isn’t enough, call the magicians from the Magic Tower. Even if it’s one against many, I can beat them all. A total of one hundred eighty battles over six months, and if you cannot drive me into a corner even once, I will regret choosing you over the many other magicians.”</p>
<p>At that moment, his eyes were stained with anger. The pain hadn’t even subsided yet, but Roman was doing this.</p>
<p>And right then…</p>
<p>“Just once. If you can win against me, then I will give you 10,000 gold.”</p>
<p>10,000 gold.</p>
<p>At those words, Felix went speechless. He was sure of it now. From the start, Roman Dmitry didn’t consider him his equal.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 155 - Dealing With Magicians (3)</p>
<p>Roman’s words. When he first heard them, he was infuriated.</p>
<p>‘He is looking down on me.’</p>
<p>10,000 gold. That was enough money to feed 40,000 people for a year. Actually, it seemed to imply that he was certain he couldn’t be defeated, and furthermore, he requested that more magicians be summoned because Felix couldn’t seem to handle him.</p>
<p>Roman’s intentions might not have meant that, but his remarks were certainly interpreted negatively, and this alone did not allow Felix to sleep.</p>
<p>Felix was a 5-circle magician. In terms of an aura swordsman, it would be equivalent to a 4-star aura user, but magicians always had the upper hand over the sword. Even if Roman was 5-star, it didn’t make sense for him to lose that easily.</p>
<p>He couldn’t stop thinking about it. In the midst of his bubbling and boiling anger, he looked back on their fights.</p>
<p>‘From now on, it is a matter of my pride. I will make sure that Roman Dmitry kneels down.’</p>
<p>Just in the first week since his arrival, he had a string of defeats.</p>
<p>He had no way to handle Roman as he constantly evaded all the attacks, and he had learned Roman’s movement pattern, so he deliberately attacked him first.</p>
<p>With his heart set on his pride, he decided to use the basics he had learned to plan Roman Dmitry’s defeat.</p>
<p>In the eighth match, he used movement restriction magic. He tied Roman’s feet with compulsive magic such as Slow, but the effect of the magic disappeared, and he couldn’t stop him for long.</p>
<p>It made no sense. In the first fight, Roman shook the effect of Hold, yet he couldn’t understand how he was able to react this quickly.</p>
<p>According to what he learned about magic, he heard an effect could be eliminated by removing mana which seeps into the body. However, it was a difficult method to execute, and Roman Dmitry’s reaction speed exceeded the norm. Thus, his first plan failed.</p>
<p>Five days later, he started the second plan.</p>
<p>This time, he hid in a mist made of magic. But Roman Dmitry still managed to find Felix’s location, even though the information was blocked.</p>
<p>The positions of the sky and the earth felt reversed in this foolish attempt. And with a strong shock to his head, Felix fell to the ground.</p>
<p>A week later, he came up with his third plan, which was to incite Roman to attack.</p>
<p>He had set a magic trap beforehand, and as soon as Roman Dmitry rushed at him, he activated the magic trap and attacked.</p>
<p>But when Roman stepped on the ground, there was a powerful shock that destroyed the trap.</p>
<p>It was great enough that he knew magic traps existed, but he had never heard that they could be destroyed just by stepping on them.</p>
<p>This made him lose his mind. His third plan was crude, but it wasn’t impromptu. He had prepared it a day ahead, but it didn’t even hurt Roman.</p>
<p>Roman was a monster, and he was someone a magician couldn’t touch. Aside from their skill differences, Roman knew how to deal with magicians.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry’s ability is something that cannot be understood with the science of magic. Just where did this monster come from? If Roman harbors a malicious mind towards magicians, then it will be difficult for even a six or a higher circle magician to survive.’</p>
<p>He felt goosebumps rise. Just imagining meeting Roman on the battlefield made him want to admit defeat.</p>
<p>The spars happened each day. It was outrageous. He didn’t use any other means or methods, and in thirty days, he gave up his pride.</p>
<p>His last resort was to take advantage of the chance when he went head-on against Roman. He took advantage of the gaps in Roman’s defense and attempted to finish him with a powerful attack.</p>
<p>The result…</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The aura shield.</p>
<p>His attack was blocked.</p>
<p>Felix, who was looking at the figure of this vague shield, gritted his teeth.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The world spun around.</p>
<p>Felix, pinned to the ground, raised a white flag after a month.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Thirty days.</p>
<p>Thirty fights.</p>
<p>Thirty defeats.</p>
<p>Now he has acknowledged it. Roman Dmitry was a being he couldn’t defeat alone, and Felix took another way.</p>
<p>‘I should not cling to my pride. If I lead the Magic Tower magicians and encounter a monster like Roman on the battlefield, we still wouldn’t win.’</p>
<p>He contacted the tower, and the magicians arrived at Dmitry, and when Felix explained his purpose, it made them frown.</p>
<p>“… you want it to be a one vs. all fight?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Felix. That isn’t right. Magicians generally do not spar or even fight. Magic is the type that controls the area, and that is difficult to do against swordsmen. If done wrong, it can lead to the most threatening and scary accident. And to even go against one man. If we hurt the eldest son of the Dmitry family, what will we do?”</p>
<p>The reaction was negative. One against many was the worst form of fighting. And above all, there was something they didn’t like.</p>
<p>“To be honest, losing thirty defeats in thirty fights is a bit much, right? Mr. Felix, you are now the acting master of our Magic Tower. If so, you need to show some dignity. But you came to this faraway place and showed such a humiliating form.”</p>
<p>It was a magician called Knox.</p>
<p>Immediately after the Magic Tower master vanished, the power system collapsed. Felix was the acting master, but magicians like Knox couldn’t accept the change in the tower and ignored him.</p>
<p>It was hectic to deal with. Even if they had decided to help the Magic Tower, then their bleak future would have been better, but they decided to let the incompetent magician deal with it.</p>
<p>If they weren’t good with magic, shouldn’t they be good at politics?</p>
<p>Felix, who had a more single-minded nature, was a person who wasn’t good as a master despite being the tower master.</p>
<p>Felix said,</p>
<p>“You people are right. No matter what excuse I give, thirty defeats in thirty fights is an unfathomable result. However, for this fight, Roman Dmitry had bet 10,000 gold as a reward. If we work together and take him down, you can use half of that for personal use.”</p>
<p>“… you mean it?”</p>
<p>At that moment, the magicians’ expressions changed. Half of the 10,000 gold—even if they divided the gold into 5,000, there would still be a lot left for other magicians to use.</p>
<p>And they looked at each other. As they looked at each other with greedy eyes, Knox spoke up.</p>
<p>“We just have to win once?”</p>
<p>“It isn’t an easy matter to think about. Roman Dmitry is a person who can be considered a nemesis to magicians, and if we are careless, we will almost certainly lose, so we must have the right plans and…”</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p>His words were cut off.</p>
<p>Knox was a 5-circle magician. He was dissatisfied with Felix for taking the position of master, as he was in his mid-50s.</p>
<p>In the first place, he thought he was a better magician than Felix. Even if he was an opponent Felix couldn’t defeat, having so many magicians to fight against one opponent gave him confidence.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“Mr. Felix, do not worry. We will clean this up for you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, the sparring continued differently than usual.</p>
<p>Felix, Knox, and three other magicians—it was a five vs. one match. Despite being in an overwhelming and unfavorable situation, Roman’s reaction wasn’t different.</p>
<p>“I will give you the first attack.”</p>
<p>“Ha!”</p>
<p><em>Smirk.</em></p>
<p>Knox laughed.</p>
<p>Even if there were five of them together, the magicians had the upper hand, and he wanted to give up the attack advantage?</p>
<p>Was this confidence?</p>
<p>“Those words, do not regret them.”</p>
<p><em>Glance.</em></p>
<p>He gave Roman a glance before the start of the battle for 10,000 gold. They had no reason not to take advantage of the opponent’s carelessness. He raised his mana, and the fight began with Knox taking the lead.</p>
<p>“Fire Lance.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>The moment the strong flames formed in the shape of a spear, the other magicians also moved.</p>
<p>“Fire Wave.”</p>
<p>“Fire Burst.”</p>
<p>Flames exploded everywhere, and they all had no clear plan.</p>
<p>Knox’s plan was to simply hold down Roman Dmitry with the flames, which were already surrounding him.</p>
<p>As more flames gathered around, the fire magic got stronger, and since there were many flames at once and no way out, they were sure that Roman wouldn’t survive. But…</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Through the flames, Roman Dmitry rushed forward.</p>
<p>Felix quickly shouted because he knew it was a pattern that used the Aura Shield.</p>
<p>“Be careful! Fire Wall!”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>He created a wall of fire. It was an ulterior attack to buy time.</p>
<p>Before the flames could even move, Roman took the chance and attacked one magician who was at his side.</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>“Kuak!”</p>
<p>A scream was heard.</p>
<p>And one magician fell to his knees. But while that person was puzzled, another magician attacked Roman.</p>
<p>However, Roman moved too fast.</p>
<p>Roman quickly closed the distance with the other magician and defeated two magicians at once.</p>
<p>“This is insane.”</p>
<p>Knox was taken aback. He expected to end the fight with the first hit. He clenched his fists to draw the flames and used his secret weapon.</p>
<p>“Fire Field.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>A 5-circle fire magic. He controlled the flames that were around and quickly attacked Roman, trying to limit his opponent’s movements. But no matter which direction he chose to attack, Roman Dmitry’s movements never slowed down. It was a disconcerting scene.</p>
<p>In the midst of the flames, Roman quickly evaded the attack and went for another magician.</p>
<p>They weren’t aware that the realm of cold and heat didn’t bother him. Roman couldn’t be affected by these two attributes.</p>
<p><em>Puakl!</em></p>
<p>There were two left.</p>
<p>Knox gritted his teeth and drew mana, but before they could do anything, Roman appeared in front of them.</p>
<p>“Kuak?!”</p>
<p>His speed was beyond normal. And Felix’s warning came to his mind. He had repeatedly told them that Roman Dmitry wasn’t like any other person.</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>Knox stumbled.</p>
<p>His eyes were wide at the powerful impact, and he fell back.</p>
<p>It was a pure and clean victory.</p>
<p>Felix opened his mouth. The fight wasn’t over yet, but he couldn’t attack now.</p>
<p>“… no.”</p>
<p>The truth, which he had previously denied, has now been revealed.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—it was clear that he had never shown his full strength until now.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Phoenix magicians’ minds felt shattered. They came to their senses with swollen faces and looked at the sky, just like Felix did on the first day.</p>
<p>“There is always someone above us.”</p>
<p>“What exactly happened?”</p>
<p>“That was a fight we could never win.”</p>
<p>A crushing defeat. It felt like they had just lost their rationality. Those who were born with talents for magic were always used to being above others, so this helpless loss felt horrible.</p>
<p>Felix was right. Roman Dmitry was a monster beyond common sense who could surely defeat a magician thirty times.</p>
<p>“… Mr. Felix. What the hell have you been fighting all this time?”</p>
<p>It was Knox.</p>
<p>Was this sympathy for him?</p>
<p>When he faced this wall that couldn’t be overcome, he felt an emotional connection to the man who did the same.</p>
<p>A fight of one against many, and their last chance was now gone. Thinking that there was no way to defeat Roman anymore, Felix left the magicians and walked away.</p>
<p>“Wait. I will come after talking with Roman.”</p>
<p>He was curious.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. How did he deal with so many of them? Starting with his evasion to his defense. From start to end, he wanted to look into Roman Dmitry’s mind.</p>
<p>He went to see Roman.</p>
<p>Seeing him spend time alone, Felix felt a bit emotional.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you this straight up. Honestly, I do not have confidence that we can defeat Roman Dmitry. So, can you at least explain how you defeated us so that we can analyze it? In the world I have lived in, no one can avoid magic and break it head-on, as you did. I know this is a difficult thing to take, but please think about the future…”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“Uh?”</p>
<p>“I can’t exactly tell you everything, but I can show you how I prepared for the showdown.”</p>
<p>Roman’s answer was unexpected. He thought that he wouldn’t tell him his secret, but Roman seemed fine with it.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>They moved outside, and after a long walk, they arrived at a two-story building.</p>
<p>“This here.”</p>
<p>“… this is?”</p>
<p>“Let’s head in.”</p>
<p>It was a familiar environment. Just like a Magic Tower, there were numerous books on display inside the building, surrounded by bookshelves.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“The books here are all magic related. It is safe to say that Cairo has all the magic books on the market, from the popular ones to the not-so-popular ones. I stayed here for a while and spent time analyzing magicians.”</p>
<p>At first glance, there appeared to be a thousand books.</p>
<p>His mouth dropped open. At the sight of the books, he knew Roman Dmitry’s victory was not because of luck.</p>
<p>“From now on, I will explain how I dealt with Mr. Felix. Do not accept this as a favor, and when you hear all of it, I hope Mr. Felix has additional advice.”</p>
<p>Roman walked away.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>They were books, and one was titled Understanding Magic. It was a basic magic book, which made Felix confused.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 156 - Dealing With Magicians (4)</p>
<p>Three months ago, Roman had set his goal to analyze magic. From then on, he began to collect all sorts of books on magic and spent time analyzing everything when he had the chance.</p>
<p>Understand magic from the most basic theory. He did, however, read them before proceeding to review the contents.</p>
<p>[Magic starts from resonating the mana from the circle with the mana in nature. Since it is impossible to express magic with mana in the body alone perfectly, the characteristics of mana according to each individual’s inclination is a very important factor. If the mana held in the body is familiar with the fire attribute, then they can draw the power of fire from nature, and it is possible to create synergy when using flame magic.]</p>
<p>Resonating with nature was the root of all magic.</p>
<p>Ordinary magicians studied [Understanding Magic] and tried to find things in mana that suited them.</p>
<p>Fire is fire, water is water, and wind is wind. As stated in the book Understanding of Magic, rather than the opposite attributes, find the right one to learn magic.</p>
<p>When Roman first read the book, he focused on understanding the content. And now, after dealing with Edwin Hector, Roman began to interpret things in a different light.</p>
<p>‘Resonance of nature means that some kind of signal appears in the way magic is used. People often describe magic as some miracle of God creating something from nothing, but as the book Understanding of Magic explains, magic is not a power that appears without conditions. If only I could read that flow, wouldn’t it be possible to figure out the existence of magic in advance and escape from it a step faster?’</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a simple feeling or reaction to mana. It was a pattern, and he wanted to get to the essence of it. Even though it was a basic theory, Roman continued to question it.</p>
<p>‘Magic is a form of well-organized science. Everyone can use the same magic if they can understand it, so magicians established a system of passing down knowledge from generation to generation. In other words, it means that it is possible to use this system. When a magician casts magic, the moment the mana that occurs in circles is connected to the mana of nature, you can predict what kind of magic the opponent will use depending on the form, amount of mana, and attributes of the mana. For example, if it is a display of fire, then it has to be a fireball. If one can figure it out in advance, it’s not difficult to react to it later. A fireball has the power to explode in a straight line. Just moving left or right can help one avoid it.’</p>
<p>He was lost in thought. He imagined he was dodging a fireball.</p>
<p>‘It is difficult to grasp the resonance of mana. So, in order to use this theory, I must consider it to be real and thoroughly understand the magician’s magic as well as the system.’</p>
<p>When he understands his opponent better, he will achieve a perfect victory. So he purchased all of the expensive magic books, as well as bookshelves to store them on, and crammed the vast knowledge into his mind.</p>
<p>Actually, he even checked to see if he had any chance of becoming a magician, but he discovered that the mana circle and dantian could not exist in the same body at the same time. Even if he worked hard, he would not be able to use magic.</p>
<p>With the determination to analyze magic, Roman spent a lot of time studying magicians. In the first month, the analysis was slow. Since the foundation hadn’t been established yet, he was engrossed in understanding magic.</p>
<p>And then, time went on, and he slowly picked up the pace. As the books continued to fill the shelves, Roman began to understand magic little by little. When three months had passed, Roman Dmitry realized that he needed to apply what he had learned in real combat.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“The reason I was able to react quickly to Mr. Felix’s magic is that I managed to read a pattern. I figured out in advance what kind of magic you would use according to the amount, form, and attribute of mana and chose to respond according to it. Whether you would use flames, waves, runes, or anything else. When a magician decides to use a specific magic, it isn’t difficult to predict its purpose based on what kind of magic it is.”</p>
<p>Roman’s first words frightened Felix. Roman said it was nothing special, but putting the theory into practice was much tougher than he thought.</p>
<p>Firstly,</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The sense of reading the resonance of mana.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The knowledge of knowing the type of magic just by looking at the resonance form.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Quick judgment based on the information.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>These were the three conditions needed.</p>
<p>Felix was shocked, but Roman continued.</p>
<p>“The destruction type magic such as Hold is a kind of offset. As far as anyone in the Magic World knows, curse-like spells can be lifted when the mana seeps into the body. However, this method is time-consuming. On the battlefield, where every second counts, that wouldn’t be a good solution. That is why I chose to use the mana inside my body to create an external mana and explosion. So it exploded in my body. Even the slightest mistake or range and strength of the blast will take a toll on the body, but if properly used, it can neutralize the magic.”</p>
<p>This also made no sense.</p>
<p>Felix asked him three questions: How could Roman react a step faster? Why didn’t the curse magic work? What was the shield that blocked the magic?</p>
<p>And Roman gave him a clear answer.</p>
<p>However, while Felix was listening intently, he knew that not everyone could actually do this.</p>
<p>“And the third is the shield that blocks magic. It is formed like a shield by displaying the aura outside. I refer to this as a Sword Shield. It is a way to block the opponent’s attack by using the powerful force of aura as a defense.”</p>
<p>Sword Shield. It was a Murim method. Unlike how this world uses aura as an explosive force, the Sword Shield needed meticulous control to use the aura outside the body. If a normal swordsman tried to attack Roman, the unstable aura would blow up instead of taking the shock.</p>
<p>Roman brought up the basic concept of magic, and Felix expressed his doubts about Roman’s magic theory. However, after hearing his detailed explanation, Felix realized why he had lost.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Roman closed the book, and…..</p>
<p>“My explanation ends here. Is there anything else you want to know?”</p>
<p>He asked.</p>
<p>In order to supplement his own knowledge, he didn’t hesitate to impart it to others.</p>
<p>This was confidence.</p>
<p>And looking up at Roman, he said,</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>Felix couldn’t think of anything more to say.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The discussion ended, and Felix returned to where he was staying. It was just a short time, but the conversation with Roman made him feel bad.</p>
<p>“What did I just hear?”</p>
<p>People called Felix a genius. Until now, he had thought of himself as gifted, but Roman Dmitry felt like a completely different being.</p>
<p>Monster. He couldn’t express it in words. Roman explained how he dealt with the magicians one by one, but it seemed like the world of common sense was collapsing.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. He isn’t someone who simply follows his instincts. He thoroughly analyzed the opponent and won dozens of victories against me using perfect calculations. It must have been the same thing with the 10,000 gold reward. Roman Dmitry was confident enough to win that he deliberately drove himself into a corner.’</p>
<p>This wasn’t a general judgment. No matter how confident he was, in the face of a reward, he asked Roman Dmitry to help clear out the doubt about what Roman wanted to do and the knowledge he had. To prove it, they had gone against each other. And he was bold enough not to hide this method since no one else could use it.</p>
<p>‘Can I do that?’</p>
<p>No. He could never do that. Even if he couldn’t use the knowledge with his own strength, it was clear that he would have thought about the benefits he would have from keeping such knowledge to himself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that he was ashamed of everything that happened. Knowing that most people would make the same choice as him for the reward made Roman seem more unusual.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he remembered one conversation with Roman.</p>
<p>“Felix, it doesn’t matter if I win over you. I have something to gain from fighting you, so a one-sided fight like yesterday and today is not what I want. So don’t do anything like that and try to bring me down. As long as it is magic, feel free to use any method.”</p>
<p>Those were Roman’s words. He was consistent from start to finish. He didn’t care at all about showing his true self, power, or knowledge, and he hoped to gain something from fighting with him.</p>
<p>In the process, he was even willing to spend money and give up his knowledge. As long as he could take a step forward, he did not care about who was following him.</p>
<p>It was amazing because it was something Felix could never do. And for the first time in his life, Felix felt that his existence was insignificant.</p>
<p>‘Even a strong man like Roman Dmitry works hard to improve his strength, and what am I doing? Since Teacher vanished, I have constantly avoided the reality ahead of me, saying I couldn’t help it. The same went when it came to choosing Dmitry. If I really had the will to do something, I would have tried to improve myself instead of coming here to make money.’</p>
<p>Consequently, he met Roman and gained enlightenment. However, if he had made the right decision, he wouldn’t have chosen Dmitry, who offered him a certain amount.</p>
<p>At this moment, Felix forgot about the deal. Aside from the huge reward, he hoped to accomplish something like Roman.</p>
<p>‘For the rest of my time here, I will do my best against Roman Dmitry. I hope that Roman Dmitry will gain something from this, and I hope to gain something as well. I will spend time developing myself and not just devote myself to the money.’</p>
<p>There are many types of human beings in the world. Some people despair when they hit a wall, but some use it to develop themselves, and Felix belongs to the latter.</p>
<p>And from then on, win or lose, Felix began to immerse himself in the new reality.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time passed. Even though he had a different mindset than before, Felix fought dozens of times but never won.</p>
<p>A one-sided defeat. Felix always tried to defeat Roman, but Roman could predict his moves, so he won every time. But all those fights weren’t meaningless because Felix was a good test subject. And Roman’s response time had increased as a result of this accumulated experience.</p>
<p>Soon, two months had gone by since he got there, and Felix, who was away from Frank, realized how strange Dmitry was.</p>
<p>‘Dmitry is a Baron family on the outskirts, but the military power it holds is greater than others.’</p>
<p>The guards at the gates. He thought they were well-trained at first, but when he saw Roman’s men, he completely changed his opinion.</p>
<p>There were hundreds of them. Even ordinary soldiers showed such extreme power that they could be called knights.</p>
<p>Moreover, their blind loyalty. Occasionally, he had some chances to watch them train, and their aspirations felt so strong. It was no different with Dmitry’s men.</p>
<p>The people would split to the sides to bow to Roman whenever they noticed him. Even though Roman was obviously not the Lord of Dmitry yet, he held such an overwhelming position.</p>
<p>It was certain. He was a ruler. Roman Dmitry was already accustomed to ruling over others. Roman’s attitude of not looking back and accepting people’s loyalty aroused a strange feeling inside Felix.</p>
<p>Felix’s teacher. In his absence, the Magic Tower began to shake. If Phoenix had someone like Roman as the leader, it might have been better.</p>
<p>And one day, Felix heard shocking words from the Master Blacksmith’s craftsman.</p>
<p>“…..Young Master Roman visits the smithy often? Even though he occasionally shows his face to the people around here, I heard that he uses the private forge to make his own swords. Actually, that is what I heard from the Master Blacksmith. People say that Young Master Roman is like a Fire God because when he works there, the flames in the furnace wrap around his body.”</p>
<p>It was just a casual conversation. But hearing that the flames would engulf his body while working, Felix couldn’t simply ignore it.</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>His heart raced. The ability to handle fire. If those words were true and not an exaggeration, then this was the answer Felix was seeking.</p>
<p>The secret of Phoenix—in order to perfectly cast Burning, the ability to accept fire was required.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 157 - Dealing With Magicians (5)</p>
<p>Felix thought back to his past. Even though he was never directly taught how to manifest Burning, he had heard some fragments about it from his teacher.</p>
<p>“Burning is not the kind of skill that can be mastered in a day or two. First of all, the affinity with fire has to be extremely high. It cannot be taught just because someone wants to learn it. Disciple, if you really want to follow in my footsteps, then become closer to fire with each passing day and fully embrace it. If you no longer feel pain even with fire wrapped around your body, then you can be reborn as the Flame God.”</p>
<p>The Phoenix Magic Tower. They were weak despite having such a secret technique because there was no clear method for passing on the knowledge they possessed.</p>
<p>The former Magic Tower masters. They all embraced the flames in their own manner, and Felix’s teacher also acquired an overwhelming affinity with fire as a result of being an arson victim when he was a child. But the experience he went through wasn’t what everyone should go through.</p>
<p>There were even disciples who deliberately tried to burn their bodies, hoping to attain some realization, but they either lost their lives or some of their body parts. After all, Burning was something only the talented could learn, and he had no choice but to pray that the flame would accept him.</p>
<p>But Roman Dmitry was engulfed in flames in the forge. If this was true, it was safe to say that he had an overwhelming affinity with fire, which was the basic condition for Burning.</p>
<p>‘Even when he sparred with me, Roman’s reaction was definitely not a normal one. Aside from having no fear of the flames, it was like the heat didn’t even matter to him. Didn’t Roman Dmitry just recently learn how to accept the flames and analyze magic? The Dmitry family, who have been familiar with the flames of a forge for generations might have some secrets.’</p>
<p>That might not be true. Even so, he couldn’t hold back his inflated hope.</p>
<p>Burning—it was the source of the Phoenix Magic Tower’s power. People acknowledged the value of Phoenix when Burning existed with the Magic Tower, and now that they have lost access to their main skill, their Magic Tower is considered useless.</p>
<p>This was why Burning was needed. Magicians who mastered Burning were called disasters on the battlefield, so the fact that the only person who knew it went missing really shook up the Phoenix Magic Tower.</p>
<p>In the future, in order for the Magic Tower to survive, and as the person who inherited the tower, he had to manifest Burning.</p>
<p>After talking with the blacksmith, he went straight to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He met up with Roman. He saw his face every day, but the thought of getting a clue about Burning made his heart beat hard today. And Felix said,</p>
<p>“… according to the blacksmith, when Mr. Roman Dmitry worked in the forge, you were known to be surrounded by flames on your bare body. Are you protecting your body with mana, or do you have a special way to accept the fire?”</p>
<p>He couldn’t ask about his doubts right away, but he guessed that the answer would be either of the two. If it was the former, then he didn’t have to talk further, and if it was the latter, the future of the tower depended on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman looked at Felix. Even though he didn’t reveal his intention for asking, he understood why.</p>
<p>“The rumors that you have been looking for a way to embrace the fire must be true. If you are asking if what I displayed within the forge is some innate thing, then no. I am no different from any other person. I feel the same heat from the fire, but I managed to solve it in my own manner.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, his heart sank. When Roman gave a clear answer, his mouth dried up and his hands turned sweaty.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. He knows what I want.’</p>
<p>Actually, there was no need to hide it. It was a known fact that the Phoenix Magic Tower was looking for a way to embrace fire, but no one could provide it.</p>
<p>It was a natural result. Forcibly raising the affinity for fire wasn’t something humans could solve. It was a realm of the Gods, so he hoped that a miracle would happen when he approached the fire.</p>
<p>If Roman could give him an answer, Felix was ready to do anything for Roman.</p>
<p>‘The reason why our Magic Tower is undervalued is that there is no clear system for passing down our secret techniques. I have no choice but to wait for the fire to come and embrace me, and if the transfer of knowledge about Burning disappears like what is happening now, then the Magic Tower is done for. However, if we can find a way to meet the basic conditions, then the Magic Tower’s situation would be completely different.’</p>
<p>Creating a system would help change their situation. Starting with Felix, it was only a matter of time before the entire tower gained stability if they could pass on Burning.</p>
<p>“Phew.”</p>
<p>He let out a deep sigh, his hands and feet shaking. Felix didn’t bother hiding his nervous expression as he cautiously said,</p>
<p>“I will speak honestly to you. The Phoenix Magic Tower needs the skill that Roman Dmitry has. Please give us the conditions. We will make sure to get them done.”</p>
<p>He had hope. The past three years have been a nightmare. After passing through a time of pain, he finally saw a string of hope. But…</p>
<p>“It isn’t that difficult for me to teach you. But I have no reason to do such a favor for you.”</p>
<p>They met every day for two months, so he might have mistaken Roman Dmitry for a kind person. Felix and Roman Dmitry were like two opposite sides of a coin.</p>
<p>He thought that their relationship would strengthen with time, but they never had a conversation that was different from their initial purpose for meeting.</p>
<p>And that was all. Roman openly said he learned so he could fight better, and he had no intention of spreading his own knowledge indiscriminately. This meant Roman wanted a solid relationship.</p>
<p>Now that Felix has revealed his desire, this was a weakness he could hold on to.</p>
<p>‘This.’</p>
<p>Felix’s expression hardened. The ability to embrace fire—a technique that the Magic Tower desperately needed. The moment Roman Dmitry drew the line, the Phoenix Magic Tower lost everything.</p>
<p>But Roman hoped to use this as a compromise and offer it when his opponent was desperate for growth.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“Dmitry has everything. We are financially rich enough to bet on 10,000 gold as a reward for sparring, but we don’t need anything from the Magic Tower. So think about it and tell me. As for the Phoenix Magic Tower, how far will you go for that one thing?”</p>
<p>A blunt question. The development of this conversation was different from what he had expected, and Felix could no longer control his expression.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The answer was delayed. He needed time to think, so he called for the other magicians. After explaining what happened with Roman, Knox stepped forward to represent the magicians.</p>
<p>“I will tell you my honest opinion. A month in the Dmitry estate—this was something I failed to understand when you called us over, but staying in this place showed me that the estate differs greatly from the rumors. It has an unbelievably perfect system for an estate on the outskirts, and people here show blind trust toward Roman Dmitry. To be honest, I feel jealous. After the tower master went missing, the magicians of Phoenix couldn’t find peace even for a moment, but here, the people of Dmitry seem so happy.”</p>
<p>Felix felt it, and so did the other magicians. As they got along with the people of Dmitry, they could feel how ideal this land was. Was that why? No one said anything at the start, but now they leaned towards Dmitry.</p>
<p>“We have had several sparring matches with Roman Dmitry over the past month or so, and we haven’t won a single one. At first, I thought we were being careless, but no matter how tactical our approach was, we couldn’t come up with a method to defeat Roman Dmitry. He is a nemesis to us magicians. Just the thought of encountering someone like him in a real battle makes me want to run away.”</p>
<p>Being defeated by Roman. It wasn’t just Felix. But all the magicians had no choice but to face repeated defeat against Roman. It was accurate to call him a heavenly being. At least for magicians, the man was an existence they hated to fight against.</p>
<p>“Why don’t we say this? If we cannot win, we join them instead. Now that the Frank Kingdom has treated us differently since our fall, I think it wouldn’t be a bad idea to dedicate our tower to Roman Dmitry to keep Burning alive. And honestly, didn’t Mr. Felix come here only to get our consent?”</p>
<p>“… was I that obvious?”</p>
<p>“I have good eyes. And if you didn’t think it would work, you wouldn’t have asked us in the first place.”</p>
<p>Knox’s words made the other magicians nod. Felix gulped when everyone shared their thoughts.</p>
<p>‘The Dmitry family.’</p>
<p>The thirteen Magic Towers. They all had their own nations and families that they were siding with. Since magicians were still limited, there has never been a case where a tower would form a relationship with a noble family and not the nation.</p>
<p>And now Phoenix was trying to escape from the old tradition. He felt attracted to the Dmitry family and not to the Cairo Kingdom.</p>
<p>So he closed his eyes. The existence of Burning was the most important thing for them. And if they swore allegiance to someone in return for it, like Roman Dmitry, it didn’t seem like a bad option.</p>
<p>Finally…</p>
<p>“I understand. From now on, we will entrust the future of the Phoenix Magic Tower to Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>As the acting master of the tower, Felix made the decision.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On that day, Felix brought the magicians and swore allegiance. There were dozens of magicians. Even when they swore allegiance in unison, Roman had a calm face. Being a magician wasn’t a great thing for Roman. This was like accepting Chris or Kevin.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>‘This is the ideal situation I can think of.’</p>
<p>Roman deliberately chose this Magic Tower for three reasons.</p>
<p>First. When he was in need of a sparring opponent, Felix was the best option, according to the information he found through the intelligence guild. Felix would choose to come to Dmitry for money, but he had the zeal to find a way to win the same battles.</p>
<p>Second. Felix specialized in offensive magic. This meant that he wasn’t just a cost-efficient choice. Through constant sparring with Felix, he was determined to gain something.</p>
<p>Third. He was uncertain about this part, but according to the rumors, the Magic Tower needed the ability to accept fire in order to manifest Burning, and Roman’s flame arts were perfect for it. He wasn’t sure what this would do. But if Phoenix needed that, it was really the only last piece of the puzzle that could solve the problem, and Roman knew that he would benefit from it.</p>
<p>With just one choice, there were three benefits. And the fact that the Phoenix magicians had come to Roman would cause great havoc in the Cairo Kingdom.</p>
<p>‘There isn’t much time left. Here in Dmitry, far from the capital, I will build a fort step by step and wipe out the power system of Cairo at once.’</p>
<p>As he was lost in thought for the future, Roman began to lay out another step-by-step plan.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, the migration of the Magic Tower went smoothly. First, they kept the fact that they were following Dmitry a secret and moved their luggage one by one.</p>
<p>‘I hope my choice isn’t wrong.’</p>
<p>After sparring, he decided to learn the Infernal Divine Arts. He wasn’t sure if that could be the clue to Burning, but he still had to learn it.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry placed no other conditions on Phoenix. He even assisted them in moving to Dmitry for the sole purpose of their sworn alliance.</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p>“Magic Tower master!”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>A magician of the Phoenix Magic Tower.</p>
<p>He didn’t have a high-ranking position, but he was in charge of doing chores.</p>
<p>He handed over some documents with a red face.</p>
<p>“Look at this! This is the budget that Dmitry has given us.”</p>
<p>“… budget?”</p>
<p>Felix still didn’t know what kind of person Roman was. To follow Roman Dmitry and what it meant….</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 158 - Two Way (1)</p>
<p>Felix opened and closed his eyes. After checking the contents of the given budget several times, he couldn’t hide his shocked expression.</p>
<p>“… is he willing to support us this much?”</p>
<p>“I doubted my eyes at first, too. Since the amount was much higher than our initial estimate, we went back to the person who allotted it and asked again. But they said nothing was wrong with this. Rather, if they think that the operation cost of a Magic Tower is not enough, they could organize a budget and make a new offer to us.”</p>
<p>This made his eyes tremble. A monthly budget of 2,000 gold was stated in the document, with an annual budget of 24,000 gold. It was a huge amount. According to the contents of the document, eight thousand people would be provided with enough money each month to live for a year.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t just accept this unrealistic amount. People called magicians money-eating monsters. Unlike aura swordsmen, who grew through physical training, magicians needed a large number of expensive items, such as books and mana stones, to rise to higher circles.</p>
<p>According to public knowledge, it was said that at least 5,000 gold was required in the process of becoming a 3rd-circle magician. That was to say, as the circle of a magician rose, the money required would also increase exponentially.</p>
<p>So, despite being a neutral force, the Magic Towers developed friendly relationships with nations. Their basic operating expenses were supported by the forces at a national level, and in return, it was a way to strengthen them in case they needed help.</p>
<p>Actually, at first, noble families also showed signs of accepting the Magic Towers. However, regardless of how wealthy a noble family was, monthly operating expenses were not easily granted, and it was impossible to extend their relationship unless they received something in return.</p>
<p>Because of this, most nations end up cutting off their ties with the Magic Towers. As a result, the fastest-growing Magic Towers became national treasures, and the Kronos Empire demonstrated how powerful a nation could be by maintaining seven Magic Towers.</p>
<p>‘… I was prepared to have a small budget.’</p>
<p>When he left Frank, he didn’t expect much support from Dmitry. Even though Dmitry was said to be the richest family in Cairo, supporting them with thousands of gold each month was too much.</p>
<p>What the Phoenix Tower wanted was the ability to embrace fire. With that alone, they thought Dmitry was doing them a favor, and for the time being, they only wanted to stay in Dmitry and rise to the top.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Tower was fine with just 1,000 gold a month because of the small number of people it had, and large-scale towers received more than 10,000 gold a month.</p>
<p>But Roman was giving them 2,000 gold a month?</p>
<p>At that moment, a plan to sell more magic items in the future seemed like a good idea.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. He didn’t accept us without reason. He must have decided that he could handle us enough, and careful consideration was done before taking Phoenix into Dmitry. 2,000 gold per month is enough to run a normal Magic Tower.’</p>
<p>Felix didn’t know the truth. After Dmitry’s mining changes, Dmitry literally possessed most of the money in Cairo. Unofficially, they were the richest in Cairo, and the wealth they possessed wasn’t something a baron family could have.</p>
<p>In addition, they recently formed an alliance with Marquis Valentino. He wasn’t a man of lies, and he sent tons of money to Dmitry while saying that the more money Dmitry had, the better.</p>
<p>2,000 gold per month? It was just a small amount. Dmitry was rapidly growing while remaining hidden from the public eye.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p>“… tower master. I think you should come and see this.”</p>
<p>The support of the Dmitry family wasn’t just limited to money.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Pointing to a large land, Chris said,</p>
<p>“We plan to initiate the construction process in a week. And as you can see from the blueprints, this has been designed to handle at least one thousand people, with the hope that the tower will expand its power in the future. And basically, we secured some land in advance to place the needed facilities for the Magic Tower. We completed the blueprint after doing research on our side, so if you feel like anything is lacking, please inform us.”</p>
<p>“… it is enough for now. No, this is too much.”</p>
<p>Felix looked around at the vast land. Phoenix was going to have a home here? It felt like he would faint in the middle of the day.</p>
<p>The Frank Kingdom. For the sake of attracting Phoenix, many of their promises were broken. At first, they decided to build a Magic Tower comparable to the one in the Empire, but they disputed everything and said a Magic Tower didn’t need that much and built a regular one. But what they couldn’t do as a kingdom was provided by Dmitry—a noble family.</p>
<p>Chris held the blueprint. With just one quick glance at the contents, he could see how much effort the people had put into this design.</p>
<p>“Actually, I am a little confused right now. The Lord surely promised to support us fully, but we didn’t expect him to extend so much support. To be honest, this is far beyond the capabilities of a noble family. So why is Dmitry doing this?’</p>
<p>He was genuinely curious. A huge budget and the construction of a Magic Tower—it was perfect. He chose Dmitry without expecting anything huge in return, but this place felt like Utopia.</p>
<p>Chris said,</p>
<p>“From what I have seen, there is no particular reason for the Lord’s favor to you. Before Mr. Felix, all those who swore allegiance to our Lord experienced the same thing. With the help of the Lord, I made progress as a swordsman, and Kevin’s family managed to get away from the slums and live in the city, and everyone else who followed our Lord is receiving something good for their work.”</p>
<p>And not a single subordinate of Roman found it strange to receive these things. They didn’t care once the Phoenix Magic Tower came under their Lord.</p>
<p>Felix was at a loss for words.</p>
<p>And Chris looked at him.</p>
<p>“You will get used to it in the future. Just for the sole reason that you swore allegiance, our Lord is the type who values his people more than anyone else, and in the future, we will live for such a person.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Around the same time, Hans had a busy morning.</p>
<p>“Young Master Roman’s routine shouldn’t be off even by a little bit when I am gone. Young Master Roman always trains with the sword for about an hour after finishing his morning work, so you need to bring a towel and some lukewarm water for him to wipe off his sweat. After guiding him to his meal, you need to organize his schedule and inform Young Master Roman about what he needs to take care of. And after that…”</p>
<p>There was no end to Hans’s explanation. Hans’s successor, a servant named Murphy, was eagerly noting all of this down.</p>
<p>Actually, Hans didn’t want to bring in a successor for his work, but Roman’s workload had increased so much that he knew he alone couldn’t handle it. So he put his heart and soul into selecting a new one.</p>
<p>Many wanted to serve Roman, and Murphy was the one he chose over a thousand candidates. He was a brilliant graduate of the Adelian Academy. Murphy was an elite in his own right, but normally, people wouldn’t want a rookie to work for them.</p>
<p>‘Why are there so many or’s in the schedule!?’</p>
<p>Hans’s work, from morning to night, was all for the sake of Roman Dmitry. Normally, he would have followed Hans and watched him work, but today was the day Hans had something important to do.</p>
<p>The child of Hans’s only son—Hans’s granddaughter and Harrison’s daughter—was going to celebrate her birthday.</p>
<p>Hans had planned to finish all the work for Roman and then visit his son, but Roman told him to take an early leave. Roman had actually asked Hans to leave the day before, but Hans had been stubborn in not abandoning his work the day before.</p>
<p>After passing on the work to Murphy, Hans prepared his things and began to head out.</p>
<p>‘My pretty granddaughter should like dolls.’</p>
<p>He was excited. Harrison lived in Adelian and not in Dmitry. With the support of Hans, he graduated from the academy and soon turned into an adult, settled there, and started his own business.</p>
<p>And after ten years, Harrison became the head of a company that supplied food ingredients. It wasn’t a large enterprise, but it was well-known in Adelian.</p>
<p>And it was the birthday of the only granddaughter of such a son. A treasure he would never want to see hurt.</p>
<p>Hans made his way to the mansion’s gate, intending to travel quickly in the wagon he had rented.</p>
<p>But…</p>
<p>“I was waiting.”</p>
<p>“Hans. Get into the wagon.”</p>
<p>In front of the gate was a different scene. The wagon that Hans rented was a cheap one, but the wagon in front of him now was dazzlingly bright. And Dmitry’s soldiers were waiting there.</p>
<p>Hans, who initially thought it had nothing to do with him, looked around and was puzzled when he couldn’t see his wagon.</p>
<p>“… were you waiting to pick me up in this?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is Young Master Roman’s order.”</p>
<p>Stubborn Hans. Roman had prepared a gift for him when he finished his work.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just like Hans, Harrison also had a busy day.</p>
<p>‘I will finish all the deliveries by morning, so I can attend my daughter’s party at lunch.’</p>
<p>Even if it was his daughter’s birthday, he couldn’t take a leave. Harrison organized the food ingredients that had to be delivered in the morning and then quickly delivered them to the customers through his employees.</p>
<p>And one of them was the important trading task. Arriving at the mansion of Count Adelian, he called out cautiously,</p>
<p>“We have brought the ingredients.”</p>
<p>Jordin—Adelian’s manager and butler—was a picky person. He would always point out if the quality was even slightly off.</p>
<p>Perhaps that was why, when delivering here, Harrison’s expression was never calm. He knew that if Jordin wasn’t satisfied with the ingredients, doing business with Count Adelian would be tough, so even if this brought in a little loss, he would always bring the finest ingredients he had.</p>
<p>But Jordin’s reaction was odd.</p>
<p>“It is your daughter’s birthday today, right? You must be busy, so leave them and go quickly.”</p>
<p>“…what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You man. You have been working since dawn to celebrate your only daughter’s birthday. I, Jordin, am not one to hold you here today. Leave the food ingredients there. I will take care of them, so do not worry and go so you can finish the other tasks you need to do.”</p>
<p>He was flustered. Jordin wasn’t that kind of man. He couldn’t accept this as a favor and thought there was some ulterior motive behind this.</p>
<p>‘Is he going to change their supplier?’</p>
<p>He was sure that if he left the things here, even if Jordin himself told Harrison to leave, he would hold him accountable for neglect.</p>
<p>“No. I will bring them inside right now.”</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>“I have to do this work. I cannot pass this on to Mr. Jordin.”</p>
<p>He didn’t care and called his men to help move the food ingredients inside. Jordin was shocked. Realizing Harrison wasn’t listening to him, he called the family servants.</p>
<p>“Call the servants right now! Help Harrison move the food inside! We have to finish this work as soon as possible so he can return to his daughter’s arms! Hurry up and help the man!’</p>
<p>This was so strange. Nothing Jordin said or did felt bad. So Harrison was able to finish the job early with the help of the servants.</p>
<p>‘… what is this?’</p>
<p>When he finished the work, Harrison couldn’t hold back his shock. Jordin wasn’t the type to offer help, and no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t figure out what was happening.</p>
<p>But what could he do? The work was done, and he could finally head home to his daughter. It was time to meet his precious treasure.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was time for the party. It was going to be held in a modest place. He planned on inviting people to celebrate his daughter’s birthday and open some presents.</p>
<p>That was the plan this morning, but it changed a little as soon as he got home.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>He dropped the present he had prepared for his daughter.</p>
<p>A large outdoor party area was set up in front of his house. There was a lot of food on the table, including some he hadn’t seen before. There were even people he didn’t remember meeting before who carried food to the party.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. On the other side, there was a stage with classical music. A series of scenes he’d never seen before was unfolding in front of him.</p>
<p>“… what the hell happened?”</p>
<p>No matter how much he thought about it, something felt horribly wrong.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 159 - Two Way (2)</p>
<p>Harrison approached his wife and asked,</p>
<p>“What is all of this?’</p>
<p>“Honey!”</p>
<p>His wife looked delighted. She stopped what she was doing and glanced to the side.</p>
<p>“I was preparing for our child’s birthday in the morning, and then the man right there, that one, led the people here. I didn’t even know what he was doing, but then he said that they were all sent by Roman Dmitry, and then everything turned into a mess as they were preparing the party before I knew it.”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry’s people?”</p>
<p>He looked at where his wife was watching. One man was leading the people. Roman was the name of the man his father served, but he still couldn’t understand what was happening.</p>
<p>‘Why would Young Master Roman send some people?’</p>
<p>It was his daughter’s birthday. Harrison approached the man, curious as to why they were there.</p>
<p>“… excuse me, did Young Master Roman send you?”</p>
<p>“Ah!? Mr. Harrison?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I am Harrison. So, may I ask, why are you organizing the party for my daughter?”</p>
<p>He was being cautious, just like when dealing with the Adelian family. Being with the Dmitry family made him wary.</p>
<p>And the man said,</p>
<p>“I am Lucas, and I serve Young Master Roman. You don’t have to be that cautious with me. It isn’t like there are any special reasons, but Young Master Roman sent me and the others to repay the services that Mr. Hans provided. So why don’t you leave the party arrangements to us? This party isn’t just a celebration for your daughter, but it will be of great help to Mr. Harrison as you continue to live in the Adelian estate.”</p>
<p>“… I do not understand. This doesn’t seem like a normal situation.”</p>
<p>Roman and Hans. Their relationship was that of a noble and a servant. Even after hearing this long explanation, Harrison couldn’t accept this, as nobles never cared for their servants.</p>
<p>“I fully understand what you are feeling. It is just a simple matter. Young Master Roman, my Lord, values Mr. Hans very much. Maybe this is a feeling that has accumulated for a long time. That’s why he didn’t send us in the hopes of receiving something in return. He has planned this event purely with the intention of celebrating your daughter’s birthday. Haven’t you heard about the Lord from your father? Mr. Hans is a man who deserves this kind of treatment.”</p>
<p>He was bewildered. Someone worthy? The words stuck in his head, and Harrison felt strange.</p>
<p>‘To think Roman Dmitry values my father.’</p>
<p>This was unexpected. People have been talking about how Roman Dmitry has changed recently, but Hans’s son, Harrison, couldn’t forget how insane that man was.</p>
<p>The trash. Harrison’s friends would often tease Hans for serving such a madman. Harrison, who had a good childhood under his father’s care, didn’t like to see his father following Roman. He remembered how Roman Dmitry was often drunk and screaming, and how his father looked exhausted.</p>
<p>So he wanted to succeed, and after graduating from the academy and starting his own business, his life changed. The man who was called the son of a servant was now a boss.</p>
<p>It was still the same. He still had to bow down to others, but right now, it felt like he had managed to escape his past.</p>
<p>And now he is favored by Roman. But not a single good memory would pop up in his mind.</p>
<p>‘The days when Roman Dmitry was called an idiot. My father said that he was just a bit different because he went through something he couldn’t handle and that he was a good child at heart. I denied it and called Roman Dmitry an ungrateful man, and I thought my father’s efforts were all meaningless no matter how much the man’s behavior changed. But now, Roman Dmitry sent people for the sake of my father.’</p>
<p>He felt like crying. His father’s efforts weren’t in vain. The fact that Roman Dmitry directly expressed his gratitude made Harrison smile.</p>
<p>“… saying we deserve to be treated like this. Such good words.”</p>
<p>A good child at heart, he was now taking his father’s words seriously.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Harrison allowed the party to be arranged by the others. Lucas told him to leave everything in his hands, and at his command, people were organizing and preparing the party.</p>
<p>There was still a little time left before the party. However, the guests arrived earlier than the scheduled time.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>“What the hell is this?!”</p>
<p>“Did we come to the right place?”</p>
<p>The guests were shocked. An outdoor party? They all looked around, surprised and intrigued by this party, which looked like it was hosted by a noble family. If they didn’t see Harrison, they would have thought that they were in the wrong place.</p>
<p>Harrison explained the situation. He didn’t know until this morning that Roman Dmitry had sent someone to prepare everything. And at those words, everyone looked at each other. Anyone who lived a good social life would know what it meant.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry sent people for the sake of Harrison’s father?’</p>
<p>‘Since when did they have such a strong nobleman behind them? Damn it. If I had known it would be like this, I would have prepared a nice present for his daughter. No, why is their close relationship with Roman Dmitry only revealed now?’</p>
<p>They once heard from Harrison about his relationship with Roman. So they didn’t think they had a good relationship, but if Roman arranged a party for his daughter, then things seemed different.</p>
<p>“… I am going to go somewhere for a while.”</p>
<p>“I left the present back home.”</p>
<p>The guests slowly turned away. They needed a gift. Now that it’s been revealed that Harrison had such connections, his position isn’t as common as it used to be.</p>
<p>There was an uproar. Guests arrived one after another, and all of them were shocked. Since they were all commoners, Roman’s involvement at the party was shocking.</p>
<p>And it was almost time. By the time the preparations for the party ended, everyone’s eyes were focused on one place.</p>
<p><em>Chak!</em></p>
<p>The sound of steady steps. The soldiers of the Adelian family approached the party. And if only it were just them, Harrison wouldn’t be so shocked.</p>
<p>“… Father?!”</p>
<p>Right in the center was Hans. Harrison’s father was being escorted by the soldiers of Adelian.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hans rode the wagon and arrived at the Adelian estate. He thought he was treated too well for a man traveling alone, but as soon as he arrived, the guards of Adelian welcomed him.</p>
<p>“We were waiting for you!”</p>
<p>The guard captain. He had received a special order from the Count—escort Hans to where he needed to go. Even though it wasn’t Roman’s request, Count Adelian sent some people.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to do this much.”</p>
<p>Hans naturally refused. It was his granddaughter’s party. She was the main character for today, and he had no intention of stealing the spotlight. But….</p>
<p>“Please, please know that if we don’t escort you, sir, our Count will be angry. We do not ask for much. Just let us lead the way until we get you to the party.”</p>
<p>The captain asked him with a desperate face. Was it sympathy? Knowing what it meant to follow an order, Hans couldn’t turn him down, so he arrived at the party with them.</p>
<p>As surprised as the guests were, Hans was also at a loss for words at the party.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The sight in front of him was luxurious. He was just planning a modest party, and this was far too colorful and elegant for what he had in mind.</p>
<p>At that moment, he heard classical music being played. The fact that musicians were playing instruments here for his granddaughter meant one thing…</p>
<p>‘… Young Master.’</p>
<p>He was sure that this was Roman Dmitry’s doing. Roman Dmitry, who was supposed to send Hans to the party, had prepared a wagon in advance and some people to organize the party.</p>
<p>Tears flowed as he witnessed the lavish party that Roman Dmitry had prepared for the single servant who served him. Seriously, he was such a good child. People said Roman had become cold after changing, but Hans knew he was warmer than ever.</p>
<p>The sore sight of the Dmitry family. From the standpoint of someone who had raised a son,  Hans found it difficult to see the child who had been trampled by others. And caring for him turned out to be the best decision he had ever made.</p>
<p>‘I am getting too old.’</p>
<p>His eyes were red. He wiped his tears as he found a familiar face.</p>
<p>“Father!”</p>
<p>His one and only son, Harrison.</p>
<p>As he was approaching him,</p>
<p>“Son!”</p>
<p>Hans gave him a broad smile and hugged him tightly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The party was going well. Delicious food, good people, and good music. Anyone would be happy. In particular, those who were invited couldn’t stop smiling at this.</p>
<p>“Now, we will take the time and open the presents.”</p>
<p>Harrison said.</p>
<p>He and his wife came forward with their six-year-old daughter. The initial plan was to open just four to five presents, but now there were dozens of gifts piled up.</p>
<p>“The first gift is the one prepared by my father.”</p>
<p>On behalf of his daughter, who was too young to open it, Harrison opened the box. And inside was a beautiful doll, which his daughter smiled at and hugged.</p>
<p>“This is such a beautiful doll. My daughter had begged me to buy it every day, but it seems that my father knew about it and prepared it. Thank you very much. I feel like today is a special day for my father.”</p>
<p>Hans smiled at his son’s words.</p>
<p>Opening presents was a tradition in Cairo. And after Hans’s present was opened, other gifts were opened one after another, revealing modest but heartfelt gifts.</p>
<p>But Harrison, who was about to open another gift, was a bit shocked.</p>
<p>“T-This…”</p>
<p>It was a small box, but the content was shocking.</p>
<p>“This is a gift from Viscount Conrad. Ruby… it seems like a ring. Such a gift, I am not sure what to say.”</p>
<p><em>Whisper.</em></p>
<p>“Viscount Conrad?”</p>
<p>“Why would a noble send a present to a commoner?”</p>
<p>The people were shocked at this. They could understand Roman Dmitry, but Viscount Conrad was too much. The problem was…</p>
<p>“Count Adelian’s gift.”</p>
<p>“Viscount Lawrence’s gift.”</p>
<p>Gifts were revealed with the most unexpected names and gorgeous appearances. The nobles in the northeast sent extravagant gifts worthy of their status as nobles, and everyone’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p>Actually, they couldn’t be considered gifts for the small child, but rather gifts to Harrison and an affectionate gesture to Hans.</p>
<p>Everyone lost their minds. The grand party alone was enough to surprise them, but the gifts were too much for them to take in. The series of events was something they couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>‘Why are those proud nobles sending gifts to Harrison?’</p>
<p>The people didn’t know that six hours ago, the nobles of the northeast region fought a full-blown war because of one piece of news.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 160 - Two Way (3)</p>
<p>The problem started with the report of the captain of the guards. The captain of the guards, who opened the mansion early in the morning, informed the higher-ups that some important people had arrived.</p>
<p>“You mean the people of Roman Dmitry have entered our estate?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“What is their purpose for entering?”</p>
<p>“There is a man named Hans among the servants of the Dmitry family. He is in charge of Roman Dmitry, and his granddaughter’s birthday is today. She lives here in Adelian. Judging from the fact that they prepared various items, it seems like a party.”</p>
<p>“… hmm.”</p>
<p>Count Adelian just nodded. Hans was just a servant but sending someone to care for a servant’s granddaughter was something a noble couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>‘This is why we cannot let this go.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He was a powerful noble in the northeast. By absorbing the alliance that was once against the Dmitry family, the Dmitry family now holds overwhelming power.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry, in particular, had a lot of work to do as an acting lord. People weren’t ignorant of the flow of power, and while they pretended not to be interested, they were all keeping an eye on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>That was why he sent someone. Count Adelian was sure that something was happening.</p>
<p>‘The northeast area was united under the name of the alliance. It’s true that nobles in areas far from Cairo should look out for each other, but the alliance exerts a kind of bond. The forces outside the Dmitry family’s eyes cannot join in without offering some help.’</p>
<p>Adelian—they were the northernmost region, and because of their geographical advantage, they could be called the center of commerce. On the contrary, it also meant that they were the most vulnerable when a civil war broke out. It was ironic, so Count Adelian always cared about his relationship with Dmitry.</p>
<p>And it was the same this time. Things that could be easily overlooked by others were what he held on to.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes later, the captain of the guards had gathered information about Hans.</p>
<p>“Hans is regarded as the person who raised Roman Dmitry since he was a child. Even when he was called the fool of the family, the man stayed by his side, and it is said that he has the right to speak within the Dmitry family, probably because of his years of experience and work. It appears that their intention is to genuinely care for Hans. Given Roman Dmitry’s positive attitude toward his people, his action of looking after Hans isn’t strange.”</p>
<p>“Right!”</p>
<p>His thoughts felt good. If Roman Dmitry regarded this person as someone precious to him, the image of the Adelian family actively caring for him was a golden opportunity to appeal to Roman.</p>
<p>Servant? It didn’t matter. If Roman thought Hans was important, then he was not just some servant.</p>
<p>“Call the vassals of the family right now! We’ll think about what we can do for Hans from now on. So Hans does not feel uncomfortable, and Hans’s son, Harrison, can be happy. Their happiness must be so great that the Dmitry family thinks well of us!”</p>
<p>Five hours before the party, the Adelian family seized the golden opportunity first.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Adelian family wasn’t the only one keeping an eye on Dmitry. Lawrence heard the information one step slower than Count Adelian.</p>
<p>“Lord! I heard from a person working in the Dmitry family that Hans, their servant, had decided to leave early due to his granddaughter’s birthday. What do we do? The Lord wanted me to report every small and big thing related to the Dmitry family, but I am not sure if we should even consider this since this only involves his servant.”</p>
<p>The information wasn’t perfect. Adelian confirmed the purpose of the visit through the captain of the guards, but Lawrence had no way to find out more about it. Yet Viscount Lawrence didn’t miss this chance.</p>
<p>‘Hans is the person who looked after Roman Dmitry. Even if Roman doesn’t think much of the man, he is still someone who manages things for Roman, and he is one of his people. People’s emotions change over the most trivial things. If everyone who follows Roman has a positive thought about the Lawrence family, it will give us a better chance.’</p>
<p>Since last year, Viscount Lawrence has taken care of every detail about Dmitry. At first, he wasn’t interested in people like Hans, but he always showed his face in meetings like the ones with Baron Romero, Rihanna, and Jonathan too. And now he was interested in this.</p>
<p>Knowing that Roman Dmitry was looking after his people, Viscount Lawrence didn’t intend to miss this chance. He had to take care of the occasion. No other special effort was needed. He thought that a friendly relationship with Dmitry was good enough.</p>
<p>“Hans is a person worthy of congratulations. Find out what his granddaughter likes, and prepare gifts for her.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>It started with Adelian then Lawrence. They all thought they were the only ones doing it, but there was no way the foxes of the northeast weren’t aware of it. The nobles, who later learned of the news, rose to their feet. Those who weren’t as meticulous as Lawrence hurriedly prepared their gifts, not wanting to fall behind others. And so the gift-buying craze spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>And two hours before the birthday party, Viscount Conrad, who had slept soundly the night before due to heavy drinking, was the last to hear the news about Dmitry.</p>
<p>“What?! Why are you only telling me that now?!”</p>
<p>“… the Lord was sleeping so soundly that I couldn’t wake you up.”</p>
<p>“Ugh. You moron. I told you to inform me of anything related to Dmitry, and report it to me even if I am about to die. Because of what we have done, we are not being looked at favorably. So we must not fall behind others!”</p>
<p>“I apologize.”</p>
<p>The knight bowed his head, but this wasn’t the time to punish him either. Viscount Conrad’s face turned pale, and he shook his head.</p>
<p>‘What gift do I give?’</p>
<p>There was no time. He wanted to prepare a personalized gift for the child, but the time to deliver the gift in two hours was tight.</p>
<p>Finally, he hurriedly ran to his wife’s room. His wife smiled brightly, but he immediately went for her jewelry box without even looking at her.</p>
<p>“H-Honey?!”</p>
<p>“Sorry! I am really sorry!”</p>
<p>Just a few days ago, he presented her with an expensive ruby ring as a gift. Thinking it would be the perfect gift, Viscount Conrad took out the ruby ring and ran without looking back.</p>
<p>Witnessing this, his wife said,</p>
<p>“You insane husband!”</p>
<p>His wife threw things at him, but what could he do? The future of the family was at stake here.</p>
<p>Unaware that Hans’s child was six years old, Viscount Conrad stole the adult-size ruby ring with an elated expression.</p>
<p>‘With this, the birthday party would be complete.’</p>
<p>The truth about the presents at the birthday party was all due to excessive loyalty to Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The presents in front of him were dazzling. Harrison was at a loss for words at the ruby ring he saw and the other luxurious gifts.</p>
<p>‘… what is all of this?’</p>
<p>The presents were something he was happy about. But Harrison was taught from a young age that things have consequences. It was a phrase that was engraved not only in his bones but also in the bones of all commoners. They knew greed would pull them into danger. So he was more worried than happy.</p>
<p>‘I don’t know why the nobles have decided to send me such gifts, but with the exception of a few, many aren’t for my daughter. If I get greedy with these things, I might have to pay a huge price later. I will smile now since these are presents, but I will return them all later.’</p>
<p>He was sure of it. Since his father lived as a servant all his life, he knew how dangerous it was to covet the nobles’ things.</p>
<p>“And the last present.”</p>
<p>A small envelope. Since the size was small, it didn’t seem like it was a present from a noble. Harrison, who was expecting something small, opened it and checked its content.</p>
<p>“Huk!”</p>
<p>What was written on the small piece of paper caught his eye.</p>
<p>[Recommendation for Admission to Glory Academy.]</p>
<p>His hands trembled. The Glory Academy—the best academy, where no commoner would even dream of going. It was an academy that the prestigious children of nobles attended.</p>
<p>A place one couldn’t enter without money. Harrison hoped for his daughter to attend the academy, but he knew that it wouldn’t be an easy task. But now he has received a recommendation letter. It was different from the other gifts, and he confirmed that this was from Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… Roman Dmitry wrote a letter of recommendation to Glory Academy for my daughter.”</p>
<p>A moment of silence fell as everyone was shocked. The previous gifts were good, but Glory Academy and a letter of recommendation were better.</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>Harrison thought back to a month ago. He spoke to his father about his daughter, and at that time, he casually mentioned the academy only to inform him and nothing more.</p>
<p>So he looked at his father. He was also shocked by this. It seemed like even his father didn’t know.</p>
<p>‘Thank you. Thank you so much.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. His gift was a surprise even Hans wasn’t aware of.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On that day, the party ended on a happy note. Hans returned to Dmitry earlier, saying that he was worried about Roman, and went straight to him.</p>
<p>“… the presents were too much. I didn’t ask for any special presents. I feel rewarded for the work I do for you, Young Master, and just remembering and acknowledging my existence is all I need.”</p>
<p>His voice was low. He was trying his best to speak calmly, but Hans was too moved by Roman’s actions.</p>
<p>Roman looked at him.</p>
<p>‘Hans is a bond left by Roman Dmitry.’</p>
<p>The relationship he had with him wasn’t intentionally formed. Hans was by Roman’s side when he was cursed and subjected to humiliation, and he still took care of him. And because he had the memories of the past, Roman knew how sincere this man was despite not having experienced them himself.</p>
<p>When he started living as Roman Dmitry, he was the first person he allowed to step into his comfort zone, and Roman never thought of Hans as a mere servant.</p>
<p>“Hans.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It is now a blurry memory, but looking back on my childhood, I spent more time with you than my father. At that time, my father had just become a noble, and he had too many things to do, and my mother, being as good as she is, was unable to care for me because of her new kids and other events. That is why the person named ‘Hans’ is special to me. Regardless of the difference in status, it stays the same.”</p>
<p>“… Young Master.”</p>
<p>Hans’s eyes turned red. What happened wasn’t much. Roman was just taking care of his people, and because he gained strength, the nobles also pitched in.</p>
<p>In such a situation, Roman was all alone. He wanted to do something for him where he shone the brightest.</p>
<p>“People’s emotions are not one way. Hans, you are my person, and because you blindly directed pure emotions toward me, you deserve everything I give you.”</p>
<p>Hans looked at Roman.</p>
<p>Looking at Hans like that, Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“I sincerely wish your granddaughter a happy birthday.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 161 - Two Way (4)</p>
<p>The True Demon Great War. That was the time when the spillage of blood and murders were running rampant everywhere.</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk, who had slaughtered all the people of the Forces of Justice, saw Crazy Demon drenched in blood.</p>
<p>“… euk, euk.”</p>
<p>The man exhaled lightly but with much difficulty. The sound of his breathing was hazy, and it seemed like something was wrong with his lungs, and he couldn’t tell if it was his own blood or if it was the blood of his enemies that was continuing to trickle down his face.</p>
<p>Crazy Demon wiped the blood with his sleeve. His body, which seemed weak, staggered, but he continued to drive his sword into the corpses of his enemies with the eyes of a beast.</p>
<p>“Kuak!”</p>
<p>And among them were survivors. Only after completely blocking any variables, the man got down on one knee, looking troubled.</p>
<p>“Are you fine?”</p>
<p>“… I am fine.”</p>
<p>Crazy Demon straightened himself back. Baek Joong-hyuk just asked about his condition, and the man was trying to look as strong as he could despite the pain in his body.</p>
<p>Even the one called Crazy Demon, who had amazing recovery abilities, had to grit his teeth and hold onto his consciousness, which seemed to be drifting away.</p>
<p>This felt unfortunate. He could have lived a normal life if he hadn’t met Baek Joong-hyuk.</p>
<p>And so, Baek Joong-hyuk said,</p>
<p>“The life of a warrior isn’t peaceful until the day he dies. You can only exist as a human on the borderline of death by testing yourself and struggling to live. Do you regret your decision to follow me?”</p>
<p>“I do not.”</p>
<p>“Following fate, we set out to conquer Murim. If no one rises to the top, the schemes of living life by fooling and killing others will continue. As the leader, I have a duty to fight for my followers, but you are different. If you say you want to return to your regular life now, then I will do anything to give it to you. I will provide you with enough treasures to last the rest of your life and build you a comfortable home where no one will ever think of touching you.”</p>
<p>He looked at Crazy Demon. People called him crazy, but in Baek Joong-hyuk’s eyes, he could see the image of their first meeting. He remembered the brilliance he had at that time.</p>
<p>He had no other options. This man struggled all the time after following Baek Joong-hyuk and became Crazy Demon.</p>
<p>Crazy Demon shook his head.</p>
<p>“Like the Lord said, I might not have an obligation to do this. The cause of this war and the interests involved might not have much impact on me either. In this pit of despair, you were the only hope that reached out to me. That is all. I only do this because it is what my Lord wants, and those who threaten my Lord will have to put their lives on the line.”</p>
<p>He smiled. His teeth were stained in blood.</p>
<p>“So do not abandon me. Just the fact that my Lord believes in me. I want to stay by my Lord for the rest of my life.”</p>
<p>At that time, Baek Joon-hyuk had a sudden thought about the people who believed in him. Just as they showed blind trust in him, he should also show them the same trust.</p>
<p>He didn’t care about the possibility of their betrayal in the end because the present was more important. In the life of a warrior, when one could die at any time, Baek Joong-hyuk was faithful to what he saw and felt.</p>
<p>And that was who he was, Baek Joon-hyuk. No—Roman Dmitry. Because he remembered his past life, he didn’t ignore the sincerity of those who believed in him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Hans went back to his room. It was a small space where only one person could live. Actually, the Dmitry couple had asked Hans to move to a better room countless times, but he never agreed to it.</p>
<p>This might be a shabby room for others, but for him, he found comfort in this room, where he had been residing ever since joining the Dmitry family.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>He sat on the ground. Looking at the room without a bed, there were traces of Roman Dmitry everywhere.</p>
<p>A broom was propped up against the wall. Since Roman often goes for a walk in the morning, Hans would get up earlier than him and sweep the pathway with the broom. And it wasn’t like someone ordered him to do it. Even if there were days when Roman skipped walking to do other work, he would still keep the pathway neat.</p>
<p>After that, when he would return to his room, he would take some things out of the storage closet. There was a towel if Roman sweated a lot, and other items related to him if he wanted to take a shower. Things that Hans didn’t use for himself were in the closet.</p>
<p>A blanket was laid out on the floor because his body never accepted the soft bed. In addition, there was a calendar next to it with Roman’s schedule.</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow is the schedule for the regular meeting.’</p>
<p>Roman’s schedule was recorded on it.</p>
<p>On the day of the meeting, he would organize the materials and pack the things Roman might need in his office. Then he would check the availability of the people who would attend the meeting.</p>
<p>They were details that Roman wouldn’t notice if nothing changed, but Hans would still manage everything so that Roman wouldn’t feel the least bit uncomfortable. Hans made sure to bring it up with his successor, Murphy.</p>
<p>At first, it was just the chores, but things became more hectic, and Hans barely had time to catch his breath.</p>
<p>His gaze stopped. Looking at something, he smiled. It was an old toy. Roman had once given Hans his most cherished toy as a gift since Hans always took care of him. Roman might not even remember it himself.</p>
<p>The sons of nobles have many toys, and this was just one of them, but Hans never forgot about it.</p>
<p>“… Young Master.”</p>
<p>Roman’s childhood was heartbreaking. Baron Romero wasn’t a strong person despite his power, and he always struggled to be noticed as a noble because he came from a common background. He didn’t have the time to care for his son.</p>
<p>Going back and forth between the mines, the forge, and his business partners, Rihanna was also busy helping Baron Romero. And so, they weren’t able to take care of Roman. They did say they were doing their best, but Roman was at an age where he needed his parents’ attention.</p>
<p>And then they became nobles. Baron Romero gave many gifts to his son, whom he didn’t care for, but Roman had already changed. Power and money changed everything. The child who had lived between the borderlines of being a commoner and being a noble drank and expressed his displeasure.</p>
<p>Since Hans was the one who had been taking care of Roman all this time, he knew why Roman was acting that way. People criticized the child. Hans could never forget the image of Roman smiling brightly and handing him the toy.</p>
<p>“… euk.”</p>
<p><em>Drop.</em></p>
<p>Tears flowed. He was crying as his emotions broke out.</p>
<p>A servant. Normal nobles look down on such people, so he thought that seeing Roman happy was all he needed to see. And that was good enough for him.</p>
<p>If one listened to the stories that servants from other families tell, there were some that would barely move you, and most would make you angry.</p>
<p>But Roman was speaking the truth. He mentioned that he wasn’t someone who only takes, but he gives back as much as he has received.</p>
<p>“Euk, eukkk.”</p>
<p>The tears didn’t stop. He was a servant from a humble background. Everyone knew it, and it was a reality that everyone couldn’t deny. He was such an existence. However, Roman treated people for who they were.</p>
<p>Hans couldn’t stop crying at the fact that there would be a day when the feelings he directed at Roman without expecting anything in return would be returned in this manner.</p>
<p>The wagon that took him there, the guards who escorted him, the gifts from nobles, and the letter of recommendation—all of these things didn’t matter to him, but the emotions that were contained within them did. The fact that Roman Dmitry recognized Hans’s sincerity made him burst into tears.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sad. He really wasn’t sad, yet he couldn’t hold back his tears. So he continued to weep.</p>
<p>A servant who usually kept his feelings in check let them all out without caring if anyone saw.</p>
<p>On that day, until late at night, Hans couldn’t sleep. And on Roman’s orders, no one disturbed Hans.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Rumors circulated about the birthday party. Although unintentional, the events of that day proved yet again how much Roman Dmitry cared about his people.</p>
<p>The Phoenix Magic Tower. The people who had gathered for a meeting spoke about the birthday party.</p>
<p>“… seriously, I don’t know what to say about it. When I first set foot in Dmitry, I was quite dissatisfied with the master. Why did we have to come to such a place to make money? No matter how much our status has fallen, isn’t this too much? However, looking at the recent events, I can’t help but feel that I lacked insight.”</p>
<p>It was Knox.</p>
<p>As everyone looked at him, he expressed his honest feelings.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, our new Lord, has done a lot for our Magic Tower. He took care of the migration process, allocated a large budget, and prepared a site to build the tower. We haven’t done anything for him, though. We are disgusting. I thought that we could repay the money by helping him in the future. Wasn’t that the same case with the Frank Kingdom? They gave us extreme respect, and then when our master went missing, they treated us like trash.”</p>
<p>He had negative thoughts because of their experience in the past. The man in his fifties, who thought that all goodwill had a purpose, felt like he had been abandoned by his teachings due to the recent birthday party incident.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is different. The eldest son of the noble family shouldn’t care for a servant. That might sound cruel, but that is the reality. Yet this man threw a party for Hans because he trusted him. It doesn’t matter if it’s serious or not. At least he is a person who works hard for the sake of the people who follow him, and that alone makes me proud of crossing paths with him.”</p>
<p>For the last three years, the Magic Tower has been tested so much. Their tower master went missing, Felix was lacking, and their tower’s future seemed hopeless. But everything changed when they arrived at Dmitry, and Knox has been happy ever since.</p>
<p>“Magic Tower master. I am sorry for this.”</p>
<p>All this time, Knox called him by name and never once by the title given to him.</p>
<p>“The Magic Tower master was right. You guided the falling tower onto the right path, and we eventually found the right place for us. From now on, I will completely follow you wherever you take us. I want to be someone who is trusted by the master and the Lord. So please forget my mistakes in the past and lead me and the others too.”</p>
<p>He bowed his head.</p>
<p>Knox was a magician who carried himself with pride. The oath he had just taken meant that he was now under Felix’s control.</p>
<p>Felix smiled at Knox’s actions. He could fully understand him. He accepted him because he knew that Knox also cared a lot for the Phoenix Magic Tower.</p>
<p>“I get it. We will live a different life here in Dmitry.”</p>
<p>On that day, the Magic Tower was united. People said Phoenix had no future, but under the name Roman Dmitry, they now share a core bond they didn’t have before. As a result, the Phoenix Magic Tower began to regain its original appearance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time passed, and one year later, the moment Roman had envisioned finally arrived.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 162 - Start Of Ranking Match (1)</p>
<p>The Valhalla Temple.</p>
<p>Willas, a priest of the Cairo branch, grumbled as he watered a withering flower.</p>
<p>“So boring.”</p>
<p>For the past year, it has been boring in Valhalla. Usually, although not often, he would receive requests for a Ranking Match, but as if everyone had made a promise, no one wanted a Ranking Match.</p>
<p>Willas knew why. The moment Roman Dmitry returned from the Southern Front and spoke about the Ranking Matches, all the rankers went silent.</p>
<p>“Exactly one year later, Roman Dmitry will cause havoc in the Cairo Kingdom’s rankings. Those who want to prove themselves just have one year to hone their skills and prove themselves against Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>It was a huge event. Roman Dmitry was a talent that the continent paid attention to. Regardless of victory or defeat, they wanted to test their skills against Roman Dmitry for the chance to instantly improve their positions as swordsmen.</p>
<p>What was the Ranking Match?</p>
<p>It was the stage for battles, where people with the desire to hold on to their honor fought to prove themselves. Moreover, it was a stage where many people would watch them fight and be given many rewards.</p>
<p>So all of Cairo’s rankers went into training. This was an unprecedented and unanticipated event in Cairo. People responded in ways that had never been seen before as a swordsman in his mid-20s turned the continent upside down.</p>
<p>And Willas understood their feelings. If the opponents were specific, then maybe people would’ve still submitted a request for a Ranking Match right now.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is truly on a strange borderline. Although his official ranking is 100th due to his duel with Homer. He proved his skills by defeating Butler, who was ranked 2nd in the Hector Kingdom. And this is where the problem starts. Common sense should say that the 100th ranker would prove his worth by going against the 99th one, but it is safe to say that Roman’s skills are already top-notch in Cairo.’</p>
<p>From the 1st to the 99th, everyone was Roman’s prey now. Not knowing whom he would choose, everyone was wary of Roman. Furthermore….</p>
<p>‘He is still in his mid-20s but he is already making everyone cautious.’</p>
<p>The people had their doubts. They admit Roman was strong, but they wondered if he had a trick up his sleeve when he defeated Butler.</p>
<p>Then, this could be a chance. It was nearly impossible for him to achieve that level in his mid-20s, so they hoped to claim victory over Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Because of the vague line, Cairo fell into silence. With the rise of a monster named Roman Dmitry, everyone was pushing themselves to grow.</p>
<p>‘No matter what choice they make, it is certain that Cairo’s ranking will be pushed down more once Roman Dmitry makes a move.’</p>
<p>This much was certain. According to the sources of Valhalla, the battle with Butler was real. Whether Roman challenged the bottom or top rankers, it was undeniable that all the rankers of Cairo would be pushed out of their ranks by Roman. It was then….</p>
<p>“Priest, priest!”</p>
<p>A follower of Valhalla came running and called out to him.</p>
<p>“We got a call from Roman Dmitry! The Ranking Match you’ve wanted to start is finally beginning!”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Willas smiled brightly like a child.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Marquis Benedict also received the same report.</p>
<p>“… is he finally moving?”</p>
<p>Last year, he did his best to recruit Roman. Roman Dmitry set a deadline of one year, but Marquis Benedict believed that only those who worked hard could achieve results.</p>
<p>He periodically sent gifts to Roman Dmitry and took care of congratulating his family when needed, and he even sent his own daughter to bring Roman to his side.</p>
<p>Despite such efforts, Roman didn’t give him an answer. Although he was liked a lot more by nobles, Roman Dmitry never gave a firm answer.</p>
<p>‘The recent situation on the international side is quite unique.’</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire was like an active volcano. One could never know when it would explode and invade Cairo. But above all, a Magic Tower had recently disappeared from the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>It started with the Phoenix Magic Tower of the Frank Kingdom. People didn’t care much about a fallen tower, but when the entire tower vanished, people realized something was wrong.</p>
<p>Since the Kronos Empire suffered the most damage, they were furious. Convinced that it was the work of other nations, they raised their voices, saying they would conquer the continent.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire was strong. And even knowing what kind of ambition they had, people couldn’t do anything against this beehive.</p>
<p>And the Valhalla Empire was the same. Despite Valhalla’s rapid rise to power as a result of its vast lands, lush forests, and the advantage of not sharing a border with Kronos, a head-on victory against them could not be guaranteed.</p>
<p>In this terrifying situation, the weaker nations were the most anxious. In particular, Cairo, which bordered Kronos, was in the strangest situation of all.</p>
<p>‘A war with Kronos is an unavoidable reality. When they cross the borders, they will surely try to capture our land, and Cairo will need an orderly movement to even try and counter them. The war on the Southern Front revealed Cairo’s flaws. Now is the time for a change. If the nobles can just get Dmitry on their side, then the current power system will not be stagnant.’</p>
<p>Royal knight. It was the last piece of the puzzle that Benedict needed to defeat the King, and so he waited patiently.</p>
<p>A person worth having. As long as Cairo secured the best talent, the nobles wouldn’t have a hard time overthrowing the king.</p>
<p>‘A weak king cannot handle the chaotic times. Even if Roman Dmitry doesn’t give us the answer we want, it won’t work out for him.’</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Crack.</em></p>
<p>He broke the cup.</p>
<p>Favor was born out of hope. At the moment when even hope wasn’t allowed, Marquis Benedict didn’t leave Roman alone.</p>
<p>Blood flowed from his hand.</p>
<p>As he wiped the blood off with a handkerchief, he called for his vassal.</p>
<p>“So, where is Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>Perhaps….. There was a high probability that he had come to the capital. It was because most rankers were in the capital. But the vassal’s answer was quite different from what he had expected.</p>
<p>“… well, Roman Dmitry is in the North.”</p>
<p>The North. This made it clear. Roman was starting from the bottom.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The 99th ranker, Jayden, gulped at the letter he had received a few days ago.</p>
<p>[As a ranker of Cairo, I am requesting a Ranking Match against Jayden, who is ranked 99th.]</p>
<p>Finally, the time came. Roman Dmitry, who was rumored to move unexpectedly, had pointed his sword at Jayden rather than the top rankers.</p>
<p>Actually, looking at the facts themselves, it was clear that Roman Dmitry was going to win. In the first place, there was no need to even talk about his battle with Butler. Just his victory against Homer proved that he could go up against the middle-level rankers.</p>
<p>But Jayden saw this fight with Roman as a chance.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is a person aiming to be the top ranker. If he is someone who lives up to the rumors, there is no way he would want to battle against the lower rankers, so this must mean the rumors were just exaggerations. That is why he must be expecting that he will lose to higher rankers, so he is trying to raise his rank from the lower levels by using us.’</p>
<p>It was a reasonable theory. If Roman Dmitry’s skills were real, it would be more beneficial for Roman to skip the meaningless battles with low-level rankers and challenge the top-level ones.</p>
<p>The only thing he could gain from fighting people with lower ranks was that people would talk about it. If he did this, he would only get exhausted, and his victory over other rankers couldn’t be guaranteed.</p>
<p>Maybe that was it. If fatigue builds up and he gets injured, then Roman could claim to be hurt and hold the position while stepping out of the Ranking Matches.</p>
<p>Was that why?</p>
<p>So Jayden didn’t avoid the fight. He showed up on the specified date and met Roman.</p>
<p>‘As the rumors said, he is young.’</p>
<p>Mid-20s. His appearance showed it. According to the rumors, he had already sent a request for the next opponent too.</p>
<p>‘I will do my best right from the start.’</p>
<p>He didn’t expect to win this match. But he wanted to lose by showing that he was someone who was worthy of being in the rankings.</p>
<p>Willas came as the referee for the fight.</p>
<p>As soon as he received the application for the Ranking Match, he rushed here and immediately gave the signal to start.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>“Start!”</p>
<p>The signal fell like lightning.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Jayden’s mind fell into darkness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The people were shocked.</p>
<p>One second. The result was instant. They wondered if Roman rushed in before Jayden was even ready to respond, but that was the end of it.</p>
<p>The people were silent. They knew Roman was strong, but like Jayden, they also wondered if Jayden had a chance.</p>
<p>Willas checked Jayden’s condition.</p>
<p>Seeing that he hadn’t come to his senses, he looked at Roman.</p>
<p>“It is a one-sided match, which makes no sense here. Do you really need to go through such fights? With Roman Dmitry’s skills, you can go for the top rankers right away, so why not skip all this and start from the 30th rank? You know it too, right? Mr. Roman? The fact that fighting from the bottom isn’t beneficial for someone like you who is aiming for the top.”</p>
<p>Willas also heard the rumors. The match against the 99th ranker. Roman was looking for an excuse to stop in the middle. If he defeats only those at the bottom ranks and accumulates exhaustion, Roman Dmitry could avoid fighting stronger rankers and even hold his honor.</p>
<p>It was a clever move. And when he would feel that he was not climbing the ranks fast enough, he could withdraw, saying he was hurt, and even give hope to the people that there was a chance that he would continue fighting later on.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“I understand why you are saying that. But this is why I need to rise from the bottom.”</p>
<p>The public’s words. Roman Dmitry chose his path from there. If he had been called a genius swordsman since he was young, people wouldn’t have cared much about this.</p>
<p>But the truth was different. Before Baek Joong-hyuk possessed Roman’s body, this man was called a fool and trash, so that title stuck longer, and people always doubted him.</p>
<p>Even though people recognized his skills as the hero of Cairo, they still doubted whether his skills were as great as the rumors.</p>
<p>And the fight with the 99th ranker ignited this.</p>
<p>No matter how much they thought about it, there was no reason for Roman Dmitry to push himself from the bottom to the top.</p>
<p>“I know what rumors are going around about this fight. People doubt my decisions because they think I cannot claim the top rank in the Cairo Kingdom. So I made this choice. From the bottom to the top. If I don’t stop and defeat everyone, no matter what kind of life I had in the past, no one will doubt me any longer.”</p>
<p>With that, Roman took a step back.</p>
<p>The next fight was scheduled, and seeing Roman leave, Willas felt his blood boil.</p>
<p>‘This is it.’</p>
<p>From the 99th to the 1st, Roman said he would fight everyone. Whether people doubted him or not, Willas was genuinely happy at Roman’s statement about wanting to prove himself.</p>
<p>In his boring life in Cairo, he had been waiting for someone like Roman. He wasn’t sure where Roman’s challenges would stop, but Willas wanted Roman to last for as long as possible.</p>
<p>The match ended in vain, and everyone in Cairo came to know about it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>People didn’t care about the first win. There were still negative rumors about it.</p>
<p>“Isn’t this too much? Roman Dmitry has a tight schedule. And no matter how great he is, if he constantly uses aura, wouldn’t fatigue pile up? Then how will he win over the top rankers?”</p>
<p>“Right. But he cannot delay that either. He said that he would defeat everyone, starting with Jayden, and go to the top, and if he postponed it, then it would be considered lame words.”</p>
<p>These Ranking Matches were unusual. Those who acknowledged Roman Dmitry’s strength thought it was difficult for him to get to the 1st rank.</p>
<p>One match every day for ninety-nine days. It felt impossible to finish all of them with victories. Yet it only took less than a week for their doubts to vanish.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 163 - Start Of Ranking Match (2)</p>
<p>Around nine in the morning, Roman faced Jayden and the match was decided in a second. And then before noon, Roman was facing the 98th ranker.</p>
<p>‘To think Jayden got defeated in one second.’</p>
<p>The 98th ranker, Delli.</p>
<p>He was deeply concerned. Roman Dmitry’s presence wasn’t as intimidating as the rumors said, but he heard that Jayden, who was the same level as Delli, was overwhelmingly defeated.</p>
<p>When he thought about it, the opponent seemed arrogant as he scheduled a match against Jayden at nine in the morning, and sent a letter to Delli saying he would fight him at noon.</p>
<p>‘Cheeky brat.’</p>
<p>His stomach churned in anger. He knew that he would lose but he had no intention of throwing flowers in Roman Dmitry’s path, so he accepted it. His goal wasn’t to win but to make Roman waste his stamina.</p>
<p>His plan was to drag the fight for as long as he could, so Delli took a defensive stance while waiting to be attacked.</p>
<p>And finally….</p>
<p><em>Flutter.</em></p>
<p>The signal was given.</p>
<p>Roman kicked the ground, and Delli, who was trying to defend the sword, caught the opponent’s strange movement.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>A short scream of pain.</p>
<p>And that was all.</p>
<p>Going against Roman, buying time also required skills.</p>
<p>“… 99th ranker Roman Dmitry knocked out 98th ranker Delli and shall move to the 98th rank.”</p>
<p>The viewers were shocked, but Roman didn’t even look back. Far from being happy at his victory, he just walked away.</p>
<p>Four hours later, Roman met the 97th ranker. He fought three matches a day. It was a shocking move. Roman wasn’t really expecting to be defeated by the opponents ahead of him, so he continued to move forward, calculating the time.</p>
<p>The 97th ranker also reacted like Delli. He couldn’t stand it and promised to make sure Roman had to put up a tough fight. But he was defeated in just three seconds.</p>
<p>The 97th ranker collapsed as he coughed up blood and wasn’t even in the state to check how he was defeated.</p>
<p>Three consecutive wins. The people who were present were shocked.</p>
<p>“… what are we even looking at?”</p>
<p>“He defeated three rankers in one day. Even though they are in the bottom ranks, they are talented swordsmen in Cairo with 3-stars or more. Does this make sense? Defeating them within ten seconds or less?”</p>
<p>As they were doubting their eyes, Roman was already moving for the 96th ranker. As if he didn’t even need time to recover from the fatigue, he left right after the results were declared.</p>
<p>The people followed him. How far would Roman Dmitry go? That was what they wanted to witness.</p>
<p>And in two days, Roman moved to the 91st ranker.</p>
<p>At that time, Jayden, who was his first sacrifice, regained consciousness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He had a terrible nightmare. After dreaming of a monster eating him alive, Jayden woke up with a cold sweat.</p>
<p>Thus….</p>
<p>“Huk, huk.”</p>
<p>He was gasping for air.</p>
<p>In his dream, the monster took the form of Roman Dmitry, and Jayden, who was desperate to win, witnessed that he couldn’t win.</p>
<p>“… what happened?”</p>
<p>“What happened? You tried to fight Roman Dmitry but couldn’t even handle one attack and fell down. You fainted and were unconscious all this time. But do you know what the lucky thing about this is? Everyone who fought Roman Dmitry after you hasn’t come to their senses yet.”</p>
<p>His heart sank.</p>
<p>In just one day……</p>
<p>But the people Roman dealt with?</p>
<p>Jayden thought it was strange and asked,</p>
<p>“People? How many people did Roman Dmitry fight with?”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>The infirmary doctor’s hand stopped. He had a long history of knowing Jayden, and he knew that Jayden was a veteran who had been struggling for a long time.</p>
<p>The fight with Roman—he understood it. But as a result of what just happened, Jayden’s choice can’t be defended now.</p>
<p>“Right after your fight was over, Roman Dmitry defeated a total of five rankers on the same day. In the morning, he fought you in the 99th rank; at lunch, the 98th ranker; before the sun went down, the 97th and 96th rankers; and in the evening, the 97th ranker. Do you know what it means? Roman Dmitry fought five matches, but he didn’t even gasp for air. You weren’t his opponents in the first place.”</p>
<p>“… insane.”</p>
<p>He cursed. Only then did he realize that Roman Dmitry was fucking insane. People naturally thought that the match for the 99th rank was a plan to save his face, but with this, it seemed like Roman was intent on going from the bottom to the top.</p>
<p>How could such a monster even exist? From the way he makes a bold judgment to how he puts his thoughts into practice, Roman Dmitry felt so extraordinary.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p><em>Throb!</em></p>
<p><em>“…?!“</em></p>
<p>When he tried to move, pain rose. Jayden looked at the infirmary doctor with a puzzled look as he said,</p>
<p>“A follower of Dmitry said that his master is someone who believes choices come with a cost. You will not be able to move your body properly until next month. I don’t know what kind of tricks Roman Dmitry did, but he completely messed with the muscles inside your body.”</p>
<p>One month. It was a huge price. Recalling the nightmare of being eaten by a monster like Roman, he felt his mouth turn dry.</p>
<p>“We need to stop the other ones.”</p>
<p>The rankers above the 90th rank would also try to deal with Roman. And like himself, they would not be able to do much. With his body not moving properly, Jayden didn’t want them to have the same experience as him.</p>
<p>And so he hastily wrote a letter. He was going to send them to all the rankers except for the ones at the top.</p>
<p>[I, who was once ranked 99th but has now been pushed down to the 100th rank, am warning you. Dmitry is a monster we cannot deal with. I couldn’t even last a second against him, and because I was unable to face reality, I am unable to move for a month. If you do not wish to have the same experience as me, do not stand in the way of Roman Dmitry. Confronting Roman Dmitry will never be able to give you experience, just horror. Please listen to what I am writing.]</p>
<p>And he sent the letters. He hoped all of them wouldn’t make the same mistake. Now was the moment for Cairo’s lower rankers to hold their breath and face reality in the face of a monster named Roman.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman took down the 85th ranker. The people felt odd. They knew he defeated Jayden in one second, but even though fatigue must have built up from his hectic schedule, the 85th ranker couldn’t do much and got defeated.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming victory. People who witnessed this realized how much of a monster Roman was starting to present himself as.</p>
<p>And by then, a letter had arrived for the rankers in Cairo.</p>
<p>“… I give up.”</p>
<p>“Look at the letter from Jayden! That ignorant bastard sent me a letter like a frightened kid because he lost to Roman Dmitry. And this is not a warning we can turn away from. It doesn’t matter that we are in the 80th ranks, but now even the 85th ranker collapsed like a 99th ranker.”</p>
<p>“The people’s rumors mean nothing. Roman intends to defeat all rankers from the bottom to the top.”</p>
<p>The rankers from the 84th and above began to give up. It has only been three days since the opening of the Ranking Matches, but people have begun to open the way for Roman.</p>
<p>They were afraid. The rankers who dealt with Roman, including Jayden, told them the cost of fighting against him, and everyone felt intimidated by how they were unable to use their bodies properly after the fight.</p>
<p>Wasn’t Roman’s ability proven in the last fight?</p>
<p>The idea that the rumors were exaggerated was wrong, and the people who followed Roman were just trumpeters announcing Roman’s growth to the world.</p>
<p>But sometimes, despite the warning, there were people who still made the choice to fight Roman, just like the 80th ranker, but they surely paid the price for it.</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p>“Kuak!”</p>
<p>He fell face down. Saliva and blood came out of his mouth, and his eyes were unfocused. The match was over. And this time too, Roman overpowered the opponent.</p>
<p>‘This isn’t enough.’</p>
<p>The opening of the Ranking Matches. Roman didn’t simply wish for honor.</p>
<p>After finishing the Rankings Matches, the people in Cairo, including Marquis Benedict, would force him to make a choice.</p>
<p>That was why he intended to make his presence known through these fights. And let them know what kind of strength the existence they wanted to recruit possessed.</p>
<p>And he gave Dmitry’s followers a reason to believe in themselves, and should a situation arise where a fight would ensue in Cairo, this would give them morale.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p>At first, he didn’t like the rankings. Just like how Valhalla challenged the rankings to make their presence known, Roman wanted his name to be at the top. So he chose to move from the bottom of ninety-nine strong people.</p>
<p>And if he decided to not side with any of them after this, no one would oppose him.</p>
<p>‘The opening of the Ranking Matches is just a signal for the future. The Salamander continent is in a situation where its land can be a whirlpool of war at any time, so I need to do this. And I need to have Cairo Kingdom under my control.’</p>
<p>People overlooked what kind of man Roman was. They never imagined that he was a man from the outskirts with so much greed. So the nobles just continued to watch and hoped that Roman would get tired from this. And if he collapsed without taking the top spot, then they would force Roman to make a choice.</p>
<p>Even now, not many people believed that Roman Dmitry was the best swordsman in Cairo.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In just one week, the rumors that doubted Roman died down. Due to his overwhelming skills and the repeated declarations of abandonment, Roman Dmitry quickly reached the top.</p>
<p>From the 39th to the 31st, all the top rankers in the ranks of 30s gave up. They accepted defeat as if they had discussed it beforehand.</p>
<p>But the 30th ranker accepted his match.</p>
<p>“Fernando. What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“You heard the rumors too. Your body would turn into a mess after fighting with that man. There is no way you can face Roman Dmitry who is a 5-star swordsman and is in the top ten rankers in Cairo. Everyone below that should just surrender, so why make a reckless choice?”</p>
<p>“Listen for once.”</p>
<p>The same rankers came and told him. Just like they said, they had united. Seeing some surrender and others choosing to fight, the ones who surrendered looked miserable.</p>
<p>So they just all chose to stay happy. They gave up their matches since they didn’t even have a chance of lasting one minute.</p>
<p>“It is my choice to make.”</p>
<p>Fernando showed a determined face. The 30th Gatekeeper—that was his nickname. People say that the 30th rank was great in itself, but Fernando knew that his nickname wasn’t just a compliment. It was a kind of mockery to him.</p>
<p>Even though he was immediately placed as the 30th ranker, the reality was that, when a new talent appeared, the rankings would be pushed from there.</p>
<p>If one of the top rankers didn’t die in the battle with Kronos, then he would have been in the 31st.</p>
<p>“Stupid bastard. So you want to fight to ruin our reputation?”</p>
<p>“At least say the truth. It wasn’t me who ruined your name, but your own weakness in admitting defeat out of fear. So do not force me to act like you.”</p>
<p>“Fuck.”</p>
<p>“Oh, that stuck-up bastard.”</p>
<p>The other rankers just turned their heads, feeling frustrated.</p>
<p>Their thoughts? He understood them, but Fernando wasn’t going to give up.</p>
<p>‘They and I are different. People who are gifted will improve their skills even without having to risk their lives in war, but I have to do this. The moment I decide to step back I feel like I have regressed.’</p>
<p>Fernando—people always expressed their doubts about him. If his sword skills were truly great, then why was he placed in the 30th rank?</p>
<p>But there was a fact that people didn’t know of. Since birth, Fernando has never had a smooth mana flow in his body. The problem was that even after reaching 4-stars, it was impossible for him to demonstrate it.</p>
<p>That was the reason he had no choice but to remain in the 30th rank in his later years. And so he tried to solve the problem in different ways.</p>
<p>Experience—he fought against many strong people. Based on that, he accumulated experience in how to make his sword technique work.</p>
<p>Even if his mana couldn’t overwhelm the opponent, he tried to gain an edge with his sword technique. As a result, he was ranked 30th.</p>
<p>He could defeat those with 4-stars or lower with just a sword technique, but he had no way to deal with stronger opponents that had an overwhelming difference. So whenever a genius came up, Fernando would step aside.</p>
<p>People ridiculed him for how he stayed in the same position for ten years, but Fernando had a hard time accepting this.</p>
<p>Actually, avoiding the challengers was one way. But by accepting each challenge, Fernando hoped to gain something.</p>
<p>‘According to the rumors, Roman Dmitry’s sword technique is known to be perfect. I won’t be able to block the opponent’s attack a few times with my skills, and I hope to improve a little after fighting with him. That is all. My reputation as ranker means nothing here.’</p>
<p>The ranking was a façade. In the end, swordsmen speak with their skills.</p>
<p>Fernando always trained, and no matter what people said, he swung his sword until the sun went down.</p>
<p>And this was his identity—sloth. It was because his skills had stagnated in the same spot, not because he was lazy.</p>
<p>He imagined dealing with Roman Dmitry. Fernando fell into a trance and didn’t stop swinging his sword until his body was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p>And like that, the day was bright.</p>
<p>“Phew.”</p>
<p>He took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He stayed up all night but didn’t feel tired.</p>
<p>Then he stepped forward.</p>
<p>From now on, he would deal with the real Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 164 - Start Of Ranking Match (3)</p>
<p>People flocked to watch the fight between Fernando and Roman Dmitry. In the meantime, all the top thirty players refused to fight, so people’s expectations were high on how the 30th ranker, who was the gatekeeper, would perform in the fight.</p>
<p>“I wonder if Fernando can last one minute.”</p>
<p>“It seems like an impossible thing for me. Fernando showed a weak appearance against the 4-star swordsman. If Roman Dmitry chooses to fully use his aura, then he might not last for even ten seconds, and if the opposite happens, then he might show a decent fight.”</p>
<p>“I think the same way. I don’t know about Fernando, but I acknowledge his solid basic skills and techniques.”</p>
<p>The people had negative thoughts about Fernando. They called him the ‘limit of effort.’ It was clear that reaching the 4-star mark was great, but the basic skills he knew were more proficient, which made it frustrating.</p>
<p>In addition, his sword technique overwhelmed those with higher ranks, but he wasn’t able to improve the power of his aura, so Fernando just stayed in the 30th rank.</p>
<p>One year ago, Fernando’s fight with Vertov showed his limits. Vertov, who was ranked 99th at the time, succeeded in defeating Fernando despite being overwhelmed with a sword technique.</p>
<p>Aura explosion. A powerful blow completely changed the fight. And it appeared that it was still the same now.</p>
<p>Looking at Fernando, who was going to fight Roman Dmitry, people seemed sad.</p>
<p><em>Tak!</em></p>
<p>He got on stage and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>‘… the world is so unfair.’</p>
<p>He felt bitter. Roman Dmitry looked so young. Just looking at his appearance, one would believe that he was in his early 20s, but he was the same man who was causing havoc in the Cairo Kingdom.</p>
<p>From the 99th rank to the 30th rank, the monster appeared in front of him in just a week’s time. A weird inferiority began to rise—he felt envious.</p>
<p>People didn’t know that every day, from the moment he woke up until he closed his eyes at night, he worked as hard as if he might die. And he felt tortured because, no matter how fast he ran, people were catching up from behind.</p>
<p>Fernando stayed in the 30th rank for ten years. He was seething with an inferiority complex toward people like Roman Dmitry because of how easily they could defeat him with their talent.</p>
<p>It was good, even when it felt pathetic. He wouldn’t have put forth any effort and would have given up long ago if it weren’t for his inferiority complex.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. Make me your scapegoat so that I can take a step forward. Show me the world you live in.’</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He grabbed his sword. He wasn’t going to be careless here. He was weak, but he was willing to face this fight.</p>
<p><em>Flutter.</em></p>
<p>The flag fluttered in the wind.</p>
<p>At that moment……</p>
<p><em>Grung.</em></p>
<p>Fernando’s aura created a powerful explosion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He did his best right from the start. Fernando raised his aura and used it on both of his legs to maximize his speed.</p>
<p><em>Tak!</em></p>
<p>‘The start is ahead.’</p>
<p>Fernando studied Roman’s methods in his last fight. Roman Dmitry was an arrogant swordsman. No matter what kind of attack his opponent made, he would not retreat more than three steps.</p>
<p><em>Huk.</em></p>
<p>He struck his sword. The sword cut through the wind, and aura shone on the sword.</p>
<p>Roman avoided Fernando’s attack. As he expected, Roman Dmitry only took one step back, and Fernando launched another attack.</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded on one side of his sword.</p>
<p>The direction of the attack changed, and the sword, which had been moving in a straight line, aimed for Roman’s neck. It was an irregular movement.</p>
<p>At the same time, Fernando raised his aura in preparation for his opponent to block the attack.</p>
<p><em>Huk.</em></p>
<p>But Roman leaned over. He had shocking flexibility, and Fernando suppressed his shock as he tried to slam Roman’s body down.</p>
<p>It was common sense to avoid a difficult slash, but Roman Dmitry’s movements had been restricted by the series of attacks, making it impossible to dodge the sword that was headed straight for his bent body.</p>
<p>But still…</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>He turned his head. He looked straight at Fernando, and he launched an attack this time as if nothing had happened. And the attack wasn’t delayed. Like a spring, Roman defied the force of gravity and attacked Fernando.</p>
<p><em>Kwang.</em></p>
<p>His arm bounced back as their auras clashed. Again, it showed the difference in their strengths. But strangely enough, Roman didn’t even try to finish the attack he was doing.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Roman backed away.</p>
<p>And at the sight of him widening the distance, the people cheered, but Fernando knew that his opponent didn’t end it on purpose.</p>
<p>‘Why?’</p>
<p>His stomach boiled. Fernando intended to win the game from the start, so he launched a series of attacks while boldly moving at his opponent.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s move was perfect against him. It would have been difficult to avoid if he had tried to attack the moment he moved, but it was safe to say that Roman wasn’t intending to finish it.</p>
<p>A mistake? No. Judging from his last move, Roman Dmiry wasn’t the type to make mistakes.</p>
<p>‘Is he looking down on me?’</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth at Roman’s actions. Roman always defeated his opponents first, and considering that he even took down the 40th ranker in thirty seconds, it seemed like he intentionally fought against him.</p>
<p>Why? Because he was the 30th ranker and the gatekeeper?</p>
<p>Now that he was about to go beyond the 30th rank, was Roman Dmitry intending to send a message to the top rankers? Whatever it was, his pride was hurt. He wanted to finish this fight, but Fernando had something more important to do.</p>
<p>‘Trample on my pride. Please show me the way to improve, even if it is only a small ray of hope.’</p>
<p>All these years of remaining in the 30th rank had made him give up his pride.</p>
<p>Fernando struck his sword again. His aura exploded, and the attack he attempted was clean.</p>
<p>When it came to sword technique, he could be called the most overwhelming one, but when it came to aura, he would always falter.</p>
<p>He knew it too. The fact that everyone laughed as the fight progressed, but Fernando continued to do his best against Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Again, his attack was blocked. The timing was good. His attack should have worked, but it couldn’t break through Roman’s defense because his aura wasn’t enough. He was upset, annoyed, and angry.</p>
<p>But then…</p>
<p>[From now on, move your mana as I say. Then it will get much easier.]</p>
<p>He heard a voice in his head. Realizing that it was Roman Dmitry’s voice, Fernando’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His head was a mess. What kind of trick was he up to? His rationality told him to ignore it, but Fernando stopped attacking.</p>
<p>[Fernando, a 4-star swordsman, the reason you are weak compared to your skills is that your aura doesn’t move smoothly. Aura is a force that exerts destructive power through an eruption-like process. If you know your physical limitations and still stick to them, you will never progress.]</p>
<p>His eyes trembled.</p>
<p>Roman moved forward. He couldn’t understand how he could hear Roman when he wasn’t even moving his lips.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>They exchanged clashes, and Fernando pushed Roman to the side as he continued to listen to him.</p>
<p>[The eruption of general aura refers to accepting mana and exploding it through a path. However, mana doesn’t always just have one path. All the swordsmen of Salamander follow a standard system and use the same path of mana, but in reality, that isn’t all. If the path of mana you use has been cramped or blocked since birth, why didn’t you think of opening another path?]</p>
<p>The method of mana. The skills honed since childhood form a path suitable for aura usage. When mana spreads throughout the body along a certain path, high-level swordsmen are able to exert powerful auras and widen the path of the mana.</p>
<p>Fernando was like everyone else. Having formed a passage through a commonly known method, he was only able to use a weak aura.</p>
<p>But that was different from the truth. The system that this world practiced suppressed his creativity.</p>
<p>[It has been a long time, so it must be hard to open a new path, but isn’t it worth a try?]</p>
<p>Roman’s sweet words were totally enchanting. The people’s eyes? His honor? All of those didn’t matter. Fernando focused on Roman’s words, not caring if they were a joke or not. He was ready to accept the new change.</p>
<p>Even after decades of hard work on the known method, he realized that the old method was like a sand castle in front of Roman’s words, whom he didn’t know too well. He felt Roman was earnest. He wasn’t sure if Roman could be trusted, but his instincts were telling him to try it.</p>
<p>It was then that the sparring changed. Roman pushed Fernando and told him how to attack, and Fernando did so accordingly.</p>
<p>The one-sided match, the fight that should have ended in just one minute, went on for ten minutes. By the time the people were getting bored….</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>Mana rose. Fernando’s eyes widened at the feeling of his mana moving on a new path.</p>
<p>‘… so it was possible?’</p>
<p>A very minute change. This wasn’t the stage of aura eruption, but he knew just how difficult doing this was.</p>
<p><em>Smile.</em></p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>At that moment….</p>
<p>[Now let’s end it.]</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p>The sword filled his view, and Fernando hurriedly tried to block it, but the attack shook his consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Puak-</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He was stunned. After coming to his senses, Fernando blankly looked at the sky.</p>
<p>‘Why didn’t I think of opening another passage?’</p>
<p>Stupid. Even though there was room for improvement, he didn’t even recognize it and kept making the same mistake for decades.</p>
<p>Actually, this was expected. It was difficult to escape from common thoughts, and mana was something scary to experiment with.</p>
<p>It was a dangerous challenge, so people would follow the established system over experimenting on their bodies, so Fernando thought the method wasn’t the problem.</p>
<p>Everyone was getting good results with it, and he was the only one that experienced a problem, so he continued to blame himself.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the existing method was born from trial and error.</p>
<p>“<em>Tsk.</em> He is broken.”</p>
<p>“They said the 30th ranker is the gatekeeper, but this shows how strong Roman Dmitry is.”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is a monster. Still, he is ranked 30th. How could he think about fooling around for ten minutes? Fernando was played with like a child. I saw him lose the explosiveness of his aura. He looked so helpless to me.”</p>
<p>“This is the difference in level.”</p>
<p>People whispered around Fernando. They were the onlookers who hadn’t left yet, and when he heard them talking, Fernando returned to his senses.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry…!’</p>
<p>The people’s ridicule didn’t matter. A being who showed him a new path. In order to make use of the new possibilities, he had to follow Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p><em>Jump.</em></p>
<p>He got up. Roman hadn’t gone far yet. While the surroundings were filled with people, Roman Dmitry was moving away. People looked at Fernando pushing them and wondered what the matter was.</p>
<p>“Mr. Roman!”</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>He fell flat on the ground. Seeing Roman’s gaze on him, Fernando shouted,</p>
<p>“Thank you so much for teaching me! I will not forget the grace Roman Dmitry has shown to me!”</p>
<p><em>Whisper.</em></p>
<p>“What is this?”</p>
<p>“Teaching?”</p>
<p>The people were shocked. The fight between the two was one-sided. They thought Fernando looked unsightly, so what was this?</p>
<p>Roman stopped and looked at Fernando, who was lying on his stomach.</p>
<p>‘The 30th ranker, gatekeeper.’</p>
<p>It wasn’t shocking—this situation and Fernando coming to him—Roman Dmitry has been waiting for this to happen.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 165 - Start Of Ranking Match (4)</p>
<p>The Public Ranking Match. It wasn’t just about trying to prove oneself.</p>
<p>‘The Valhalla Empire uses this ranking system to determine the levels of talents. Being able to discover unknown talent before others will be a huge benefit to the Valhalla Empire.’</p>
<p>His own experience proved Valhalla’s goal. When Roman Dmitry was still undervalued, they recognized the value of Roman through the Valhalla Temple and so they made a move to approach him.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be just a simple coincidence. The Valhalla Empire moved on its own and spread its culture of ‘ranking’ widely on the continent and laid the plan so that they could stimulate the desires of others for their growth. As a result, the Public Ranking became a culture in the continent.</p>
<p>It was a device for unknown talented people who never received attention to reveal themselves to the public. As the Valhalla Empire administered the ranking system, they could greet the people who were talented knocking on the door of the temple. Thanks to this, the Valhalla Empire was able to expand its power. By accepting talented people from all over the continent, they were able to build a powerful force comparable to the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>And that meant Roman could also be in such a system now. The rankers in the Cairo Rankings were very attractive listings that have been verified.</p>
<p>‘Among the rankers, there are those who took sides and those who didn’t. I will judge their potential through these matches. From the 99th to the 1st. Among them, there will surely be those whom Dmitry can use. I can bring them in front of me and have a chance to check their skills in the Ranking Matches.’</p>
<p>One stone, two birds. It was an efficient plan. Roman deliberately created this plan and began to push the rankers into a corner, making them give up. From then on, Dmitry would confront the forces of the outside world, including the power in Cairo.</p>
<p>In a situation where common sense prevailed in a match that was deemed unfavorable, he had no need for people who were afraid and backed down. He only needed those who decided to face him even after hearing the rumors. And among them, he planned to take Fernando, the 30th ranker, who had piqued Roman’s interest.</p>
<p>‘People say that Fernando is the Limit of Efforts.’</p>
<p>He heard about his weakness—the eruption of aura. It was Fernando’s story that caught his attention, although he needed to meet him in person to solve his problems.</p>
<p>But even when blocked by a wall, Fernando didn’t give up. And even though losing to Vertov had been a huge shock to him, Fernando still stayed in the 30th rank.</p>
<p>At first, Roman doubted it. Could it be that he was a loser who acknowledged reality? However, when he met him in person, Fernando’s eyes, although filled with inferiority, didn’t look like those of losers.</p>
<p>‘People think of inferiority as a bad thing. But I think differently. Inferiority stems from the desire to overcome one’s own shortcomings and the constant desire to surpass others. Inferiority is an honest emotion in humans. The moment one acknowledges it and accepts the reality, one becomes humble and is ready to go beyond the limit and move into a new world.’</p>
<p>He liked it. Watching Fernando struggle until the end, Roman gave him a passing mark on his head. So he gave him new directions and waited for him to come to him after their match. And now….</p>
<p>“Thank you for teaching me! I will not forget the grace Roman Dmitry has shown to me!”</p>
<p>Fernando’s shout—it was the picture that Roman painted.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They moved to a different place. Fernando was being polite. With this ray of hope that came into the desert, he asked cautiously,</p>
<p>“… may I ask how you found out about my problem? People think that I don’t have the talent for aura and that there is no problem with the aura eruption process that we are taught.”</p>
<p>Fernando asked Roman. The other person was just someone in his mid-20s. He admits that he is a great person, but the problem was the theory, which he couldn’t understand right away.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“It is quite simple. If you are a 4-star aura user, it means you have reached a good enough level. However, unlike the power of your aura, your eruption was unusually weak. And it’s not like the destructive power of your aura was low. Hence, applying the eruption process differently should solve your problem. I didn’t say it with certainty, but based on my experience, I just thought that there was a high chance that the passage of your aura was the problem.”</p>
<p>“… that is amazing.”</p>
<p>He was genuinely amazed. Cairo’s hero, what kind of life did Roman Dmitry have? The days he had lived were shorter than his own, but the way he spoke was as if he had had a completely different experience.</p>
<p>Was that why? He didn’t care if he was inferior to Roman.</p>
<p>For a while, silence lingered.</p>
<p>Fernando hesitated for a long time, then said,</p>
<p>“I will be honest. In the path Mr. Roman Dmitry spoke of, I see hope. I have found a clue to solve the problem with my aura, but I don’t know what the outcome will be if I do it alone. If you know the perfect solution, can you tell me how?”</p>
<p>He was fifty years old, and the opponent was a lot younger than him. But still, there was no hesitation in his thoughts. Roman Dmitry was kind enough to show him the path, and although his intentions were unknown, Fernando wasn’t going to miss this chance.</p>
<p>It was the greed of a swordsman. If he hoped for wealth or honor, he would have sided with some strong nobles, but he was always ridiculed in his life for staying in the 30th rank because he stuck to developing as a swordsman.</p>
<p>“It isn’t difficult to tell you how.”</p>
<p>Roman said.</p>
<p>His heart began to race. Fernando looked at Roman and showed a look in his eyes as if to say that he would do anything.</p>
<p>“However, I don’t really like deals where I don’t get much. If I solve your problem, I should be paid back properly.”</p>
<p>“Do tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>“What I want is clear. I want the person called Fernando to live his life for me.”</p>
<p>He stated his purpose. Roman coveted the sword named Fernando. Just like how the Valhalla Empire reached out to Roman, Roman also revealed his greed for Fernando.</p>
<p>If he refused, he would just walk out without another thought. It was Roman’s way not to force the loyalty of others on him, but the answers of those who received Roman’s proposal were consistent.</p>
<p>“I, Fernando, swear allegiance to Mr. Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>Chris, Kevin, and the people who said they would follow Roman—all of them came to the same conclusion.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is the one who will guide me on the right path.’</p>
<p>It was an unwavering decision. Roman Dmitry’s firm gaze on him gave him the confidence to trust him.</p>
<p>So on that day, Roman Dmitry acquired Fernando, who was constantly courted in Cairo. It was only a small incident in the Ranking Match, yet unbeknownst to the people, Roman’s plans were reaching their end.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the last few days, Cairo has been a mess. As Roman Dmitry defeated the top rankers one after another after the match with Fernando, the nobles gathered.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry’s actions aren’t so unusual. Isn’t this really about defeating Count Nicholas?”</p>
<p>Nicholas—a Royal Knight and the number one swordsman in Cairo. People regarded Count Nicholas as an untouchable person, but Roman’s current actions showed that it was possible.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t just win a few matches. He rose to the top level by defeating the rankers from the 99th rank and made his way to the top. And the swordsmen who were known to be the top rankers were also tasting one-sided defeat against him.</p>
<p>So the people were sure that Roman Dmitry had the qualifications to challenge Count Nicholas, who was hailed as the number one in Cairo.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“It is still premature. Count Nicholas is a strong ranker who ranks 80th in the continental rankings. Roman Dmitry has a history of defeating Butler, but Nicholas is entirely different.”</p>
<p>The continental ranking. The difference between the 100th and the 80th ranking was huge. And….</p>
<p>“Actually, what Roman Dmitry did until now doesn’t even mean much. Defeating Butler proved that he is a 5-star swordsman, which meant winning over all those people outside the top eleven was expected. The real matches start now. They are the best swordsmen, who are on a whole different level, and even if Roman defeats them, it will be tough for Roman to aim for the first position. But to be in the top ten at his age is good in itself. As soon as the matches are over, we need to make our move to bring him to our side.”</p>
<p>“… then, what if Roman Dmitry defeats Count Nicholas?”</p>
<p>Nicholas’s defeat would be a huge surprise. It meant not just the emergence of a new top position but the collapse of the existing power system. And this made Marquis Benedict’s expression turn cold.</p>
<p>“The reason why the side of the royals has been able to endure so far is due to Count Nicholas’s presence. However, if Roman Dmitry defeats Count Nicholas, the meaning of his existence will entirely change. He would become the best sword in Cairo, and his family has huge wealth. With the union of the northeastern area, Roman Dmitry has the perfect environment to build his power, and he even has the potential to create a new power system in the kingdom. That is an unacceptable result. If Roman Dmitry doesn’t accept our offer after defeating Count Nicholas…”</p>
<p>They calculated all scenarios and the worst outcome. The moment Roman Dmitry returns to Dmitry, the problem will become worse than just dealing with the puppet king. Last year, after much thought, Marquis Benedict came to such a conclusion.</p>
<p>“We need to eliminate Roman Dmitry by any means.”</p>
<p>The talent of the nation? The eyes of the people? None of those mattered. He needed to be nipped in the bud before he grew into something they couldn’t handle. All the nobles had serious expressions.</p>
<p>Seeing the Public Ranking Matches, the thought of trying to kill Roman Dmitry didn’t show a positive sign. Of course, this was only applicable when things would go worse for them. They were still convinced that far from defeating Count Nicholas, he would struggle from the 10th position.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“Everyone, secretly bring the troops from each family to the capital. The moment we force Roman Dmitry to choose, whatever choice he makes, he will not escape from our grasp.”</p>
<p>At the same time that the nobles were plotting, Roman faced the 10th ranker.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the match against the top 10th ranker, people began to talk.</p>
<p>“Who will win?”</p>
<p>“Zeron is a 5-star swordsman. No matter how strong Roman is, Zeron’s experience will help him win.”</p>
<p>“A fight between Zeron’s skills and Roman Dmitry’s spirit? I vote for Roman Dmitry. Even if he doesn’t reach Nicholas, I am sure he will take down Zeron.”</p>
<p>“I vote for Zeron. He isn’t an easy opponent.”</p>
<p>For the first time, the opinions were divided. Zeron was a swordsman who had been active in Cairo for twenty years. Even if Roman Dmitry showed an overwhelming performance, dealing with Zeron was a different matter.</p>
<p>Zeron was also confident. Following Count Gregory, he stepped out in front of the people with confidence.</p>
<p>“Such a great guy. Starting from the 99th, you reached all the way here.”</p>
<p>He acknowledged Roman, but that was all. Even after watching all of Roman’s fights, he was sure of himself. Until he reached the position he was in right now, he had gone through countless battles, and like Roman Dmitry, he cut down countless people who were strong.</p>
<p>The position of the 10th rank wasn’t just for the name. Everyone talked about how the true power of the ranking system would be displayed from now on, and for the first time, they were worried about the winner and the loser.</p>
<p>Everyone’s expectations rose. What kind of great win would it be? Who would win? No matter the outcome, they thought this would be a fight that would go down in history. So people flocked to see the fight. And…</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p><em>“Cough!”</em></p>
<p>Everyone lost their minds. Zeron, who was so proud when he got on the stage, knelt down, looking as if he was in so much pain. Helplessly pushed by Roman’s attack, he coughed up blood on the ground.</p>
<p>“Should we do more?”</p>
<p>The fight wasn’t over. Roman had given him three chances: when he hit his stomach with the sword, when Roman took a step back, and when Zeron became overconfident only to get hit in the face. It was doubtful if this was even a fight.</p>
<p>And now Zeron was terrified. He was sure of his win, but seeing the truth changed everything.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry isn’t even doing his best.’</p>
<p>The people of Cairo, including the nobles, all thought that the true fights would start from the 10th rank.</p>
<p>That’s right. From the moment Roman Dmitry’s success was questioned, he intended to reveal his strength in earnest.</p>
<p>“… I surrender.”</p>
<p>Zeron lowered his head.</p>
<p>The shocking result left those watching the fight unable to accept the reality in front of them.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 166 - Cairo’s First Sword (1)</p>
<p>It was a shocking sight. His face which showed confidence looked odd with his sunken cheekbones and blood flowing down his swollen nose. Zeron’s eyes were out of focus. He didn’t even think about looking at Roman Dmitry’s face, and even as he spoke of his surrender he was trembling like a lost child.</p>
<p>“… this.”</p>
<p>“Go to Zeron!”</p>
<p>Count Gregory’s people stormed to the stage. Zeron was a person Count Gregory cherished the most, so he couldn’t handle anything going wrong with him. It was a scene he couldn’t accept despite seeing it with his own eyes.</p>
<p>Even when Zeron was still on stage and the people were speechless about what just happened, Zeron was being treated.</p>
<p>People said that the matches would be different starting from the 10th ranker. This wasn’t just some mere lie, Zeron was someone who proved his worth all the time. So it didn’t make sense for him to lose like this.</p>
<p>People would have heartily applauded if Zeron had knelt at the end of a fierce battle, but their minds couldn’t accept such a one-sided match.</p>
<p>And Roman was standing tall on the stage. While everyone was silently watching, Roman looked around the crowd.</p>
<p>‘The plan has been laid out.’</p>
<p>The fights until now were just appetizers for his plan. Cairo was a small nation. At least at this moment, he thought to imprint on everyone what kind of existence Roman Dmitry was. Roman said,</p>
<p>“To be honest, I am a little disappointed. One year ago, I declared this. What do you think was the reason? I didn’t need time to hone myself. I just wanted the rankers in Cairo with whom I would be dealing in the future to be ready. And this is the result that I see.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t polite to the losers. He ridiculed Zeron. Roman openly emphasized how terrible a swordsman he was.</p>
<p>“I found out after defeating Zeron, the 10th ranker. Other than Count Nicholas, there is no one who can handle my sword in Cairo. Therefore, I will omit all the meaningless steps. Three days later, in the same location as today, I will face the rankers from the 9th to the 2nd in order.”</p>
<p>At that moment, people were shocked. What did it mean? They heard it with their own ears, but they couldn’t understand it.</p>
<p>“And I will defeat them all and then challenge the first sword of Cairo.”</p>
<p>Roman’s words shocked everyone. It was Roman Dmitry who showed them outstanding sights, but these words were too much.</p>
<p>It was certain now. Roman Dmitry wasn’t an arrogant man, rather he was a madman.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cairo was in a mess again because of Roman’s declaration. Defeating the rankers in order from the 99th to the top itself was already a huge accomplishment, but he said that he would deal with the top rankers one after another. This was shocking.</p>
<p>And the protagonists of these remarks gathered in one place.</p>
<p>“… what do we do? To be honest, I am thinking of surrendering. There isn’t much difference in Zeron’s skills and mine, and didn’t Roman Dmitry take him down with an overwhelming force?”</p>
<p>Bruno, the 9th ranker, said.</p>
<p>On that day, Bruno watched the match. He went there to find out more about his opponent and prepare in areas where he was weak, but when he saw what happened, he was terrified. This wasn’t someone he could deal with. In a fight where his defeat was clear, he didn’t want to make a harsh decision and end up like Zeron to save his pride.</p>
<p>The man sitting across from him, Oscar, the 2nd ranker, said,</p>
<p>“But still, you cannot surrender.”</p>
<p>“Mr. Oscar!”</p>
<p>“There is no one following the King’s side here. So if we let Roman Dmitry take on Count Nicholas, the result is effortless and beneficial. But Roman Dmitry mocked Zeron. He cut him down in front of everyone while saying that he wasn’t worthy of the top 10 rankings, and then he declared war, saying that he would take all of us on the same day. This problem isn’t so simple. If Roman Dmitry loses to Count Nicholas, people will mock us for being cowards for surrendering and giving Roman Dmitry the second place without a fight.”</p>
<p>It was a matter of pride this time. From the moment people’s eyes were focused on them, they couldn’t step back.</p>
<p>“… so you want to deal with Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>It was the 5th ranker who asked.</p>
<p>Everyone here was offended by Roman’s words. However, keeping their personal emotions aside, there wasn’t a single person who wouldn’t acknowledge the skills of Roman Dmitry. He was a monster who made his way from the 99th rank to the 10th.</p>
<p>Witnessing Roman Dmitry defeat the rankers of Cairo without even taking a rest, Cairo’s rankers began to respect him. They were sure that Roman Dmitry was a talent the nation should be proud to have. Everyone acknowledged him, even though he was young.</p>
<p>And Oscar said,</p>
<p>“Yes. We have to directly deal with him. That’s why I called you all together. I don’t have the confidence to defeat him, and I am cautious about this proposal because it forces you to sacrifice a lot, but please make sure that Roman Dmitry gets as exhausted as he can when he reaches for me. The compensation will be guaranteed by Marquis Benedict, whom I serve. And if we join forces like this…”</p>
<p>The look in his eyes changed. It was his pride of being 2nd. Knowing that Marquis Benedict wanted Roman, he didn’t want Roman to pass through.</p>
<p>“I will risk my life to defeat him. And in front of everyone, I will say that if it wasn’t for you all, I would have never won.”</p>
<p>Hearing Oscar’s words, the rankers looked at each other. They didn’t like the role of being the sacrifice. If it weren’t for Roman’s taunt, they wouldn’t have even gathered in such a place. But now that their plan was laid out, their pride wasn’t allowing them to step back.</p>
<p>“We will follow your plan.”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, Let’s show that guy the reality. What? Knock us all down in one day? I promise that I will end him before he even reaches Mr. Oscar!”</p>
<p>“You are right! Let’s join forces!”</p>
<p>The rankers were bustling with enthusiasm. They cried and cheered about overthrowing Roman Dmitry and began to make plans all night long.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Exactly three days later, Roman appeared at the promised place and waited with the crowd gathering, and soon the rankers appeared.</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“From Bruno to Oscar! They really showed up! From the 9th ranker to the 2nd!”</p>
<p>“I never thought they’d respond to Roman Dmitry’s taunt! If this happens, then the winner cannot be predicted.”</p>
<p>After the fight with Zeron, people asserted that Count Nicholas was the only one who could defeat Roman. But dealing with eight swordsmen at once was a different thing.</p>
<p>And they weren’t just some beginners. They were rankers who had great reputations all over Cairo.</p>
<p>Everyone on the Western Front was proud of Bruno, and didn’t he show a strong presence against the powerful Kronos Empire?</p>
<p>The eight swordsmen appeared one after another. And as Roman was looking at them, he recalled the report he received days ago.</p>
<p>‘The faction of the nobles led by Marquis Benedict is gathering troops, and perhaps their purpose is me and not a rebellion. If I decline Marquis Benedict’s offer, he seems to be willing to take this to the extreme.’</p>
<p>It was a predictable move. What was the reason for the nobles’ faction to be trembling now? It might be difficult to touch Kronos or Valhalla with their force, but they were still the group of people who managed to take the third position in the nation’s power system, and they had even driven the royal family’s faction to a corner. Even in the Cairo Kingdom, they were able to create an atmosphere where everyone followed their words. It was interesting.</p>
<p>The rankers in front of him didn’t side with the royal faction, so they decided to join forces while following the words of another faction. This was the reality. Unless they sided with the royal family, everyone turned to the nobles’ side.</p>
<p>‘The power system in Cairo will not allow me any more time. This will be a road with a dead end. Will I eat them, or will they eat me? At the crossroads, I will have to choose.’</p>
<p>He smiled. This was the moment that he had been patiently waiting for. The peace had lasted too long, and Roman didn’t like it very much. It was the start of the finale.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Roman went up to the stage.</p>
<p>No more questions and no more answers. From now on, it was time for him to show them the reality.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At first, it seemed like a plausible plan.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry will try to end the fight soon. In a situation where he has to deal with eight rankers, he will want to avoid a long-term battle. The arrogant brat made a mistake. If we hadn’t united, we might have rushed to him like moths to a flame and fallen one after another.’</p>
<p>Bruno had one purpose—to defend. After raising his aura to protect his body, he was going to drag out the battle for as long as possible. He didn’t have the confidence to win. But if he was determined and persevered, he was confident that no matter how great the difference in their skills was, he would be able to tire out Roman. But….</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p>‘…?!’</p>
<p>The moment he blocked Roman’s attack, Bruno’s eyes widened. This was different from what he had expected. His sword, wrapped with aura, should have blocked the attack from Roman Dmitry, but his sword split into two. This was a shocking scene.</p>
<p>Bruno felt something pierce his chest without even having a chance to counter.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered. He didn’t die, but the sword did go through his chest, and Bruno collapsed.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>Silence fell. Those who expected a fierce match went speechless upon witnessing this. But still, this was the first match, and Bruno was the 9th ranker, so they thought it would be different.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p>The sword bounced. The 8th ranker also tried to block Roman’s attack, but just like Bruno, his sword was cut in half, and he barely blocked it. This was the best that the 8th ranker could do.</p>
<p>Roman’s fist dug into his stomach, and he slammed his face on the floor as he coughed out everything.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>One minute.</p>
<p>The third one, the 7th ranker, went up looking nervous and didn’t hold on for long, as his mind was already giving up.</p>
<p><em>Puak-</em></p>
<p>It was purely overwhelming. Roman’s aura showed destructive power that couldn’t be blocked by his 5-star aura, and no matter how much he tried to block him, he couldn’t prepare for the next counter.</p>
<p>The 7th ranker had also spent a significant amount of time in the spotlight. He wasn’t the type to fall down like an unknown swordsman, so when he lost, the people were silent.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>The fourth person.</p>
<p>The fifth person.</p>
<p>The sixth person.</p>
<p>The matches continued.</p>
<p>The plan that they put together all night long had no meaning as every one of them was collapsing. As time went on, people’s faces turned pale. The result must be in line with common sense for them to show admiration, but this was too intimidating for those watching.</p>
<p>Everyone here didn’t know much about Roman. Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, took over the body of Roman Dmitry, and was equipped with the power to defeat Butler in a very short time.</p>
<p>And how long was it? Just barely a year’s time. And the move that shocked people was only the result of his short time of training.</p>
<p>And he spent the last year not giving out much information about himself. People only remembered the Roman from a year ago, but the present Roman had undergone many changes.</p>
<p>And when he made this plan, Oscar and the others were just small puppies that he didn’t even have to think much about. No matter how strong they were, they were only frogs in a well who weren’t even listed in the continent’s ranking.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The 3rd ranker collapsed, and as he fell to the ground bleeding, the shocked faces behind him could be seen.</p>
<p>“… T-This makes no sense.”</p>
<p>Among them was Oscar, who was now looking pale. He was speechless as the sun rose in the middle of the sky, despite having declared that he would win at any cost against Roman if the others exhausted him.</p>
<p>The fight started at noon, but the sun was still in the middle of the sky, and the stage was already full of blood marks.</p>
<p>Only then did he realize that Roman Dmitry was a monster that Cairo couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>This was a death sentence.</p>
<p>Hearing Roman’s voice calling out to him, Oscar tightly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 167 - Cairo’s First Sword (2)</p>
<p>At the empty palace, Daniel Cairo impatiently waited for someone in a Royal Knight’s attire.</p>
<p><em>Creeaak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened and his gaze turned there. The knight went inside, after paying respects to the King, and spoke of what he saw.</p>
<p>“It was an overwhelming win. After taking down Bruno who came up first at once, he even knocked down Oscar in less than 30 minutes. Your Majesty, My King, Roman Dmitry defeated all the 9th to the 2nd rankers in just one day. There is no reason to stop him from challenging the top place.”</p>
<p>The knight spoke in a low voice.</p>
<p>He knew what the result that was just mentioned now meant. The people of Cairo would simply cheer for an event that would go down in history but Daniel Cairo couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>“… in the end, this happened.”</p>
<p>His voice trembled.</p>
<p>Right in front of him, he looked at the man who was looking at him.</p>
<p>The man had gray hair that was neatly brushed back and had a robust body even though he was in his 60s. The pattern of the Royal Knights was engraved on his chest. And the sun crest proved that he was the best swordsman among the Royal Knights.</p>
<p>“Count Nicholas.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Is there any way to avoid this fight with Roman Dmitry? I do not doubt that you are the best sword in Cairo, but I can only think of one possibility. Lately, the nobles have been moving, and even Marquis Benedict is in a precarious position now. In this situation, if the first sword of Cairo falls… my position with no power will fall prey to the nobles.”</p>
<p>In the past few years, Count Nicholas has become a support system to protect the royal family. For the sole reason that he swore allegiance to the King, the nobles didn’t try to do anything. So that was why his presence was absolute.</p>
<p>Oscar had challenged for the top position, but after losing overwhelmingly without even lasting for a minute, he didn’t try again.</p>
<p>But what if…if he would be put down to his knees? Then it would mean the collapse of power.</p>
<p>And it was clear that if the absolute existence would collapse, everyone’s suppressed desires would burst out.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas said,</p>
<p>“I understand very well what Your Highness is worried about. That is why we cannot avoid this challenge. Marquis Benedict’s faction of nobles didn’t rebel because they lacked strength. They just hate to lose the power system they worked so hard to establish crumble, but they still have the strength to do anything they want. If I refuse Roman Dmitry’s challenge, I might be able to keep the title given to me, but if that happens, Marquis Benedict will not think of my existence as a threat.”</p>
<p>The four factions and the precarious system of power. Marquis Benedict didn’t unreasonably raise issues since he considered what would happen if he started a rebellion.</p>
<p>And in the end, Count Nicholas was all alone. There was a possibility that he could be defeated, but the balance was kept because, before falling, Count Nicholas would shed a lot of blood. So it was a truce.</p>
<p>But from the moment Roman defeated Oscar, Count Nicholas had no choice.</p>
<p>“An absolute who ignores the challenge of a challenger has no meaning. Trust me. I will defeat Roman Dmitry and once again prove why I am the top sword of Cairo.”</p>
<p>A strong challenger appeared, which made it even more meaningful.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas stood up from his spot and showed the appearance of a giant.</p>
<p>“Then I shall go.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On his way to the palace, he heard a familiar voice.</p>
<p>“… are you really alright? Regardless of victory or defeat, the hyenas of Cairo will not stand still if you get injured.”</p>
<p>It was Ventnor. He was the person who sought out Roman Dmitry on behalf of the King in the past. He looked at Count Nicholas with worried eyes.</p>
<p>“It has already been more than sixty years since I began to follow the Cairo royal family. It doesn’t matter if I am fine or not. It has to be done, and I will do it.”</p>
<p>Count Nicholas said.</p>
<p>He looked through the window, and in the blinding sunlight came the memories of the past.</p>
<p>“Nicholas. Take care of my son for me, please.”</p>
<p>It was the former King.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo’s father talked to Count Nicholas on his deathbed. He was a truly weak human being.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas lived for the Cairo royal family from the moment he was born and was loyal to the King.</p>
<p>The collapse of the power system in the kingdom was due to the former King. If he hadn’t neglected the fights happening within the kingdom, then the royal family would have been holding the power now.</p>
<p>But he still couldn’t blame the King. The weakness in the royal family symbolized his incompetence, but the King was a kind human being.</p>
<p>When the King saw how tired Nicholas was from his rigorous training each day, he gave him a cure. He even stole him away to goof around, and whenever he ate good food, he would invite his people to eat together with him. They were good times.</p>
<p>Soon, the ignorant child turned into a sword, representing the Cairo Kingdom, and the King, who was shining like the sun, collapsed at the viciousness of the position he held.</p>
<p>There was no way to protect him. Eliminating the threats was the best Count Nicholas could do, so he felt determined to become stronger.</p>
<p>Finally, the King died, and even though people called him the top sword of Cairo, he couldn’t stop the division.</p>
<p><em>Smirk.</em></p>
<p><em>Smile.</em></p>
<p>Facing the sunlight outside the window, the face of the previous King kept coming to his mind.</p>
<p>‘When I said I would follow King Daniel everyone called me a moron.’</p>
<p>The former King died, and Count Nicholas was subjected to so many temptations. If he had held onto one of them, he might be living a different life now, but not once did he regret it.</p>
<p>“Ventnor.”</p>
<p>“… yes.”</p>
<p>“What kind of man is Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>He changed the subject since this was no time to dwell on memories. Reality hit them, and it was now time to focus on what was right in front of them.</p>
<p>Ventnor thought for a moment. He only talked one time with the man, yet the memory was so vivid.</p>
<p>“Actually, I cannot say anything for sure about Roman Dmitry. But at the time when he was still underappreciated, he was confident about his path. He is a person born to be a natural predator, and if he didn’t have the confidence to win, he wouldn’t have started the ranking matches either. From the 99th to the 1st, everyone called him reckless, but it is clear that he will prove himself and eventually appear before Count Nicholas.”</p>
<p>That was what Count Nicholas also believed.</p>
<p>However, he wasn’t sure of winning this time.</p>
<p>“So be careful. If you fall, the royal family is done for.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the next day, the sun was bright. In Cairos, the capital of Cairo, a huge crowd gathered.</p>
<p>The people who filled the path parted like waves when one person walked through.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>He took a step. And as he held his sword, he calmly accepted the gazes of the people. He arrived at a huge mansion, which was his destination.</p>
<p>And as he entered through the gate that was wide open, he could see the people surrounding him and the man waiting for him in the center. It was the existence called the First Sword of the Cairo Kingdom.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas looked at Roman Dmitry and said,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, I have faced many challenges in the past, but none as arrogant and bold as you.”</p>
<p>He spoke with pure admiration. From the 99th rank to the 1st, Roman Dmitry rose from the bottom.</p>
<p>The people’s doubts turned into shock, and now they anticipated seeing something exciting.</p>
<p>“You are just in your mid-20s. You are undoubtedly born with the qualities to make a name for yourself beyond the Cairo Kingdom and even the continent. But not now. I, Richard Nicholas, will exist as the greatest sword of Cairo until the moment I rest.”</p>
<p><em>Shhh.</em></p>
<p>He drew his sword, turning the atmosphere heavy.</p>
<p>The two hadn’t done anything yet, but the people went silent at the suffocating feeling.</p>
<p>“Come. I will show you the wall of reality.”</p>
<p>At that moment….</p>
<p><em>Flutter.</em></p>
<p>Willas gave the signal.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry rushed at Count Nicholas.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The fight was intense right from the start.</p>
<p>Roman tried to attack right away, not wanting to waste time, and unlike his previous opponents, Count Nicholas countered Roman head-on.</p>
<p>Aura exploded.</p>
<p>It felt like the earth and sky were shaking with each clash, but neither of the two backed out.</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p>The move that took down Zeron.</p>
<p>As the space-slicing attack was about to slash his forearm, the Count lunged ahead as he swung his sword.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p>And at the same time, he tried to counter.</p>
<p>Roman retrieved his sword and blocked the opponent’s attack, and this time, he made the attack he used to take down the third ranker. It was a chain attack that struck forward.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas’s face distorted as he wasn’t given time to gasp for breath, and the attack was being aimed at his head, arms, body, and legs.</p>
<p>The 3rd ranker wasn’t able to withstand this at all.</p>
<p>Although this attack was fast and scary, Count Nicholas’s sword was calm.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakakang!</em></p>
<p>The fight was in a huge open space, but it was difficult for the people watching them to follow them with their eyes, so they moved back a couple of steps at their clashes.</p>
<p>Four attacks.</p>
<p>Four defenses.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas’s presence was huge.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Roman’s attacks were strong. No one was able to block his attacks properly, and they faced a one-sided defeat that put their reputation as rankers to shame. So the people were doubtful. But this clearly showed why Count Nicholas was the greatest sword, and he seemed so different from the others.</p>
<p>In particular, people began to question their memories as they watched Oscar, who ranked second in the rankings, helplessly collapse. But their memories weren’t wrong.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas’s skills were truly unparalleled. Unlike the other rankers in Cairo, who couldn’t even withstand five hits, he had already exchanged more than twenty with Roman. And it was then….</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>There was a gap in the attack.</p>
<p>And Count Nicholas’s eyes changed.</p>
<p>A vortex of powerful aura rose, and his sword moved to slash down his opponent.</p>
<p>It was a threatening move, and this time, he planned to give a strong blow to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>But…..</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry easily blocked it. It wasn’t like he was expecting it, but it was more like he only reacted when he saw it.</p>
<p><em>Shhh!</em></p>
<p>The Count was pushed back, making him grin.</p>
<p>“You are an interesting man.”</p>
<p>From the start until the end, Roman Dmitry’s attitude and expression didn’t change, nor did he appear like a challenger.</p>
<p>As if he was the best in Cairo, he didn’t back down at all and pushed forward.</p>
<p>It was interesting. It surely was.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry wasn’t afraid of him at all.</p>
<p>‘One mistake and I will lose.’</p>
<p>This was the reality.</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He straightened his sword, and mana began to seethe from him.</p>
<p>Cairo’s best sword—his own attack began.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 168 - Cairo’s First Sword (3)</p>
<p>Richard Nicholas, the 1st ranker in Cairo. People acknowledged this man as the best sword in Cairo but they also said that they would not live life the way he did.</p>
<p>“What pleasures does the Count live by? Even though he has been the best for a long time, instead of enjoying wealth and honor, he goes back to relive his training days each day. What a boring person. If I had the skills like his, I would live a comfortable life by siding with Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>But there was a time when Count Nicholas also thought of such things.</p>
<p>And his schedule felt boring. According to his servant, he lived at the training grounds most of the day except for the time he meditated in the mornings.</p>
<p>From the basic movements to advance sword skills, Count Nicholas would be drenched in sweat as he kept repeating the process and sparring with his subordinates. That was his schedule from morning to evening.</p>
<p>And when he skipped his external duties as a Royal Knight, he would focus on his sword technique.</p>
<p>And he was now over sixty years old.</p>
<p>Even though he was the best swordsman in his youth, considering the social status he held, no one understood why he still lived on the training grounds.</p>
<p>But he still continued to live the same way. No matter what people said about him, the sword never left his hands.</p>
<p>The reason?</p>
<p>Because he liked it?</p>
<p>Because he was crazy for swords?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Count Nicholas forcibly closed his eyes from the aura rising from within him.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want to live this fiercely either.’</p>
<p>In his sixty years of life, he lived his entire life for the royal family. Count Nicholas, who was flogged for being lazy in sword training when he was young, was now a pillar of support for the royal family.</p>
<p>He knew it too. What would happen the moment he became a little weak? And the fact that the Cairo royal family was bound to collapse like a sand castle due to the evil people aiming for the throne.</p>
<p>That couldn’t happen. The royal family was everything Nicholas had. His blind feelings for the family, which had been imprinted in his head, turned Count Nicholas into someone who treasured the family, even if people thought it was boring. And so he held his resolve.</p>
<p>And when he heard the rumors that Roman Dmitry had defeated Butler, the Count went to the training grounds and continued to train against an imaginary opponent all day long.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo and the former King’s smiles and kind words gave the Count a reason to live. The existence that people called great believed and followed the value of mere humans.</p>
<p>One day, his son who lived a normal life unlike him asked,</p>
<p>“Father, why do you do that?”</p>
<p>His father was exhausted each day. Contrary to his fame and name, his father would always return home with a shabby appearance.</p>
<p>At the words of his son, who gave up the sword because he didn’t want to be like him, Count Nicholas showed a heartfelt smile.</p>
<p>“Son, I am the First Sword of Cairo. People call Cairo a small nation and look down on us, but in the small nation called Cairo, I am an existence that no one can approach. That is the purpose of my life.”</p>
<p>And today, people didn’t know the fact that in order to face Roman Dmitry, who was a young challenger, the Count had been preparing for a year before the Ranking Matches were even announced.</p>
<p>Cairo’s First Sword, Richard Nicholas, was completely different from the others that Roman had stepped on.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The ground shook.</p>
<p>In the middle of a violently raging sandstorm, Count Nicholas pushed Roman.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>His face changed. In the beginning, Roman led the attack, but this time, the Count was the one leading.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry doesn’t run.’</p>
<p>Last year, Count Nicholas studied the data about Roman. The testimonies of when Roman faced Homer, the battles on the Southern Front, and when he defeated Butler—he kept all the facts that were informative in his head.</p>
<p>People would ask why the person considered the best in the nation was wary of a young man in his mid-20s, but the Count was the type that did his best in everything he did. The opponent was brilliant and talented, and if he couldn’t overcome him with talent, then he had to press him down with experience.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>There was a huge roar.</p>
<p>With the goal of not letting his opponent run away, he deliberately raised his aura.</p>
<p>Since the aura that distorted the atmosphere couldn’t be stopped just by dodging, Roman raised his sword to block it.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakang!</em></p>
<p>And that was when it started.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry attacked with the best moves he could think of. Instead of judging with his eyes, he began to continuously attack under the assumption that the opponent would block all his attacks.</p>
<p>Right, left, left, and overhead.</p>
<p>Continuing to change the pattern of his attacks, Roman Dmitry blocked all the chances to prevent the Count from coming up with a new move.</p>
<p>One breath.</p>
<p>The price to pay was high.</p>
<p>Cairo’s First Sword attacked by taking the initiative in one flow.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>“… this is the best sword in Cairo.”</p>
<p>The people who were looking from afar were shocked at this. Even though they couldn’t properly see the fight because of the sandstorm, Count Nicholas displayed a tremendous presence. They were certain that Count Nicholas was an existence different from the others.</p>
<p>Oscar, who was ranked second, wasn’t even in the continental rankings, but Count Nicholas ranked 80th. And that was five years ago. Even after that, this man never neglected his training, and the people said that if he challenged others, his rank would rise.</p>
<p>He was at the age of sixty and he was starting to get old. However, he clearly demonstrated how he was able to support the power system in Cairo.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas made his way through the storm. To protect the honor of the royal family and to prove that he was strong, he never delayed his attacks since he knew that he could die from a single mistake.</p>
<p>Just like that, Count Nicholas was roaring. And the more his presence burned, the more Roman Dmitry also began to burn.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Nicholas was strong. Living as Roman Dmitry, he had met a lot of people, but he was sure that none of them were as strong as the Count.</p>
<p>‘He is one level higher than Butler.’</p>
<p>The fight was intense, and it made his blood boil. Ever since he stayed silent for the past year, Roman has waited for a moment like this.</p>
<p><em>Kaaanng!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>He swung his sword. To meet his opponent’s intention and respond to him, he fought him head-on. Without backing down at all, Roman Dmitry countered the opponent’s attack head-on.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>There was a great rumble.</p>
<p>The head-to-head fight drained their minds, but both of them didn’t back down. The First Sword of Cairo? No, the stronger the opponent, the better. Roman Dmitry just wanted to crush his opponent with force.</p>
<p>‘Count Nicholas is strong. But in the end, he is only strong by the standards of Cairo. There are dozens of beings on the continent that are stronger than him, and I cannot even predict how many of them haven’t revealed their identities to the world. For the future, I need to overwhelm Count Nicholas.’</p>
<p>He acknowledged his opponent. If he had been on the same level as Oscar, Roman Dmitry would have ended the fight without prolonging it for another second.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>Nicholas moved to attack. His sword, which was covered in aura, fell like stars from the sky.</p>
<p>Roman stepped forward. Following his opponent’s intention, he also raised his aura to counter it.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>There was a series of clashes as the two continuously collided. As if the fight would end with a single hit, they didn’t want to back out.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Just one hit, but Count Nicholas’s expression changed. It was subtle, but he could feel his body bounce a little at the repulsive force.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>It was the same this time too. He raised his strength more than before, but he was only pushed back further.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>Every time they clashed, Count Nicholas was being pushed back little by little. He obviously had the upper hand at the start, but the more he faced his opponent, the more he saw a new reality.</p>
<p>As if his body was wet from rain, the results piled up once again. The fact that he was being pushed back further made him belatedly realize something was wrong.</p>
<p>‘I am being pushed back by strength.’</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the people who were watching began to realize that the flow of the fight was going in a strange direction.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>People had a particular image in their minds prior to this fight. If Roman Dmitry caused an uproar here, they thought it wouldn’t be from an overwhelming fight.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is just in his mid-20s. No matter how great a swordsman he is, he cannot compete with the aura of Count Nicholas, who has trained for sixty years. Because Count Nicholas is superior in every way, Roman Dmitry must devise a variable that will allow him to win.”</p>
<p>That was what everyone thought, but the results in front of their eyes were different.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Count Nicholas was being pushed back. At first, he was only pushed back so little that it wasn’t noticeable, but now it was one step after another.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>This time, he was pushed back behind the line.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas gritted his teeth. The more he blocked Roman Dmitry’s sword, the more disgusted he was feeling.</p>
<p>‘This makes no sense.’</p>
<p>He was shocked. He was not different from the others. He prepared for a year to face Roman Dmitry, but he never thought that he would be crushed like this. It was not arrogance but confidence in himself.</p>
<p>Because of his experience for sixty years, he was sure that the aura of a swordsman in his mid-20s wouldn’t be much.</p>
<p>His common sense crumbled. The opponent was a monster. People called the Count a genius, but even in the realm of geniuses, Roman appeared to be stronger.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He was now pushed all the way back.</p>
<p><em>“Cough.”</em></p>
<p>In an instant, he coughed up blood. The shock of the constant attacks made thick blood drip down his mouth as if his organs were messed up.</p>
<p>The eye-catching red drops of blood continued to drip down, and the Count sighed.</p>
<p>Being the supporting power of the Cairo royal family, he tried so hard to not make it collapse, and he was wary of the nobles’ faction but not of the young blood.</p>
<p>What if.…</p>
<p>….he lost?</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was claiming to be neutral, but he would never help the King. According to what he knew about him, this man was a practical person.</p>
<p>Unlike him, who had devoted his life to being loyal one-sidedly, Roman would never do that to the royal family.</p>
<p>‘I can’t lose.’</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth and gulped. He suppressed the disgusting smell of blood, and he looked at his opponent.</p>
<p>It was funny how Roman Dmitry was giving him time, as if telling him to calm down and fight him again with all his might. Seeing the guy who was just a challenger act like the champion, the Count raised his aura.</p>
<p>‘Fine, I am not grateful at this consideration.’</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He held his sword one last time. If even this attack failed, then there was no way to defeat Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He kicked the ground.</p>
<p>This time, Roman Dmitry confronted him head-on.</p>
<p>Aura explosion.</p>
<p>It was Count Nicholas’s secret. When he manifested the power that made him the 80th ranker, the aura surrounding his sword burned like a volcano.</p>
<p>‘This is the end.’</p>
<p>It was then that the Count clearly saw it. Even facing an aura that burned like it would devour the world, and even if one understood what it meant, Roman Dmitry didn’t dodge the attack.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 169 - Cairo’s First Sword (4)</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The earth shook. The shockwaves on the ground caused the onlookers to stumble or be thrown backward, and the outcome of the fight was obscured by a cloud of dust that prevented them from seeing it.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a fight between humans. The people who were now covered in dust just looked around with shocked faces.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>The wind blew. And once the situation was revealed, everyone’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p><em>“… cough.“</em></p>
<p>Count Nicholas was down on one knee. Even as blood flowed from his mouth and nose, he raised his head and looked at the man in front of him.</p>
<p>‘Was I defeated?’</p>
<p>In their last clash, Count Nicholas did his best. He was convinced that the head-to-head confrontation would be a sure move, but Roman didn’t back down and attacked him head-on.</p>
<p>And this was the result.</p>
<p>Even his own attack, which he had trained for sixty years, was unable to defeat Roman Dmitry, and he ended up coughing up blood.</p>
<p>And the sight of Roman looking down at him with an unstrained face made him feel more miserable.</p>
<p>‘This is it.’</p>
<p>The match was decided, with Roman Dmitry as the winner. It was his turn to admit defeat, but Count Nicholas forced himself to get up.</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>Blood was flowing down from his arm. His whole body wouldn’t listen to him, and he gritted his teeth as he raised his sword.</p>
<p>“… continue.”</p>
<p>His voice cracked.</p>
<p>The willingness to accept the victor was said to be a virtue of a swordsman, but Count Nicholas couldn’t accept the reality, even if he looked miserable because he carried the royal family on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He accepted the fact that he was defeated, but he couldn’t kneel when the thought of the royal family being harmed in the future hit him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure what to do. He had already lost his role as a supporter by showing his weakness here, but in his sixty years of life, he had done nothing but be consistent with the sword. So fighting until the end was the best thing he could do.</p>
<p>He forced his heavy, drooping eyes to open, and he pushed himself up to regain the senses in his dull body.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry asked.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas’s attack was truly terrifying. He was able to win because of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art’s middle form, but Count Nicholas was by far the best he had ever fought.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t met Butler and if he hadn’t had a year of imaginary training then Roman Dmitry wouldn’t have been safe going against the roaring flame.</p>
<p>And finally, the winner was him. Breaking through the flames, he stepped on the greatest sword of Cairo.</p>
<p>The Count smiled.</p>
<p>“… why would you ask that? Isn’t it natural? I am the First Sword of Cairo, and even though I have fallen down, my will hasn’t broken yet.”</p>
<p>His voice kept losing its tone. His defeat wasn’t pretty. Count Nicholas was stained in blood and unlike his name, he looked pitiful.</p>
<p>But what could be done? If his sword was broken, he, who wanted to show his will, was also broken.</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He kicked the ground but his movement was slow. As he ran, blood was dripping on the ground and it looked like he would collapse anytime.</p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>‘Richard Nicholas.’</p>
<p>The light of Cairo was such a wonderful man. He would not kill him, however, the times were changing and he wasn’t going to show him mercy.</p>
<p>Roman sent him a message. At the words Roman sent him through mana, the Count ran to Roman with wide eyes.</p>
<p>And at that moment…..</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The sword cut right through his chest, and blood splattered. Count Nicholas’s eyes lost focus, and he collapsed as he was charging.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>The First Sword of Cairo.</p>
<p>It was the end of a giant who ruled an era.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the end of a long journey. Looking at Count Nicholas stained with blood, Willas spoke in a trembling voice,</p>
<p>“… with this, Roman Dmitry is now the number one in the Cairo Kingdom.”</p>
<p>No one cheered at the shocking results. The match was too much, as everyone stared dumbfounded at the two.</p>
<p>Willas also couldn’t hide his shock. Even as someone who genuinely enjoyed such matches, this result was too shocking.</p>
<p>‘This is absurd.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s limit was higher. The Valhalla Empire was keeping an eye on him because of his rapid growth and boundless talent. They admired the way he defeated Cairo’s rankers from the 99th to the 2nd.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to admit Roman’s skills, but they didn’t think he could defeat Count Nicholas. According to the information from Valhalla, the Count was stronger than he was five years ago. And no matter how much Roman Dmitry tried, it would be impossible to catch up with him.</p>
<p>But Roman won with overwhelming strength.</p>
<p>Even when Willas witnessed the head-to-head fight unfold, he was not sure what had happened, but that the match just ended.</p>
<p>‘Did we underestimate Roman Dmitry? No, that’s not the problem. No matter how much we thought Roman’s limits were, the monster keeps surpassing them. Well, a monster appeared in the Cairo Kingdom. Roman Dmitry is a person who would have caused a great stir if he had been born in Valhalla.’</p>
<p>His heart pounded. Count Nicholas was someone who didn’t have a high rank in Valhalla. But Roman was someone they had to keep tabs on, especially when he was still in his mid-20s.</p>
<p>“The challenges for the Ranking Matches end now.”</p>
<p>He hastily left that place. The results? They didn’t matter anymore. It was time for him to contact his home nation since he had to relay what happened in Cairo.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is no longer a target we can leave alone. If he adheres to this attitude of not wanting to choose a side…’</p>
<p>Death. If they couldn’t have him as an ally, then Roman’s existence couldn’t be spared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the end of the fight, Roman headed to the palace. It was time to be recognized for defeating Count Nicholas and to announce that he was now the first and best sword in Cairo. But on the way to the palace, a group blocked Roman’s path.</p>
<p>“… Roman Dmitry. I never thought you would defeat Count Nicholas.”</p>
<p>It was Marquis Benedict. He and the nobles appeared in groups. Troops from each allied family filled the streets and even normal people hid at this force.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was unusual. Marquis Benedict who used to gaze at Roman with loving eyes was now showing a cold face.</p>
<p>“As I watched Count Nicholas collapse, I had a complicated thought. Was I stupid for not expecting it, or have you been hiding your power on purpose all this time? And I thought it was the latter.”</p>
<p>For now, Marquis Benedict believed he could still control Roman Dmitry. Roman’s power wasn’t that great, so even after giving him a year, he didn’t worry much about him.</p>
<p>But as a result, Count Nicholas collapsed. In addition, the Dmitry family formed a coalition in the northeast, and Roman Dmitry proved to be stronger than Count Nicholas whom the nobles were wary of.</p>
<p>This was simply not an acceptable result. What he believed he could control was only revealing his power now. This was flustering.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a fox. He didn’t know if this was true but he didn’t think Roman was the type to make such a joke.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry didn’t need a year to prepare himself. With the justification to prepare for the Public Ranking, he must have used that time to reorganize the Dmitry family. Roman Dmitry had known he could handle me from the beginning. Even so, I firmly believed that Roman Dmitry had no choice but to follow my words. And thinking that he is just a fool from the outskirts was my mistake.’</p>
<p>It was different now that Roman Dmitry gained strength. It would no longer be impossible for Roman to oppose them if he put his mind to it.</p>
<p>And because of that, he called for the troops of their faction. Even if Cairo was under the rule of the royal family, the guards would still open the gates for them.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“One year ago. You said you would choose after the rankings are over. Tell us your choice now. Will you follow me and the nobles or make a different choice? If you chose the former I will accept you but if it is the latter, you will have to pay for what you have received from me.”</p>
<p>The moments of acceptance returned with malice.</p>
<p>And Marquis Benedict continued in a determined voice,</p>
<p>“Choose. What is your decision?”</p>
<p>The moment to make a choice has finally arrived.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the same in Baek Joong-hyuk’s life. As he struggled to live at one point, he had to make a choice.</p>
<p>“Joong-hyuk. I will become the leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect. I have always treated you as my brother. But from now on, your choice will determine our relationship, so you need to choose. Will you enjoy wealth and honor by my side for the rest of your life or will you choose to be my enemy until the end?”</p>
<p>On that day, Baek Ho-yeol, the Great Young Lord of the sect, appeared with a power capable to stain the ground as dark as the night sky.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t a matter of making a simple choice. With Baek Joong-hyuk proving his worth and being discussed as the successor to the new position of Heavenly Demon, Baek Ho-yeol wouldn’t allow Baek Joong-hyuk to grow. And there were their other brothers too.</p>
<p>At first, the people who were fighting for the same position made the choice to surrender to Baek Ho-yeol.</p>
<p>‘What is the choice for me?’</p>
<p>His life was full of struggles and every second was hell. He could never sleep peacefully and many of those who followed him were killed because they were loyal to him.</p>
<p>Every time he struggled, he remembered the words and actions of the people who looked at him and he cursed his fate, wanting to end it all.</p>
<p>But the moment he would hold Baek Ho-yeol’s hand, life would be convenient. He wouldn’t have to struggle, and he’d be able to sleep without worrying about people trying to kill him. But….</p>
<p>“Hyung. I am sorry but I am a person who cannot live for others.”</p>
<p>When he was at the bottom position, Baek Joong-hyuk started his struggle by smashing the head of a boy with a stone.</p>
<p>Kill, kill, kill, and more killing.</p>
<p>If anyone looked down on him, tried to rise higher than him, or even tried to look at him, he would hurt them and emerge as the winner.</p>
<p>His nature would never change. The beast which had tasted blood couldn’t bow its head even if it meant death.</p>
<p>Baek Ho-yeol had a cold expression on his face. And as he took a step back, his men rushed for Baek Joong-hyuk.</p>
<p>On a night with a full moon, Baek Joong-hyuk was drenched in blood. Despite quenching his thirst with blood, the shadow of death was close by.</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk slashed the enemies who rushed at him.</p>
<p>Finally, as Baek Ho-yeol looked up at him with a shocked look on his face, Baek Joon-hyuk cut his head off.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>And now….</p>
<p>“I get what you mean.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry looked at Marquis Benedict and the people behind him. This situation reminded him so much about his previous life and this made him smile.</p>
<p>“But you see. I don’t think I can live for others. That is my choice.”</p>
<p>At those words, Marquis Benedict’s expression twisted horribly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 170 - Purge (1)</p>
<p>As expected, Roman Dmitry had no intention of swearing his allegiance from the start. The doubts started when he spoke about declaring his choice after the Ranking Matches.</p>
<p>“Stupid brat.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict smiled.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry, the new number one ranker, was strong. But even though he was qualified to lead Cairo’s new future, he made a fatal mistake by being intoxicated with his victory. The land he was in now was Cairos. And if he had hidden in the Dmitry estate, then they might not have had the chance to attack him, but he opened up Pandora’s box.</p>
<p><em>Clack! Clack!</em></p>
<p>The nobles’ troops surrounded the area and the sound of iron moving could be heard.</p>
<p>Breaking the silence, Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“From now on, I speak in the name of the head of the Central Government, Marquis Benedict. In the past few years, the Dmitry family has shown a pattern of indiscriminately attacking the troops in the surrounding areas, including the Barco and the Douglas family. Cairo is in a warring state and a civil war is forbidden in a situation where foreign troops might invade it anytime, yet for the sake of their own power, the Dmitry family committed such an unforgivable act. Therefore, in order to ensure a post-war investigation into this matter, I will arrest Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>His voice boomed.</p>
<p>Barco and Douglas were trampled on by Roman. There were no problems with the process.</p>
<p>Barco had a fight with Lawrence, and Roman, who was somehow involved because of his betrothal, had a reason to help them, and Douglas was no different.</p>
<p>As Douglas brought the families from the north, the strife escalated, and the Dmitry family, a powerful family in the northeast, couldn’t stand still.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, if you wear it on your nose, it is a nose ring, and if you wear it on your ears, it is an earring. [TL/N: A Korean saying that means things are how we interpret them to be.] It was just a play on words.</p>
<p>In reality, there was no problem, but Marquis Benedict used trivial excuses to arrest Roman.</p>
<p>“The Central Government is an organization that obeys the orders of His Majesty, the King. The rule on rebellion was violated according to His Majesty’s will, and so the Dmitry family will be punished for it. So go ahead and take him. If you cooperate with the investigation, you can prove that the Dmitry family is not guilty.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict laughed. As the strongest living power, the Central Government could suppress Roman with just words. No matter how strong Roman Dmitry was, this wasn’t something he could get away with, and responding meekly was all he could do.</p>
<p>The Marquis would make sure to cut Roman down so he couldn’t go on a rampage later. But if he didn’t respond nicely to this arrest, it would no longer be a fight between him and the Dmitry family but a fight against the power structure of Cairo and Dmitry.</p>
<p>This was a clever attempt. Marquis Benedict used his power to show a reality that Roman Dmitry couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>‘You should have just listened to me. If you had held my hand, you would have been able to live your life with a powerful person in Cairo and hold power, but from the moment you chose the middle ground, you were not allowed to live. Roman Dmitry, you surely are an existence with too many needs. Before you even return to Dmitry and establish a force of your own, the power you hold will be destroyed so you can never oppose me.’</p>
<p>It was a straightforward decision. They went after Roman Dmitry when he was weak after defeating Count Nicholas. But if he had sworn allegiance, maybe Marquis Benedict would have just tried to capture him.</p>
<p>Being the leader of the nobles was Marquis Benedict’s true face. And without his brutal and daring executions, the nobles would have never gotten such a hold in Cairo.</p>
<p><em>Glance.</em></p>
<p>He focused on the noble troops that approached Roman. Now that they have tied the hands and feet of Roman Dmitry, they are sure he is going to bow down. But…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>“This bastard!”</p>
<p>Blood splattered. A knight staggered and collapsed. Roman Dmitry proudly cut down Marquis Benedict’s knight.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s expression stiffened. No, he didn’t even think he would choose to protest. Rebellion was a road of ruin for Dmitry. And above all, the nobles mobilized their best troops, so Roman Dmitry chose the worst option.</p>
<p>“… are you going to rebel?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll make myself clear. Marquis Benedict, it’s not a rebellion against the King, but one against you.”</p>
<p>Roman smiled. Shaking the blood off his sword, he looked around.</p>
<p>“Cairos is the land of the King. Unless the nation is in danger of ruin, the soldiers from the nobles’ families cannot send troops that exceed a certain number to Cairos for any cause. But to me, it seems like you have exceeded the number. Marquis Benedict, could it be that you are the one intending to rebel?”</p>
<p>“You cheeky bastard!”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s face turned red. How dare he? He didn’t think that his plan of rebellion would be used against him. Not only did he use words indicating he was the enemy, but he also cut his own men down, yet Marquis Benedict cannot show his anger now. His name was trampled on and whoever wins, one of them should see the end.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“The Central Government is the center of Cairo. That is why it is called the Central Government and all our decisions reflect those of the King. And what? We are planning a rebellion? Hahaha! You are mad enough to deny yours. You cut down the servant who obeys the orders of the King. This is a rebellion, and Dmitry will perish due to your actions.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Punish the traitor!”</p>
<p>The nobles raised their voices, and the situation changed as they were sure of their win. A battle within Cairos would ensue, and Roman would be outnumbered.</p>
<p>But he had already expected it. Roman knew from the moment Marquis Benedict blocked his path that a fight would happen.</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict. It is up to His Majesty to decide who is right. Therefore, from now on, I intend to dispose of the trash in Cairo that plotted the rebellion. After everything is sorted out, I will be judged by the King of Cairo directly and not by the ones who mocked the will of the royal family.”</p>
<p>He moved the same way as his opponent.</p>
<p>Staring at Marquis Benedict who looked shocked, Roman said,</p>
<p>“Chris. Kevin, open up the path.”</p>
<p>At those words, the two swordsmen, who were waiting for his order, rushed forward.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At a glance, there were more than a few hundred troops. And even though they had filled up the streets, Chris and Kevin rushed ahead at the same time as if they were waiting.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“Stop them… <em>Kuak!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>It all started with Kevin. Kevin threw himself onto the opponents and decapitated the knight who was taking the lead. The knight kneeled down with blood spurting, and Kevin moved to slaughter the others.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The knights began to raise their auras and collectively attacked Kevin, but he was now an animal moving on instinct. And….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The enemies continued to die. The screams continued, and Kevin brutally slaughtered the men moving towards him as if he were just doing regular training. It was overwhelming to look at.</p>
<p>If Kevin handled the enemies like a demon soaked in blood, then Chris, who moved later, was like a solid wall.</p>
<p><em>Crush!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>The enemy was split in two with his sword. Chris was not in a hurry. There were plenty of enemies to deal with. The nobles’ forces were still under the illusion that they had the advantage, and now their bodies were piling up against Chris.</p>
<p>Even normal soldiers without aura died, and the enemies who faced Chris collapsed with blood splashing. He didn’t make any special moves, but just after exchanging a couple of clashes, all his opponents would look stained with shock.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>A knight of the noble family fell down. Although he had some reputation as an aura swordsman, he couldn’t withstand three hits against Chris. And…</p>
<p>“Cover Chris and Kevin.”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>His other men also started to attack. When Roman went to the capital, he didn’t bring many troops. He just brought twenty, including Chris and Kevin, but as the two moved first, the others rushed in to attack the opponents.</p>
<p>As Pooky and Volcan attacked the enemies by tearing off their limbs, Henderson and McBurney were calmly taking them down. They had no strategy for dealing with their opponents. They just ran ahead and made a path by making sure no one under Roman was hurt.</p>
<p>Last year, Roman took his time. He did not only focus on strengthening himself. He also prepared his people for future chaos. And this was the result. Roman’s men were slaughtering hundreds of enemies.</p>
<p>And the path was now open. The troops of the nobles rushed to block them, but with the corpses piling up, there was now a gap.</p>
<p>And between them….</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman walked forward.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict was in the front.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry stepped on the corpses and the puddles of blood and moved to his target.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“… t-these fucking insane bastards.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s expression turned pale. His eyes were spinning. He couldn’t comprehend the scene unfolding before his eyes.</p>
<p>‘How dare he attack the nobles of Cairo.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a madman. Attacking the nobles was no different from a rebellion, but he still did it even though he was aware of it.</p>
<p>“What should we do now?!”</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict!”</p>
<p>The nobles were all fear-struck. The atmosphere was strange. Hundreds of troops that were supposed to overwhelm one man and had the numerical advantage were being slaughtered one-sidedly by Roman.</p>
<p>Time was on the nobles’ side. If they could hold out, the guards of Cairo would arrive and attack the traitors, but the fight, which should have been slow, was moving at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>The path was open, and now Roman was walking towards them. Fear began to grip the heart of Marquis Benedict.</p>
<p>‘I was wrong. If I cannot suppress Roman Dmitry with rebellion, then it would be best to avoid him.’</p>
<p>His opponent was Roman Dmitry, who defeated Count Nicholas. There was no way they could defeat him in such small fights. And the power of the nobles was all about their mighty troops.</p>
<p>But once they would step back and make a new plan, they could trample on Roman Dmitry. No matter how much power they had, how could a single noble family withstand such an attack?</p>
<p>They had to take one step back for now and two steps forward later. So Marquis Benedict stepped back.</p>
<p>But even so, he shouted,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, you heinous traitor! Risk your lives and bring me the rebels! Regardless of status, anyone who brings his head will be promised a great future!”</p>
<p>“Everyone! Attack!”</p>
<p>The nobles shouted, and then they ran away, pushing their soldiers forward, while the nobles ran in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The soldiers were left on their own, and they knew how dangerous it was. However, they had to follow the orders they were given and act, even though they knew they would die.</p>
<p>“S-Stop!”</p>
<p>“This is Cairos! Do you think you can do this?”</p>
<p>The nobles’ troops blocked the path even as they were trembling in fear. They didn’t want to collapse now. They still seemed to believe that following the nobles was the right decision, and they tried to block Roman’s footsteps somehow while screaming threats.</p>
<p>In any case, disobeying their orders meant death. And if they were going to die either way, then it would be better to die fighting than be labeled as traitors.</p>
<p>Roman didn’t stop walking.</p>
<p>Right. He wasn’t in a hurry either. He ignored the nobles who began to flee and turned his attention to the soldiers in front of him.</p>
<p>“You have to do what you have to do. I, too, will do what I have to do.”</p>
<p>He raised his sword. It was now time to purge everything.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 171 - Purge (2)</p>
<p><em>“E-Eik!”</em></p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>Their fear has now reached the breaking point. The soldiers who were shouting and threatening Roman eventually chose to attack him first because the threats weren’t working.</p>
<p>The aura swordsmen rushed ahead. With dozens of people attacking together, they were under the delusion that they could defeat Roman Dmitry. And so…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The massacre began. Roman’s sword could be seen flashing, and the heads of the aura swordsmen flew in the air. Blood gushed out like a fountain everywhere. The soldiers tried to step back in fear, but Roman followed them right away and cut them down.</p>
<p>The whole place was mixed with bright red blood and deafening screams. Because they followed the nobles, they couldn’t avoid the devil, who was right in front of them.</p>
<p>“… Cairo’s Devil!”</p>
<p>“ACCK!”</p>
<p>The Hector Kingdom referred to Roman Dmitry as Cairo’s Devil on the Southern Front. The people of Cairo thought of it as an achievement that they called him that, but standing on the other side, they could see why he was called the devil.</p>
<p>It was truly overwhelming. As if proving the fact that he was the new number one ranker in Cairo, the aura swordsmen were all dying in vain, unable to attack.</p>
<p><em>Blood, blood, blood.</em></p>
<p>And the path opened. In the situation that was dotted red, there was no way to stop Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Actually, the power of the nobles wasn’t weak. But they made the mistake of using their power like this.</p>
<p>‘Marquis Benedict, you will fall into the abyss if you decide to hold onto your attachment to me until the very end.’</p>
<p>While challenging the Ranking Matches, Roman Dmitry rendered his opponents useless. People thought it was simply the price of the Ranking Matches, but Roman Dmitry expected a clash with the nobles too.</p>
<p>If he had killed Jayden, the 99th ranker, the nobles would have reacted negatively and sent their swordsmen, but he didn’t. However, if they step away from fighting Roman because of his strength, then people would consider him the strongest. And that was their mistake.</p>
<p>The core forces, including Oscar, all fought against him, yet they all collapsed without being able to stand. In particular, in Oscar’s case, whom he dealt with at the end, he deliberately used mana to destroy the path of his aura. And Marquis Benedict might not have been aware of this.</p>
<p>Roman’s most powerful sword would not simply render a body useless for a certain time, but it would end the life of a swordsman.</p>
<p>From the start until now, Roman Dmitry has been preparing for the clash against the nobles. Marquis Benedict judged the timing to be perfect, but the truth was that he was sticking his head into the jaws of a beast.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Knights stumbled and fell around him. The soldiers of the nobles couldn’t even bring themselves to run. They didn’t know if they even had a slight chance to win, so they didn’t rush into this meaningless death anymore.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman passed them and walked forward. Without even paying attention to the soldiers who were trembling in his presence, he just followed Marquis Benedict’s traces while holding his sword which was dripping with blood.</p>
<p>The soldiers just looked away because, if they didn’t, they wouldn’t have the confidence to accept this reality.</p>
<p>Roman moved slowly so his opponent could run away far enough. He headed in the direction where Marquis Benedict had disappeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The strongest living power in Cairo, Marquis Benedict, who didn’t even rush to meet the King, was now running with sweat over his face.</p>
<p>‘Fleeing to the palace is not a wise decision. If Roman Dmitry had planned a conspiracy with the King, I could possibly be executed without any resistance. So let’s head back to the estate. If I gather the troops there, I might be able to fully change this situation.’</p>
<p>That was the best decision. And Marquis Benedict was out of breath. The expensive jewelry on his body was falling to the ground, but he didn’t even look back at it.</p>
<p>And the nobles who were on his side were running after him. It was a rare sight to see such influential men running in a group.</p>
<p>Finally, Marquis Benedict arrived near the warp gate.</p>
<p>“<em>Ack, ack.</em> Connect the coordinates to my estate right now!”</p>
<p>“What happene….”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>There was no time to explain, so he slapped the soldier’s cheek.</p>
<p>“You bastard! Do you not know who I am?! If you have the time to question me, then hurry up and connect the coordinates to the Benedict Estate! If you are even a little late, I swear I will destroy the succeeding three generations of your family!”</p>
<p>“I-I understand!”</p>
<p>All of the soldiers turned pale at the threat and hurriedly connected the warp device. Everyone involved came out and activated the function of the warp gate. It was because only a few personnel were around and they had to do it fast.</p>
<p>The warp gate was known to take a lot of time, but they were able to finish it due to Marquis Benedict’s request. But the problem was that they couldn’t accommodate all the nobles around him.</p>
<p>When Marquis Benedict climbed the warp gate first, they followed him on board.</p>
<p>“You people, follow next!”</p>
<p>“Marquis!”</p>
<p>The faces of the nobles were pale. Warp gates had delays when functioning. It was impossible for all of them to escape now, and they would have to wait for the next turn, and the second usage would take a lot of time. But….</p>
<p><em>Wheik—</em></p>
<p>Marquis Benedict turned away from their earnest eyes.</p>
<p>A bright light shone, and then he disappeared.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>“Fucking bastard!”</p>
<p>The nobles cursed. Being the head of the nobles’ faction didn’t matter now. And so the nobles tried to run on foot, but then they went stiff.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry appeared.</p>
<p>Seeing him holding his blood-stained sword, one of the nobles said,</p>
<p>“… you, please be calm. If you kill all of us, what will you even get? I will die right here, but my family will do everything to get revenge on you. So let me live. If you do that, I will leave the nobles’ faction and follow the Dmitry family right this moment.”</p>
<p>In a desperate voice, the man kneeled down and acted as if he was giving up everything. And so did the others. Now that their escort troops were dead, it was best for them to beg for their lives.</p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“It is too late.”</p>
<p>The people who were here were those who appeared before him and planned on killing him. It was unknown what the situation would have been like had they maintained a passive stance, but they crossed a line they shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>He grabbed a noble by the head. There was no way for him to resist. The noble struggled, but he couldn’t do much against Roman.</p>
<p>Roman continued to grab his head as he looked at the others.</p>
<p>“If you drew the sword, shouldn’t you pay the price?”</p>
<p>And he cut his throat.</p>
<p>With the squeal of a pig, blood dripped down. And witnessing that made the nobles who were kneeling down pee themselves.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Cairo Royal Palace was in an uproar at the same time.</p>
<p>“A battle just broke out in the middle of the capital. It is presumed that Marquis Benedict, along with the nobles’ faction, is fighting against Roman Dmitry, and Roman Dmitry is reported to be massacring the nobles!”</p>
<p>“…W-What!”</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo was shocked. A massacre? It was unusual. Aside from the battle in the capital, he didn’t expect Roman Dmitry to draw his sword against Cairo’s most powerful man, Marquis Benedict.</p>
<p>He instantly felt an ominous feeling arise. A battle in the capital meant…</p>
<p>‘A rebellion?’</p>
<p>Maybe… maybe today was D-Day.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry defeated Count Nicholas. Because of the challenge for the Ranking Matches, Count Nicholas had to go alone, and the weapon of the royal’s faction collapsed like that. That only meant that the King was now a powerless man. If Roman Dmitry barges into the palace with ill intent, the rebellion will succeed.</p>
<p>The lieutenant of the Royal Knights, shouted with his neck turning red,</p>
<p>“Call the Royal Knights and the guards right now! We never know when the traitors will step into the palace! From now on, the safety of His Majesty will be our top priority!’</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The soldiers moved in order, with the palace in chaos. At the sudden rebellion, Daniel Cairo tried to breathe.</p>
<p>‘… could this be an unavoidable end?’</p>
<p>He knew that a rebellion would happen at some point. The King’s faction only held power with Count Nicholas by their side, and they didn’t have enough power to suppress the others. They were relying on one person until now.</p>
<p>Like a candle in a stormy night, if any faction revolted, he would be immediately deprived of the throne. It was a foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo’s heart was racing like crazy, but he tried to accept this situation calmly. And right then…</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! Roman Dmitry has arrived at the palace!”</p>
<p>The leader of the rebellion finally arrived.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The air was tense. The people in the royal family had expectations. They thought the Roman Dmitry would soon start a massacre as soon as he arrived, but he meekly followed the rules in the palace.</p>
<p>“Disarm!”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He took off his armor and put down his weapons.</p>
<p>The Royal Knights, who were hostile, guided him on the orders of the King. They didn’t let their guard down in the slightest. They were all aiming their swords, ready to attack Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman stopped and looked at Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>“I greet His Majesty, the King.”</p>
<p>“… let’s skip the troublesome process. I heard that there was an incident in the capital. Explain the entire thing.”</p>
<p>He immediately went to the main point. Be it a rebellion or not, Cairo was an important place for the royal family.</p>
<p>In the situation where people’s eyes were focused on him, Roman said with a blood-stained face,</p>
<p>“The situation started with Marquis Benedict’s demands. Right after the match ended, he came with his troops and urged me to follow the nobles’ faction. At that time, there were hundreds of troops blocking me, and it was clearly against the laws of Cairo, and I was considered a traitor for refusing his offer. It was unfair. Cairo follows His Majesty and not Marquis Benedict, so I couldn’t obey him.”</p>
<p>His voice was strong.</p>
<p>And as he expressed such strong emotions, he looked right at the King,</p>
<p>“And then blood was spilled. Even though I knew it was a problem, I couldn’t just kneel.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere turned cold.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Roman broke the rule in Cairo. They understood his justification, but the people of the royal faction couldn’t make a decision on how to respond.</p>
<p>And his words weren’t over. Roman revealed his reason for coming to the palace.</p>
<p>“From now on, I would like to make a proposal to His Majesty. If you can promise me what I want, as the sword of Cairo, the Dmitry family will suffocate the lives of the nobles and set Cairo’s chaotic power system in order.”</p>
<p>At those words, the people were shocked. The clash between Dmitry and the nobles was bringing an unexpected scenario for the royal faction.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 172 - Purge (3)</p>
<p>Roman’s proposal was unusual. Despite claiming to be the sword of Cairo, Roman Dmitry was offering a deal rather than loyalty to the royal family.</p>
<p>And so, Daniel Cairo wasn’t sure how to respond. He had always hoped that the nobles would collapse for the power struggle to stop, but he was afraid of what kind of price he would be asked for.</p>
<p>It was an expected reaction. Breaking through the silence, Roman said,</p>
<p>“When the Hector Kingdom crossed the border, he was on the Southern Front. The complacent defense system couldn’t stop the intentions of the Hector Kingdom, and the warp gate fell into the hands of the enemy without any resistance. At that time, do you know what I was thinking? While hiding in the mountains with the troops, I resented the Cairo family for not responding quickly. Although the defense was weak, if we had faced danger and learned to react quickly, the entire Southern Front wouldn’t have been taken.”</p>
<p>He rebuked their actions. Whether or not people showed a hint of response, he pointed out the fault of the royal family.</p>
<p>“I learned about the problems in the power system through what had happened. But has anything changed? No. Whenever Kronos makes a threatening move on the Western Front, the royal family just holds a meeting and watches the situation until the Central Government gives their approval. That is really horrible. Even though you know the issue, you just ultimately choose to stand by.”</p>
<p>The four factions were the problem in Cairo. Their relationship was like a magic bomb that couldn’t be touched, so the experience on the Southern Front didn’t fix it.</p>
<p>“Currently, the situation on the Salamander Continent is not serious. In a situation where war is on the verge of breaking out, if the Kronos Empire crosses the border, Cairo will not survive. Knowing that fact, how long will you just stand by? Someone has to wield the power. We need to unite the nation so that we have a systematic structure to deal with the events of the future. And I think it is right for Your Majesty to do it. Being the King, it is right for Your Majesty to hold the center and not Marquis Benedict, who speaks only for the nobles and pretends to be the King.”</p>
<p>His strong voice made the eyes of the people shake. Roman’s words about the King being the head made their hearts beat.</p>
<p>“I attacked Marquis Benedict for forcing me to make a choice. As Your Majesty, the King, you might doubt my intentions, but I want you to know that Dmitry just took a risky chance. The Dmitry family risked our lives and did this. And if Your Majesty ignores the chance we took, then the entire estate will have to face the consequences. Are you willing to stay on the sidelines until then? Or will you take advantage of the situation that Dmitry has given you?”</p>
<p>He passed over the decision to the King.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo who had been silent for a long time, asked,</p>
<p>“I have a question before I make my decision. In return for what you did, what does the Dmitry family want?”</p>
<p>It was important for him to know the promise Roman was talking about.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In his new life, what was his goal? Roman Dmitry wanted to rise to the peak, but that didn’t mean he was going to engulf Cairo to make his own empire.</p>
<p>For the goal that Roman wanted, Dmitry was enough. In order to control a huge land, there was no need to trample on the existing culture and traditions and tread on the path of slaughter.</p>
<p>In his past life, Baek Joong-hyuk’s conquest of Murim and his rise as the Heavenly Demon were different from this. If the beings who once commanded Murim wanted to take over Murim, then what Baek Joong-hyuk did was a mental submission.</p>
<p>The Forces of Justice, the Forces of Evil, and the others, continued their way of life like before, but when asked who was the one above Murim, then they would speak of Baek Joong-hyuk. He destroyed all the forces that tried to stop his conquest. And then he returned to the Hundred Thousand Mountains.</p>
<p>But rather than attempting to control a vast expanse of land, he made the people aware that Murim was a place under his complete control, and everyone had no choice but to support him. And from then on, Baek Joong-hyuk became a sanctuary.</p>
<p>The forces of Murim continued to fight each other, but they never dared to get close to Baek Joong-hyuk. And as such, Murim had achieved the age of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>If one looked at history, Murim always faced a crisis due to the beings that had dangerous thoughts. However, when Baek Joong-hyuk was alive, he held a certain role, as he became the center for making people abandon any potentially dangerous thoughts they might be having.</p>
<p>And that was the Murim of Baek Joong-hyuk. It wasn’t an empire in the sense that he was exploiting people and receiving things from them, but it was a firm domination that perfectly lingered over the minds of the people.</p>
<p>And the life of Roman Dmitry wasn’t so different. Roman wanted to rise to the top, but it was different from how the Kronos Empire wanted to conquer lands and the continent.</p>
<p>‘I will be the Heavenly Demon in Dmitry. I do not wish for destruction as I rise to the top. The forces standing in my path will certainly be trampled on only when necessary. Cairo or anyone else will have to acknowledge my existence. And when everyone finally recognizes Dmitry as the best in the continent, I will return to Dmitry and find my own peace.’</p>
<p>He had a clear goal in mind. And now, in response to Daniel Cairo’s question, Roman Dmitry has revealed his purpose.</p>
<p>“I want independence in the northeastern region, including Dmitry. If Cairo’s northeastern area is recognized as a Duchy and is given the power to work independently, then Dmitry will do our best for Cairo since we have the same roots. It does not mean that we are asking to break away or become completely independent. We will move with Cairo, but we also want to build our own world.”</p>
<p>At first glance, his words sounded like a rebellion. Looking at Daniel Cairo’s shocked expression, Roman firmly drove the nail into the wall.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, my King. If you cannot do that, then make the best choice for Cairo according to you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The atmosphere cooled down at Roman’s words. If it was the choice of the King then it was acceptable, but the King’s faction wouldn’t like their King being given an order.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. This isn’t right.”</p>
<p>“You are right. Has there ever been a case in the world where the title of ‘Duchy’ was granted at the request of someone? Dmitry intends to take care of his own interests in the name of nobility. You cannot allow it.”</p>
<p>The royalists protested.</p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is right. There is no such thing. But are there other options? While those present remain silent despite the atrocities of the nobles, I’ve drawn my sword against them. I’ve shed blood, and from now on, I need to fully bear the consequences of going against them. I only want the right price for my sacrifice. The title of ‘Duchy’ needs to be given by Cairo, and Cairo and Dmitry will forever be the same community. All I want is the strength to stand against what lies ahead. If they act complacently as they did at the Southern Front at that time, then at least we as a Duchy can provide you with a solid defense.”</p>
<p>He drew the line that it wasn’t a rebellion. Although his intentions could be seen that way, Roman Dmitry didn’t intend to make it completely clear to them. That was the deal. If the northeast would fall apart, he knew he couldn’t just give positive hope to Cairo.</p>
<p>Finally, the choice was up to the King. As he fixed his gaze on him, Daniel Cairo was lost in thought.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean by this?’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. Even though he was surrounded by soldiers with weapons, he didn’t look scared. Rather, he was looking confident. But it wasn’t arrogance. Even if he gave the order to attack Roman, the Royal Knights couldn’t subdue him. From the moment he defeated Count Nicholas, Roman was an uncontrollable monster in Cairo.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry’s suggestion isn’t that wrong. I just watched and was unable to do anything as the power system in Cairo was being torn down. If it weren’t for Dmitry, I wouldn’t have even thought of fighting the nobles. However, if the Cairo royal family insists on our rights without a sacrifice, Dmitry will have a different line of thought from then on. Right after Dmitry defeats the nobles, they will not think much about rebellion. And if they have the power and justification, it will be enough. And knowing all of this, Roman Dmitry is giving me a chance to stand beside him.’</p>
<p>He faced the reality. Daniel Cairo was called a weak King, but he wasn’t an idiot who didn’t know the reality. The royal family had no power. And if he borrowed power from Dmitry to correct the mess in the kingdom, it wouldn’t be a bad thing.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry started something that the Cairo royal family couldn’t even dare to do. That alone puts Dmitry completely beyond Cairo’s control. And we need to choose now. Will we be content with the current power holders or will we give what we cannot have and bring Cairo into a new direction?’</p>
<p>He had already made the choice. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he didn’t need to think about it for long.</p>
<p>‘I always wanted to build my own kingdom. Even if Roman Dmitry has other intentions, it cannot be worse than losing my life after being swayed by the nobles who used me as a puppet. At least, Roman Dmitry spoke his honest thoughts. If that is the case, it would be best to make positive ties with Dmitry who has a clear path.’</p>
<p>He knew that this decision was a risky one. If he believed in Dmitry and worked with him, then he might die one fine day. But he was convinced after watching Roman. He believed that this man would surely finish what he had failed to do.</p>
<p>“I promise to you on the honor of the Cairo Royal family that if this issue is cleared, I will declare the northeastern area, including the Dmitry, as a Duchy and give the title of Duke to Baron Dmitry. So all you need to do is win. And be sure to punish Marquis Benedict, the traitor who disturbed the nation.”</p>
<p>The command was given.</p>
<p>It was the moment the puppet King finally made his own decision.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The nation had turned into a mess from the clash between the nobles and Dmitry. Count Denver, who sided with Valhalla, watched this from his home.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. What a scary guy.”</p>
<p>A series of surprises. He couldn’t hide his surprise that Roman was able to defeat Count Nicholas, but then he went straight for Marquis Benedict’s faction.</p>
<p>It was a situation with too many variables. Even if Roman Dmitry was able to defeat Count Nicholas, he never thought he would clash with the nobles.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry made the choice. Rather than choosing a side and relying on them, he intends to create an independent faction for the Dmitry Alliance. And as long as they are attacked by Marquis Benedict in the capital, Dmitry and the nobles cannot stop fighting until one side dies.’</p>
<p><em>Kiik.</em></p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair as he chuckled. Things were taking an extreme turn, but that wasn’t too bad for Valhalla.</p>
<p>‘According to the reports, Roman Dmitry went to the palace. I am not sure if the King had planned this in advance, but it can be interpreted as the King helping out Roman to fight the nobles. A confrontation between the King, Dmitry, and the nobles—it will be a fight worth seeing. After two sides fight to the death, then I will bring Valhalla to the scene to take advantage of it.’</p>
<p>The only risk factor was Gregory. He must be thinking the same thing as him, so the Kronos Empire must also be waiting for their chance.</p>
<p>He was excited. The Cairo Kingdom was in ruins. Rather than sacrificing his life for the kingdom he was in, he hoped to quickly dedicate it to the empire and receive a high-ranking position.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>“Lord! We have trouble!”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>It was a family knight.</p>
<p>As Count Denver frowned, the knight said,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry stormed the mansion with his troops. The atmosphere is not too good. We need to run… <em>kuak!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The body of the knight was thrown to the side.</p>
<p>And behind the door, a man appeared.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry slowly walked inside and looked at Count Denver, who was seated.</p>
<p>“Count Denver. From now on, you shall follow the command of the King.”</p>
<p>Count Denver was shocked.</p>
<p>At the start of his work, Roman Dmitry first chose to remove the wrong plants within the discord.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 173 - Purge (4)</p>
<p><em>Chak. Chak.</em></p>
<p>The soldiers surrounded Count Denver.</p>
<p>Seeing the royal guards follow Roman’s order, Count Denver couldn’t hide his shocked expression.</p>
<p>“… ‘It is the King’s order.’ What is that even supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>He looked at him with wide eyes. Looking at this situation, Roman Dmitry said in a cold voice,</p>
<p>“Count Denver. Evidence has been found against you about your liaising information with Valhalla about Cairo. To ascertain the truth of this, His Majesty has ordered your arrest, Count Denver. So accept the King’s order. If you try to do anything here, you will be judged for plotting rebellion and will be punished.”</p>
<p>“R-Rebellion!”</p>
<p>Count Denver was taken aback by those words.</p>
<p>Rebellion? It took his breath away. He knew things were unusual the moment he saw Roman Dmitry arrive, but he didn’t think he would speak of rebellion right from the start.</p>
<p>‘This is really dangerous. Everyone knows that I follow Valhalla. The royal family never even considered touching me, despite the fact that the evidence supporting it is abundant. But to arrest me right now after the clash with the nobles? The moment I comply with the King’s order, my limbs will be bound.’</p>
<p>His instincts were warning him not to follow him. He could respond to any situation without regard for the royal family, but if he, the head of the Valhalla faction, was taken away, he was likely to be held responsible for everything.</p>
<p>In an instant, his head began to work like a calculator. His skinny mouth couldn’t hide the nervousness he was feeling, but Count Denver reacted as calmly as he could.</p>
<p>“Y-You people! Do you realize what you are doing?”</p>
<p>He raised his voice to intentionally come out as angry to the royal guards.</p>
<p>“It is an open fact that I communicate with the Valhalla Empire. How dare you arrest me by calling this the King’s order! Go back and ask His Majesty if he can handle the aftereffects of this! If you attack me, Valhalla will not stand still.”</p>
<p>He was in the land of the enemy, so excuses would not work. So he needed to use any weapon he could. The reason why Count Denver was able to establish power in Cairo was all thanks to the name of Valhalla.</p>
<p>The soldiers were shocked.</p>
<p>But unlike them, who looked at each other, Roman didn’t waver.</p>
<p>“Count Denver. You need to be very careful of each word you speak from now on.”</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>“Lower your voice. It seems like you haven’t grasped the situation yet. The Cairo royal family started a war against the nobles. Civil war is bound to happen. In a situation where our lives are at risk fighting against the nobles, you will surely be waiting for the right time to make a profit from it. Fighting is meaningless as we are simply going to overpower the nobles. The traitors who are following Valhalla and Kronos—all of you will also have to be uprooted.”</p>
<p>“… insane bastard.”</p>
<p>The threats didn’t work. Count Denver reacted as expected. It was too obvious. But he didn’t know that Valhalla would be mentioned the moment he was cornered.</p>
<p>“The fate of Cairo is at stake in this fight. Valhalla? What will they do for us? Unlike Kronos, Valhalla has separate borders, and even if they storm into Cairo with their troops, we cannot stop what we have initiated. It is a chance that will never come again. And if we lose the battle, we’ll lose everything, so we will have to pay the price. Instead of allowing more rifts to form, it would be wise to resolve everything at once for Cairo’s future.”</p>
<p><em>Glance.</em></p>
<p>The signal was given, and the royal guards approached Count Denver.</p>
<p>“Count Denver. From now on, we will have a very nice and fun time.”</p>
<p>At Roman’s words, Count Denver had no choice but to sit down on the chair.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The plans were carried out right away. At the time when Count Denver’s house was being raided, Simon, the lieutenant commander of the Royal Knights, led the force to attack Count Gregory.</p>
<p>“These bastards! Do you think you will be fine with this? Do you think it will be alright?”</p>
<p>On the order to arrest, Count Gregory rebelled. He shouted and shook the soldiers off and looked at Simon with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>“Simon. You know what it means to touch me. The Kronos Empire borders Cairo. If Cairo is found to have attacked me, the empire will send troops as a warning. So judge wisely. Even if you don’t do much either, I don’t know how the Kronos Empire, which is eager to conquer the continent, will react, but they will use this as a justification to move.”</p>
<p>At that moment, all the soldiers went stiff. It was a warning they couldn’t ignore. At least Valhalla was far, but Kronos was right next to the borders.</p>
<p>‘Count Gregory is right. The Kronos Empire is not just a verbal threat to us but one which can actually attack us.’</p>
<p>It was dangerous. After stimulating a reason for Kronos to move, Cairo might be caught in a war. So Simon went into deep thought. He wasn’t sure if this was the right thing to do, but he couldn’t clear his mind of what Roman Dmitry had said to the King in the palace.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the King. You cannot look at the Kronos Empire in the same way anymore. The Kronos Empire crosses the borders of Cairo each year for no reason. Then what are you afraid of? If Kronos declares a war of conquest now, Cairo will never be able to escape it. Even if Cairo makes a decision and we get attacked by Kronos because of it, doesn’t it also happen to us each year? Then, it is much better to use this as a chance to clean up this land and their control over us. This is the only way for Cairo to survive in the future.”</p>
<p>Right. Because they always looked at Kronos, they never cared for Cairo. They occasionally crossed the borders, and Cairo’s soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>And during those times, what did Count Gregory do? He didn’t care. Even though the people of Kronos were slaughtering the people of Cairo, the land he was staying in, he continued to live like a noble.</p>
<p>His teeth clattered. Simon had colleagues who died among them, so he spent time with Count Nicholas and thought about what happened and the new reality of Cairo.</p>
<p>But a chance came. Roman Dmitry stated that he would be the one with blood on his hands in order for the others to be strong.</p>
<p>‘The Cairo Kingdom has crossed a river which we cannot go back from. If the beings that threaten the royal family are not completely cleaned out, they will come to destroy the kingdom from the inside, even before Kronos touches us. If so, sure. As Roman Dmiotry warned us, we cannot leave any variables behind.’</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. Seeing Count Gregory with a triumphant look on his face, he approached the man and pulled him by the hair. And….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>He hit his head on the ground, making Count Gregory scream. He tried to look up at Simon with a puzzled face, but Simon only pressed his head down once again.</p>
<p>“Shut up, you bastard! Anyway, you will be judged, and if Kronos crosses the border to save you, even if it is beyond my authority, I will cut off your head and hang it on a wall. So do not act out, because if you do, I will consider your actions as treason and kill you on the spot.”</p>
<p>Simon was finally letting go of his suppressed emotions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation was quickly sorted out, and both Count Gregory and Count Denver were arrested. And by issuing an alert to the borders, the soldiers began to stay alert, and the guards around the capital were keeping their eyes out. In addition, they contacted the nobles who followed the royal faction.</p>
<p>“The arrest of Count Gregory and Count Denver is a temporary measure. When the facts are checked and everything is sorted out, we will release them again.”</p>
<p>It was a necessary measure to prevent any unexpected movements from other nations. Of course, the nobles wouldn’t believe the words ‘temporary measure,’ but in fact, it wasn’t that important unless they believed it.</p>
<p>The nobles who followed the empires wouldn’t do anything unless the empires moved. No matter how much they cried out about their empires, weren’t they all still living in Cairo? And they would choose to cover their eyes and ears in a bloody civil war. The contact from the Cairo royal family would later provide them with excuses for their stay.</p>
<p>At that time, Roman Dmitry sorted things out and met with Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>“The chances of the empires moving right now are rather slim. Valhalla is far from the borders. They will have too many restrictions when sending their troops, and due to the recent dispute in the south, the Kronos Empire is a bit uneasy. Their priority isn’t Cairo. Even if we look at their troops in the south, it is more important for them to sort things out there than deal with Cairo.”</p>
<p>This plan wasn’t just about exploiting this opportunity. After assessing the situation on the continent, he decided that it was the best time to touch the nobles’ faction.</p>
<p>‘Amazing.’</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo was impressed. Roman Dmitry was such a great man. Despite the short amount of time, Roman Dmitry demonstrated bold action and incredible planning. But it was too early to be relieved by this.</p>
<p>“We are dealing with too many enemies in a short amount of time. Marquis Benedict from the nobles, Count Denver from the Valhalla faction, and Count Gregory from the Kronos faction—eliminating all of them will leave a huge vacuum in the kingdom. The Central Government was everything in Cairo. Getting rid of them is necessary for Cairo’s future, but not creating a vacuum is also essential.”</p>
<p>Cairo has been driven by the Central Government for too long. The vacancy those people would leave behind couldn’t be ignored, and it was possible that the nation would lose its function.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“We are aware of the dangers the civil war will bring us. But we only choose the best option. If the forces that divide Cairo are at their worst, then eliminating them is a risk we need to take. Because the lesser evil is what helps this nation. If we can end the civil war by eliminating the heads of each faction as quickly as possible, the confusion that Your Majesty has can be minimized to an extent.”</p>
<p>The worst scenario that he was thinking about wasn’t really the worst. And Daniel Cairo accepted that reality. Roman was right. From the moment the sword was drawn, there was no better opportunity than this for Cairo.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the Cairo royal family was moving fast, Marquis Benedict wasn’t standing still either.</p>
<p>“They are moving.”</p>
<p>Immediately after attacking him, Roman Dmitry visited the royal palace, and he heard the report that he had joined hands with the King. He was sure that he had done something he could never correct.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry showed his hostility by rejecting his proposal, and the King’s choice was to show support for Roman Dmitry’s move. Then, what was left was the war against the factions.</p>
<p>He knew that he would take the throne one day, but he didn’t think that the throne would be held this tightly.</p>
<p>“Cheeky bastard.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—he would never forgive that man. When he recalled the time he was about to attack him and his arrogance, Marquis Benedict gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>At that time, he was so pitiful. He struggled so that he could live, and he had to abandon his pride. But it was now a fight that would end with one of them dead.</p>
<p>As soon as Marquis Benedict arrived at his estate, he ordered the nobles to gather.</p>
<p>‘The nobles make up a vast majority of the power in Cairo. If we muster up enough forces from the nobles to push Cairo out of the way, even if Roman is holding hands with the King, there won’t be any problem. We need to show the consequences of trying to attack me. Right now, you might feel you are the strongest after defeating Count Nicholas but things in the world will never go your way.’</p>
<p>Within a week’s time or less, he would lead the troops and head for the capital. And the overwhelming numbers would bring him sure victory.</p>
<p>Things were going smoothly, and when the troops of the nobles were responding to his summons, he received an unexpected report.</p>
<p>“Tell me again, what was that?”</p>
<p>His voice boiled with anger. Just now, the report that the subordinate gave was very hard to comprehend.</p>
<p>And the subordinate felt scared. Frightened by Marquis Benedict’s angry tone, he spoke slowly about what he had heard.</p>
<p>“… Count Fabius. He sent an answer saying that he would not comply with the summons.”</p>
<p>It was a clear refusal. And hearing those words hurt Marquis Benedict’s heart.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 174 - Purge (5)</p>
<p>A few days ago, the nobles’ faction’s decision to attack Roman Dmitry left Count Fabius in concern.</p>
<p>“… Umm.”</p>
<p>No matter how much he thought about it, the balance just didn’t seem right. Roman Dmitry, the hero of Cairo defeated the rankers from the 99th to the top ranker, Nicholas, without even being hit once.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said that if Roman Dmitry rejected the proposal to side with him, then he would be forced to make a choice right there, but in reality, it didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>‘I experienced what Roman Dmitry was truly like on the Southern Front. Even if the nobles summoned an army-sized force, would they really be able to subdue Roman Dmitry by force? Impossible, that would never happen. Marquis Benedict thinks that right after the Ranking Matches ends, it will be his chance, but in fact, defeating Count Nicholas means that Roman Dmitry is a lot stronger than he was one year ago. The monster who defeated Butler and opened the gates of the Southern Front must have reached a level that one wouldn’t dare touch now.’</p>
<p>A year ago, Count Fabius was on the Southern Front. When the other nobles were deliberating, he himself went there and experienced what a battlefield was like.</p>
<p>Roman’s power was electrifying for him. It was great that he walked alone and defeated Butler, but the sight of him slaughtering numerous people and opening up the gates made him always think that the devil had descended into the world of humans.</p>
<p>The memories of that time were etched in his mind. Count Fabius actively insisted on recruiting Roman Dmitry, and his thoughts weren’t different now.</p>
<p>And they planned to subject Roman Dmitry to pressure? Just the thought of antagonizing him was unthinkable for Count Fabius.</p>
<p>‘The question is, if the word rebellion comes up, will Roman Dmitry just surrender? The guy never kneels to anyone. People are so sure that he will not make the decision to draw his sword in Cairos, but if he was a man running on common sense, he would have chosen to flee the Southern Front when it was captured.’</p>
<p>So it was now a matter of choice and free will. On the day of the confrontation, if the troops weren’t mobilized, he would be pushed out of the faction. And if Roman Dmitry surrendered or was defeated, then Count Fabius would have to face the consequences.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just about the collapse of his fame and name. Marquis Benedict was the type of man who drew the line, so he would surely go after Count Fabius for what he did.</p>
<p>So he had to think about what was right. It wouldn’t end with just one fight, but there’s a chance it would turn into a war between Dmitry and the nobles’ faction. Finally…</p>
<p>‘Logic cannot determine which side is correct. What is certain is that, since I served Marquis Benedict, I know the strength of the nobles, but I can’t guess Roman Dmitry’s limit or full power. And I saw firsthand on the Southern Front how terrifying Roman Dmitry is as an enemy. Fabius. Fabius. The future of my family depends on my decision.’</p>
<p>And so he decided not to send his troops. When all the nobles sent their troops to the capital, he stayed silent on the pretext of being sick.</p>
<p>And on the day of the final battle, Count Fabius, who didn’t move at all, received a call from the nobles.</p>
<p>[Count Fabius do you really think you can survive making that choice?]</p>
<p>[There isn’t a single person in the world who will believe your excuse of being sick. After the sun goes down today, Marquis Benedict will celebrate the death of a man named Count Fabius without care. It is not too late. Send your troops now.]</p>
<p>[You idiot. You normally behave well but at such an important time, you make such a stupid decision!]</p>
<p>Anxiety began to sink in, and he covered his eyes and ears.</p>
<p>And then Roman Dmitry and the nobles collided.</p>
<p>Count Fabius entrusted his fate to the heavens in his comfortable mansion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict immediately contacted Count Fabius. He couldn’t leave the existence that caused trouble within the nobles’ faction alone.</p>
<p><em>Pat.</em></p>
<p>The communication device was connected, and seeing Count Fabius’s face that appeared on the screen, Marquis Benedict let out his anger.</p>
<p>“Fabius, you are really insane. It isn’t enough that you disobeyed the nobles’ faction’s order and didn’t send your troops to Cairos, now what? Are you going to refuse the summons? Look me straight in the face and tell me. Is this your choice, Fabius?”</p>
<p>His voice trembled with anger.</p>
<p>The raccoon of Cairos. Even though he knew that the man was a turncoat, he liked how quick-witted he was, so he kept the man at his side, but now… he was betrayed.</p>
<p>And the fact that the raccoon made this decision and not some other noble was what offended Marquis Benedict—that quick-witted man turned away from him. Doesn’t that mean the nobles would be defeated?</p>
<p>And Count Fabius said,</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict. Let us be honest with each other about what happened. Didn’t your troops get slaughtered by Roman Dmitry in the battle at Cairos? That is the basis of my decision. Roman Dmitry killed all the powerful nobles during the Ranking Matches, and knowing that you would make such a decision, he drew his sword without hesitation. So how will you fight such a monster?]</p>
<p>“You dare do this, you bastard!”</p>
<p>[Ah fuck. Do you still not realize the situation?]</p>
<p>Count Fabius was serious. Just like Viscount Conrad, when he turned around, he clearly showed his attitude.</p>
<p>[I bet everything on Roman Dmitry. So do not look at me like I am a bastard who will still follow you and send my troops to Cairos because I won’t. And you need to accept the fact that I turned my back on you, clear? You probably think of me as a bastard, but what the hell, man? You even contacted me just to say nasty things.]</p>
<p>“… this choice. Are you sure you’re not going to regret it?”</p>
<p>[Regret my ass. If my choice is wrong, will there be anything worse than death?]</p>
<p>“Fabius. You are a traitor to the nobles. No matter what choice you make, do you think Roman Dmitry will use a traitor like you? Traitors remain traitors. If you still decide to stay on the path you have chosen until now but still help the nobles win, I will certainly reward you despite what you did.”</p>
<p>[No. Even if I am faithful to you until the end, you will abandon me without hesitation if you no longer need me, but not Roman Dmitry. Looking at how he accepted Viscount Conrad, he has the tolerance to accept even someone like me, depending on the situation. And haven’t you heard the rumors about him? How much he cares about his people? Even if I start out as a traitor, from now on, I will do anything to please him.]</p>
<p>From the past incidents, Count Fabius knew that the start was important. It was hard to survive against Roman Dmitry if you’d already shown hostility toward him. But if one hadn’t crossed that line, then it wasn’t impossible to change things like Viscount Conrad. So he didn’t send any of his troops, and he didn’t respond to Marquis Benedict and ignored his words.</p>
<p>Finally, Count Fabius smiled and said,</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict. The war starts right now. You don’t seem to know how things are going yet, but I am probably not going to be the only one who has refused your summons. Even then, to try and contact me angrily like this. It will only be a matter of time before the nobility falls.]</p>
<p>At those words, Marquis Benedict’s eyes widened. What did that mean?</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off.</p>
<p>And it didn’t take long for Marquis Benedict to confirm Fabius’s words.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The nobles were summoned, and Count Fabius was the only exception, but most of them expressed their intention to comply. However, suddenly, something unique happened.</p>
<p>[I, Marquis Valentino, will declare that I will support the Dmitry family.]</p>
<p>Valentino from the neutral forces moved. Since a tycoon in Cairo supported Dmitry, the surrounding families were unable to move their troops.</p>
<p>Recently, Valentino spent a fortune sweeping Cairo’s mercenaries. At that time, he made the excuse that he needed manpower in the process of running a company targeting the continent, but never once did he speak about an alliance with the Dmitry family.</p>
<p>And Count Fabius also exerted his strength. He thought that betrayal should be done at its best. Rather than simply relying on a new force with a change of heart, he ran hard so that Roman Dmitry could positively accept his existence. Thanks to this, the families that had a relationship with Count Fabius also changed their minds. And they decided to betray the nobles and follow Dmitry.</p>
<p>And in just a few days, the situation instantly turned around. Shortly after cutting off contact with Fabius, Marquis Benedict received a barrage of calls.</p>
<p>[… I am really sorry. Since we don’t know when Marquis Valentino will attack us, we cannot just send our troops. But still, l hope you know that this is for our best.]</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict. How should we go about this? If we move hastily, there is a chance that our estates will be robbed, and no matter how important the war against the royal faction is, we cannot let our families be in danger.]</p>
<p>[Sorry, but I decided to share the same thought as Count Fabius.]</p>
<p>He felt dizzy even before he tried to do anything. Marquis Benedict had no choice but to watch the power of the nobles diminish.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the Royal Palace Conference Room, the last meeting before their departure was held. Roman Dmitry took the lead and spoke,</p>
<p>“A few days ago, Count Fabius, a nobles’ faction member, announced his intention to follow us. He and several families have changed their minds, and even Marquis Valentino is supporting us, making it impossible for the nobles’ faction to come into full force against us. Now is the chance to wipe out the traitors once and for all.”</p>
<p>At the series of events, the people of the royal faction were shocked.</p>
<p>Count Fabius and Marquis Valentino—it wasn’t their abilities that shocked them, but the plan that was exclusively made by Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘If the King hadn’t accepted Roman Dmitry’s proposal, he might have succeeded in the plot only with Dmitry’s power. And if that happened, the flag of Cairo would have been burned down by the Dmitry family.’</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose. Dmitry’s potential was shocking.</p>
<p>And in the situation where the nobles were driven into a corner, Daniel Cairo asked,</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you want to confront the nobles head-on?”</p>
<p>“You are right. To be precise, it is likely going to be a siege war. If the nobles had responded normally to the call, they would have come straight to the capital, but due to a series of circumstances, they chose to reorganize their troops. We have no reason to give them any slack. We need to mobilize our troops and wipe out the rebels. We have to crush them down with overwhelming force so that no one makes the same mistake in the future.”</p>
<p>Everyone gulped at this—an all-out war. Everyone waited for Daniel Cairo to decide whether they would fight or not.</p>
<p>‘The force leading this war is Dmitry and not the royal faction.’</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo knew the truth. If they won the war, there was a high chance that the people would call Dmitry a kingmaker instead of acknowledging the royal faction’s growth. And as much as how concerning that was, Roman made the plan from start to end. Instead of clearing up the forces that had divided Cairo over the years, Dmitry might form a force huge enough to swallow the Cairo royal family at once. But he had no intention of rejecting them.</p>
<p>‘Dmitry made this decision for Cairo. Even if Dmitry grows beyond our control, we need to acknowledge their existence. It would have been impossible without Dmitry’s help in the first place. A coexistence with Dmitry, who at least treats me as a King, is better for Cairo than the rebellious forces that would sell their King. Cairo’s system has changed. And in order to not lose a possible meaningful existence in the future, we need to actively step out in times when sacrifices are needed. Just in case Roman Dmitry won’t feel it’s unfair, we will do our best to help him.’</p>
<p>And so he made the decision. With a dignified voice, Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“War is inevitable now. Keep in mind that the royal forces will do their best to assist Roman Dmitry and that his orders will be my will. Roman Dmitry, I entrust with you the control over this war.”</p>
<p>All eyes were on him, and Roman responded like a soldier,</p>
<p>“I will follow your order.”</p>
<p>The fuse for the war had been lit. From now on, it was time to slaughter the traitors.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 175 - For A Certain End (1)</p>
<p>The sun shone through the window. A middle-aged man, who was lying in an infirmary bed, struggled to open his eyes and looked out the window with blank eyes.</p>
<p>“… I am not dead.”</p>
<p>His voice was dry.</p>
<p>The man’s identity was Count Nicholas. His expression was slightly distorted at the belated pain, and he lowered his gaze to check the condition of his body. He was a mess. As if to prove how terrible his condition was, his entire upper body was covered in bandages.</p>
<p>‘Only the external wounds are serious. Roman Dmitry had no intention of killing me.’</p>
<p>That was the conclusion he reached after examining his body. The wound ran from his upper chest down to his pubic bone, but only the skin was cut, and there were no internal wounds.</p>
<p>It was clear that Dmitry had shown him mercy. Although he displayed a dramatic scene for those who were watching, this proved that Roman was sincere.</p>
<p>In his hazy memories, he remembered what Roman told him at the end,</p>
<p>“Do not worry about the aftermath. I have no intention of betraying Cairo.”</p>
<p>And right after hearing that, Count Nicholas was hit.</p>
<p>People thought that Count Nicholas had his eyes open when he sensed his impending death, but the truth and sincerity in Roman’s voice remained in his head.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand Roman Dmitry’s intentions. All this time, he made no contact with the Cairo royal family. Rather, he seemed to get along with other forces, such as Marquis Benedict. Roman Dmitry was the balance of this land. His decision to join the nobles meant that the royal faction without Count Nicholas had lost.</p>
<p>So he accepted the challenge of a Ranking Match. By defeating Roman Dmitry, he wanted to show how strong he was, but the result was a crushing defeat. People would think it was a fierce match, but Count Nicholas, who wielded the sword himself, knew that Roman Dmitry was stronger than him. Otherwise, it couldn’t have been so overwhelming in their first head-on confrontation.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry considered Count Nicholas’s intentions and never pushed him back until the end, as he constantly showed him mercy. And his defeat was an unfortunate result.</p>
<p>However, the fact that he was still alive and the words he heard at the end caused Count Nicholas to worry.</p>
<p>‘I need to understand what the situation is.’</p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>He got up.</p>
<p>Even though he still needed time to recover, for Count Nicholas, it was more important to understand the situation of the royal family than his safety.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Simon.</p>
<p>Seeing Count Nicholas look up at him, Simon looked like he would burst into tears at any moment.</p>
<p>“… all I was told was that the commander might die. I am…. am so fortunate.”</p>
<p>Count Nicholas was the sky for Simon.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas showed him a warm smile.</p>
<p>“You have suffered a lot all this time.”</p>
<p>“No. I just did what I had to do.”</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t led and become the center of the Royal Knights, the chaos in Cairo would have increased. I am so proud of you. Because of you, I was able to comfortably join the Ranking Matches.”</p>
<p>Half a year ago, he left the vacant post of lieutenant to Simon. People expressed their doubts about Simon’s skills, which couldn’t even touch a 4-star swordsman, but Count Nicholas thought that Simon was the right person.</p>
<p>The Royal Knights were the guardians of the royal family. In order to maintain an unwavering heart despite all kinds of desires, loyalty to the royal family was more important than sword skills.</p>
<p>And that was Simon. He was in his mid-40s, and even if his potential as a swordsman wasn’t that great, he was fit to hold the title of a Royal Knight.</p>
<p>And Count Nicholas said,</p>
<p>“Simon. Tell me what happened while I was unconscious.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Right after the commander collapsed…”</p>
<p>He started talking about the clash between the nobles and Roman Dmitry, and how Roman Dmitry went to the King and offered a deal and explained the process of the civil war. And during that time, he developed a sincere respect for Roman. Even though he was carrying out his work for a certain price, the process of how he was able to do it was truly admirable.</p>
<p>The disposition of the imperial factions and his plan to break the enemies’ plan with the support of a tycoon named Valentino. The royal faction held the upper hand. Just by bringing in one ally, Roman Dmitry and the royal faction were able to get so many others.</p>
<p>“… that is what happened. We are about to embark on the mission soon. The commander is Roman Dmitry, and we intend to immediately attack the nobles of Marquis Benedict’s faction.”</p>
<p>The explanation was over, and Count Nicholas was lost in thought. Roman Dmitry was the best swordsman Cairo ever had. Depending on the choice he made, the game of Cairo could somehow change, but Roman Dmitry gave up on glory and wealth as he sided with the King.</p>
<p>And he was extremely grateful for that. The fact that the monster he couldn’t handle didn’t abandon the royal family was something he felt thankful for.</p>
<p>In this war, if they lost, it was all over. Even if he couldn’t go to the battlefield with his current injury, he couldn’t just sit down either.</p>
<p>“Simon, take me to the place where the military meetings are being held. I need to work there.”</p>
<p>Emotions grew inside of him. There was a chance to set the kingdom right.</p>
<p>At this historic moment, he wanted to contribute even a little bit.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Finally, the moment of the decisive battle has arrived. Roman Dmitry prepared for the marching ceremony.</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>He wore a different outfit than usual. Roman, who was normally minimally armed because it interfered with his movements, was now fully armed, representing the royal family. His silver armor was engraved with the symbol of the royal family. And his white skin and black hair had a charm that made people turn their heads to look at him. Even from far away, you could see the people waiting for him.</p>
<p>And then there were the people of the royal faction, including King Daniel Cairo, and an unexpected person on the other side—Count Nicholas. He appeared with a wounded body.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry knew what it meant.</p>
<p>‘Count Nicholas is the symbol of the military. Showing up at the military parade even after losing to me in the match means that he completely entrusts the authority of the military to me. The King and Count Nicholas too. They haven’t yet lost their goodness despite the chaos the power system created.’</p>
<p>Roman might be attracted to their goodness in some way. If he followed the Marquis, he would have gotten the chance to devour Cairo, but he knew that his little desires wouldn’t be satisfied with just that. He hoped Cairo would play a similar role to the friendly relationship Baek Joong-hyuk had with the Emperor during the time he ruled Murim.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He took his place. The numerous troops looked up at Roman who also looked at them and calmly said,</p>
<p>“Cairo has been through a chaotic time. The nobles, including Marquis Benedict, are people who only care about their own interests rather than the safety of this nation, and due to their actions, Cairo was never given a peaceful life. We are going to punish those traitors. What will we get from a civil war that causes people born in the same place or lineage to kill each other and leave behind pain? Well, I promise to completely clean up the chaos in Cairo after this war is over. And…”</p>
<p>He drew his sword.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>Those who trembled with anxiety needed the conviction—the right one—to win.</p>
<p>“I will always be at the forefront of this war. So trust me and follow. If I open the way, you can follow and achieve victory.”</p>
<p>“Woahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Roman! Roman!”</p>
<p>“Roman! Roman!”</p>
<p>The people went insane. Cairo’s most terrifying presence and the words he said about fighting at the forefront made the people put their blind trust in him.</p>
<p>There was no turning back now.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>The battle for the fate of the nation has begun.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The response of the nobles’ faction was as expected. After gathering their troops at the Benedict estate, they held a meeting on how the royal family was moving.</p>
<p>“If they use a nearby warp gate, the army of the King will attack Benedict within a week at the earliest. Right now, the odds of an all-out war are slim. We have to lock the gates and look for a chance to turn things around while taking advantage of this place.”</p>
<p>Just as one noble said, the condition of the nobles wasn’t good. Even at first, he thought that with enough troops they could wipe out the royal family, but Marquis Valentino’s declaration and Count Fabius’s betrayal were fatal to them.</p>
<p>And aside from the raccoon of Cairo, they couldn’t figure out why Marquis Valentino changed his mind. He was a key presence among the nobles.</p>
<p>And Viscount Owen said,</p>
<p>“Marquis Valentino has always been neutral. In preparation for the problems that would arise from taking sides with one faction, he ended up drawing a line. And such a person openly supports Roman Dmitry. It means that the nobles are moving behind this new power, and in fact, no one can stop Roman Dmitry, who didn’t lose to a single ranker.”</p>
<p>All of them acknowledged it. Roman’s plan was too perfect. It was as if he attracted Marquis Valentino, and when he was told of the results of the Ranking Matches, the man must have been impressed.</p>
<p>However, the issue was that that person would be their enemy now. Hearing of his success on the Southern Front, no one thought he would declare an all-out war.</p>
<p>“Currently, the nobles’ faction is unable to properly use the strength we have. I think we need to accept the reality and take some damage in order to defeat Roman Dmitry and their army. Marquis Benedict, how about contacting Kronos and the nobles of Valhalla? They have no choice but to worry about the future with their leaders being held captive. If we offer them a suitable reward, they will surely not be able to refuse our offer.”</p>
<p>“… that isn’t a bad idea.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict nodded. With the exception of the royal faction, they always had the option of joining forces with the other two factions. If Gregory and Denver were in good health, they would have chosen to wait, but now they are not here.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict asked,</p>
<p>“How long will it take to appease them?”</p>
<p>“It should be at least fifteen days. It takes time to change the minds of those from the other factions, and it will take a good amount of time to assemble and bring them together. So we need to buy time for them to get here. While buying time, if we bring in support from others and try to attack from both sides like them, we can defeat Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>“I get it. I will entrust you with the full authority in that regard.”</p>
<p>“I accept your orders.”</p>
<p>Even with the new measures, the atmosphere wasn’t so hopeful. At the thought of a devil named Roman Dmitry arriving, the nobles couldn’t react positively.</p>
<p>The massacre in Cairos was one-sided. Hundreds of troops that were secretly brought were killed, and those who tried to stop Roman were brutally killed. And from what they heard, those who weren’t able to use the warp gate didn’t even get to surrender. They were killed right there.</p>
<p>Their mouths would go dry even now when they thought of how he cut off the heads of all those who knelt down and prayed.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“The war broke out suddenly, but we had been preparing for this war against the royals for a long time. Benedict is equipped with supplies and a perfect defense system, and with this amount of preparation, we can even withstand the Kronos Empire’s onslaught. So have no doubt that we will win. As always, after everything is sorted, our nobles’ faction will have the power in Cairo.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“We will do our best.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere changed as they realized that Marquis Benedict was right. Even though the flames of the war suddenly spread, that didn’t mean that they were unprepared for it. They were confident now. Time was on their side.</p>
<p>And they were convinced that if he led them while buying time, they would be able to destroy the royals. They believed in themselves that, as always, the nobles would come out victorious.</p>
<p>And a week later, Roman Dmitry’s army appeared in front of the Benedict Castle.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving in Benedict, Simon came over to him and asked,</p>
<p>“Commander. In preparation for the long-term battle, they seemed to have built a good stronghold.”</p>
<p>The walls of the Benedict Castle were high enough to be called forts. The battle wouldn’t end in a day or two, so Simon’s judgment was correct. But…</p>
<p>“No, speed is important in this war. The more time we give the nobles, the more options they will have. Therefore, we shall prepare for the first hit before establishing our positions.”</p>
<p>It was a bold decision. If they get hurt, the soldiers would have to spend more time carrying the heavy bodies and building camps. But…</p>
<p>“Felix, prepare for a siege.”</p>
<p>At Roman’s command, a robed man appeared. As for Simon, he looked back and forth between the robed man and Roman Dmitry with befuddled eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 176 - For A Certain End (2)</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>The army of Cairo was moving. The main frame for the launchers was moved with wheels, and the other parts were placed on a cart to be assembled later one by one.</p>
<p>The troops on the wall watched this scene. They had no idea what the kingdom’s army was up to, but they weren’t worried either.</p>
<p>“So is that a Flare?”</p>
<p>A guard of the Benedict Castle’s gate said. He was Cameron, the captain of the guards. The use of a Flare was essential for warfare when it came to a siege. And a powerful siege weapon would make the castle lose its advantage.</p>
<p>In a fight between ordinary nobles, the ones with more money would get a Flare, but a Flare would always be used in a civil war on a national level. Even at a glance, the kingdom’s army appeared to be planning to install up to five of them.</p>
<p>And after about two hours of installation, its firepower would be able to collapse the wall.</p>
<p>But Benedict was different.</p>
<p>‘Staying in Benedict Castle is one of the things we have been preparing for. By making a request to the Magic Tower, we have installed a strong Magic Defense on the walls of the Benedict Castle. It has the defensive power to withstand dozens of Flares, and it even has the ability to recover if it is replenished with enough mana stones, even if its durability is worn out. Cairo’s forces can never capture Benedict.’</p>
<p>Replacing the King was their ultimate goal as nobles. They never overdid it with the precarious power system, but they were steadily preparing for the rebellion over the years. The Magic Defense was just the start. The military training of the soldiers was also carried out steadily, and various options, such as Plan A and B in case of a rebellion, were calculated in advance.</p>
<p>Of course, they also considered what to do if the royal faction attacked first. They didn’t expect that the royal faction would form an alliance with Dmitry, but they also didn’t really think it would change things either. They had an impenetrable wall, and they were able to secure a lot of war materials. Cameron trusted Benedict.</p>
<p>Thinking that the soldiers might be scared, he raised his voice,</p>
<p>“You know that the commander of the army is Roman Dmitry. He is the Southern Front Devil and the best swordsman in Cairo, who has defeated Count Nicholas. But this is a war on a national scale. Even if he is strong, it means nothing if he cannot cross the walls of Benedict Castle, which have been installed with defensive magic by the Magic Tower. In the end, it means that he is just a mere human in front of these tall castle walls.”</p>
<p>Their anxieties were due to the existence of Roman Dmitry. As he reassured the people who looked nervous, Cameron gave them something to believe in.</p>
<p>“Trust me. The enemies will not be able to cross the walls, and the final victors will be our nobles.”</p>
<p>Because of Cameron’s confidence and basis for faith, everyone was feeling positive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The appearance of the individuals in robes caused everyone to become agitated.</p>
<p>“… who are they?”</p>
<p>“They seem to be up to something.”</p>
<p>Above the castle walls, the troops of the nobles seemed anxious. Their enemy’s unexpected movement gave them an ominous feeling, but they didn’t show it. The safest place was behind the walls, and because they were being protected by the Magic Defense on the walls, they didn’t have to be too anxious.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the individuals in robes, who had been preparing for a while, approached someone to see if the work was over.</p>
<p>“Team 1, preparations are complete.”</p>
<p>“Team 2, preparations are complete.”</p>
<p>These individuals in robes were the magicians from the Phoenix Magic Tower. Felix, who hid his face in a robe, recalled what Roman had told him a month ago.</p>
<p>“Once the Ranking Matches start, Dmitry cannot avoid being caught up in a war. At that time, I will intentionally push the enemy into a corner and start a siege. Felix, your role is to bring your people there to tear them down.”</p>
<p>A month ago, when everyone else was enjoying peace, Phoenix began to prepare for the war. On Roman’s orders, they were ready to risk their lives. The Phoenix Tower was revived thanks to Roman Dmitry, and they quickly found stability with his full support. It was truly the gift of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Phoenix Tower was ready to do anything for Roman Dmitry, and when the order for the siege was given, Felix and the other magicians all laughed for joy.</p>
<p>Magicians were the flowers of siege warfare, and they were given the best role. Now their goal was to pay back for the meals Dmitry had given them.</p>
<p>And Felix said,</p>
<p>“The Lord has done so much for us. Even silent beasts can recognize the goodness of their owners, but we haven’t done anything for our Lord. And finally, the time has come. The Lord has given us a mission that we excel at, and if we cannot do it right, then our existence has no meaning.”</p>
<p>His voice was heavy. Because of what they would do, people would die. However, the moment they would take a step into the battlefield, they had no thoughts of stepping back.</p>
<p>“Let’s show it to the enemies. How the Phoenix Magic Tower has been able to hold the position of the 13th Magic Tower on the continent.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Your orders will be executed.”</p>
<p>The wizards started to move. There were three of them for each launcher. They immediately started to generate mana, and the pattern engraved on the launcher reacted to it and emitted light.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>‘Commonly known Flares have limitations on their damage. If their Magic Defense was properly installed, then they would not break even with the Flares. But what if a magician can amplify the power of a Flare? Its attack power will exceed the limit and the defensive magic on their walls will break down because these are not regular Flares.’</p>
<p>Mana resonated, and the magicians continued. In particular, the Phoenix magicians were known to have mana with the fire attribute that perfectly harmonized with the Flares.</p>
<p><em>Bam.</em></p>
<p><em>Pung!</em></p>
<p><em>Pupupung!</em></p>
<p>The Flares were fired, and the fireballs hit the castle walls.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>They held a strong power. The soldiers screamed at the impact that shook the walls, and they looked at the captain of the guards with shocked faces. The man had told them that the walls had Magic Defense that couldn’t be broken down even with the Flares.</p>
<p>However, the tremendous shock they felt made it seem like they could destroy the castle walls all at once. Even those who didn’t know about the Magic Defense were now taking the situation more seriously.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>The attacks continued. Depending on the amount of mana the magicians generated, the flames caused explosions on similar levels.</p>
<p>The flowers of siege warfare—it was the power of magicians. And among the 13 Magic Towers, the Phoenix Magic Tower specialized in fire the most.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“Captain of the guards! The durability of our best Magic Defense is rapidly declining.”</p>
<p>“If things continue like this, the walls will not stand! Please give us your order!”</p>
<p>The reports kept coming in from all directions, and Cameron looked pale. He never imagined that a kingdom’s army would be able to mobilize magicians in such a large number.</p>
<p>‘The magicians who belong to the Magic Towers always stay neutral. In fights between nations, they sometimes lend their strength to the nation that supported them, but in cases such as civil wars, they never step forward. So who are they? I wouldn’t have cared if there were just one or two, but dozens of magicians are supporting the royal family. Even if the King himself went to secure magicians, this number of people makes no sense.’</p>
<p>He was shocked by the dozens of magicians. This was beyond normal. There has never been a case in the history of the continent’s Magic Towers where they have sent such a large number of people to fight in a foreign nation.</p>
<p>First, he had to solve the problem. As the attacks continued, Cameron shouted loudly,</p>
<p>“Activate the emergency defense system! Even if we have to use all the mana stones, make sure to protect the Magic Defense from losing its durability! Once the walls fall, there is no turning back! Mobilize the ballista right now and destroy the launchers!”</p>
<p>The flames went out. He gave a command that contradicted his words earlier. The war materials would run out quickly, but Cameron had no other options.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cameron wasn’t the only one surprised by the turn of events. Staring at the fire-breathing machines, Simon had a startled expression.</p>
<p>“… what the hell is this?”</p>
<p>Magicians—it was a power that even the Cairo royal family didn’t possess. However, they were very active in attacking the nobles, following Roman Dmitry’s orders. It made no sense.</p>
<p>How on earth did he appease the magicians?</p>
<p>The answer came from Chris.</p>
<p>“Not too long ago, the Phoenix Magic Tower came and settled in the Dmitry estate. In general, the Magic Towers claim to be neutral and do not intervene in civil wars, but the Phoenix Magic Tower belongs to a noble family now. If Dmitry decides to become the sword of Cairo, shouldn’t the Phoenix Magic Tower also help?”</p>
<p>At his blunt response, Simon was shocked. According to what Chris said, it meant that these magicians were from a Magic Tower that belonged to Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘The 13th Magic Tower. It lost its skills and was considered to have the lowest number of people, but it was called the best in the continent for its attacks and flames. A group that would be welcomed anywhere swore their allegiance to Dmitry.’</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose. What if Daniel Cairo rejected Dmitry’s offer? Then Dmitry could have taken down the nobles with the power of the magicians alone.</p>
<p>And if he had pointed his sword at the Cairo royal family, it was clear that the high walls alone would not be able to defend against Dmitry’s attacks.</p>
<p>The choice of the King was a godsend. If he hadn’t embraced Dmitry, they would have faced the monstrous Roman Dmitry and the magicians as enemies.</p>
<p>‘The heavens didn’t abandon Cairo. We made the right decision.’</p>
<p>He let out a sigh of relief. The more he saw the true face of Dmitry, the more Simon was convinced that the war would end in their victory.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sun went down. When the first battle was over, Cameron went to report the results with a miserable face.</p>
<p>“… in order to prevent the attack from the royal faction, we had no choice but to use 30% of the mana stones that we had prepared in advance. I apologize. But please consider the fact that the enemies have magicians. If we hadn’t acted quickly, the walls wouldn’t have lasted long and would have collapsed right away.”</p>
<p>In this meeting, none of the members of the nobles’ faction could blame Cameron. Didn’t they see it too? The nobles watching the situation clenched their hands whenever the flames on the castle’s walls exploded.</p>
<p>They were overwhelmed by the sight. Since they had never imagined the royals would have secured dozens of wizards, the anxiety about the walls collapsing spread to each of them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the attacks stopped. But just like Cameron’s miserable expression, no one could take it positively that they lasted one day.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“So how long will they last?”</p>
<p>“… our opponent has dozens of magicians. If they repeat the same attack with proper rest, then we will not be able to last more than ten days even if we replenish with the mana stones that we have.”</p>
<p>“The longest we can survive is ten days?”</p>
<p>It felt hopeless. Roman Dmitry’s strategy was too simple. As soon as he arrived in Benedict, he attempted an attack, and as soon as the mana of the magicians was exhausted, he retreated with his troops, and they would be able to get plenty of rest.</p>
<p>The nobles’ troops couldn’t let down their guards even for a moment against the attacks that could come at any time, but the royal faction did not seem to have any intention of attacking unreasonably.</p>
<p>Ten days like this—it was a completely different pace that favored the royals. While being attacked with such magic, the nobles would get tired, and they wouldn’t be able to stop the troops rushing in when the gates would collapse.</p>
<p>Their plan to appease the empires’ factions hasn’t brought any results yet. The process of appeasing them and assembling their troops would take time, but the movement of the royal faction was so fast and powerful.</p>
<p>Finally, there was just one person the nobles could trust.</p>
<p>“Viscount Owen. What happened to Baron Winston?”</p>
<p>“The troops have gathered, and they have arrived at the entrance in the northeast. The situation could still change. If Baron Winston captures the Dmitry estate, which is empty now, Roman Dmitry will not be able to attack us as he did today. And once that happens, we just need to buy time and bring in the empires’ factions.”</p>
<p>“What is the probability that the attack on the Dmitry estate will fail?”</p>
<p>“We will succeed. Isn’t Baron Winston the proud commander? With his skills, he can destroy the northeast within a day. The only variable is the possibility that there are magicians in Dmitry. However, considering that dozens of magicians have already participated in attacking Benedict Castle, it is almost impossible for them to have any more magicians. And even if that variable does happen, the probability that the result will change due to their presence is not very high.”</p>
<p>Think about it. The opponents were on the outskirts, and with Roman Dmitry away, who would stop their attack?</p>
<p>Not all of those who belonged to the nobles’ faction gathered at Benedict Castle. They split their forces into two, and some of them followed Baron Winston to Dmitry.</p>
<p>Fake in the west and hit in the east. Benedict wasn’t too surprised. After deliberately locking the castle and distracting them, he chose a clever strategy to rob the enemy’s main estate.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s eyes were sharp.</p>
<p>“Deliver this to Baron Winston. In this war, defeat is not allowed, and I will give you full control of everything that happens in the process of bringing down Dmitry, so I need us to be the victors in the end. The Cairo royal family is a sand castle waiting to fall, so if we can deal with Dmitry, then the army of the royal faction will be shaken.”</p>
<p>The nobles were convinced that within three days, the news of their victory would arrive, and then the real rebellion would begin.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 177 - For A Certain End (3)</p>
<p>At that time, as the nobles said, Baron Winston arrived in the Northeast. After ordering the soldiers to rest, he called for the captains to hold a meeting.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>And then he opened the map.</p>
<p>The lieutenant, who was appointed to one area, said,</p>
<p>“If we advance a little further from this area, we will find Count Adelian’s estate. And Adelian is a commercially developed city, so it isn’t quite used to military stuff, but the problem is we don’t have much time. According to what the main unit said, we have ten days here. We need to fight, but dealing with each enemy on the way to Dmitry will take up too much time.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. Ten days is a tight schedule. Even the march to Dmitry is tight.”</p>
<p>The captains looked concerned. When no one else could think of an answer, they all turned to Baron Winston.</p>
<p>Winston was the commander who served on the Western Front. He was a noble from the outskirts, but he joined the nobles’ faction since he was recognized for his skills in defeating the Kronos Empire’s attempts to invade the kingdom.</p>
<p>And after that, whenever there was a military-related fight, Marquis Benedict would always put him in charge.</p>
<p>He checked the map for a while. It was something he had confirmed before the dispatch because he wanted to be extra careful, considering that it was a battlefield.</p>
<p>“You people are right. Ten days from today, considering the travel time, pointless fights will only make things worse. Which means we have to minimize the fights and the distance… and the fastest way is to pass through these estates here.”</p>
<p><em>Tak. Tak. Tak.</em></p>
<p>He put three pins on the map—Adelian, Rollo, and Conrad. He already had a plan.</p>
<p>Baron Winston, who repeated the names of the three estates, looked at the captains and said,</p>
<p>“There are pro-Dmitry factions in the northeastern area. In the wake of the battle with the North, Dmitry carefully established the Dmitry alliance, but that doesn’t mean that they are already loyal. And Adelian, Rollo, and Conrad were the three estates that were not pro-Dmitry before.”</p>
<p>Adelian was neutral. Rollo and Conrad were from the Northeast Nobles’ Alliance. When Roman Dmitry held the tournament, Rollo and Conrad sent out their swordsmen.</p>
<p>Then there was a way.</p>
<p>“Adelian is a commercial place. They don’t want their link with the Central Government to be cut off, so they want to avoid any extreme situations. In the case of Baron Rollo and Viscount Conrad, there is a high chance that they still hate Dmitry now. Therefore, send a message to all three of them. What we want is not their cooperation. All we need is a way to get to our goal without any issues and an extension of time.”</p>
<p>Winston was clever. He made a decision that didn’t require the opponent to make extreme choices. While the opponents turned their gazes, the nobles turned around and moved as inconspicuously as possible.</p>
<p>It was a normal thing to happen in war. Even though he could be unconditionally discovered by the enemy’s scouts and attacked, if he managed to take down Dmitry with the help of those three nobles, then he would be fine.</p>
<p>The command was given, and the magic communication device was connected.</p>
<p>[We, the nobles’ faction, do not have any grudges against the nobles of the Northeast. All we want is Dmitry, so if you choose to turn your heads, we will reward you accordingly. Choose. If you want to fight to the death, the estate that reject this offer will be turned into a sea of fire.]</p>
<p>It was a proper warning. He didn’t think any more time was needed.</p>
<p>And one hour later, the three estates said that they would accept the proposal.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Three days have passed since then, and Baron Winston’s forces moved through the night. They passed Count Adelian’s estate before anyone knew, and their speed increased as they entered Baron Rollo’s estate.</p>
<p>And while moving, the lieutenant asked,
“… Commander. Do you trust the Northeastern nobles? If they had set a trap on purpose, we are likely to be attacked from all sides.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>He thought about the unknown variables. There was no way the commander of the Western Front hadn’t thought of that, so he said,</p>
<p>“First, we need to move quickly to lessen the risk. Even if this is a trap, they have been in a quandary since the moment they accepted our offer. The main unit said that most of Dmitry’s troops have joined the war. Then, the troops here are nothing more than ragtag. Do you think they can win against our elite troops?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Right, it’s impossible. The soldiers of the nobles’ faction had gone through the toughest training for rebellion. War means that we cannot deal with things like those written in books, and if the enemy attacks thinking we are trapped, then we are at an advantage. It is a golden opportunity. Originally, we were supposed to fight behind the walls. No matter how different the soldiers’ skills are, the other side will be the one taking the most damage. But what if the land is open on all sides like this? In a fight with troops from both sides, the Northeast will collapse under our force.”</p>
<p>He made this decision with betrayal in mind, as he didn’t trust his opponent. He used them since he needed them, but he had no intention of being careless.</p>
<p>A battlefield was always like that. Those who talked about romance and blindly believed in others would die without lasting even a year.</p>
<p>“There are not that many cities with warp gates in the Cairo Kingdom. And among them, Benedict and Adelian are included. And if troops come from Adelian, there is a way for us to deal with them and even seize the warp gate. If that happens, Dmitry will have a fire set on their feet.”</p>
<p>“… as expected.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant admired him. The man from the Western Front was so different.</p>
<p>The commander, who survived the battlefield of blood and death, chose the most appropriate way to destroy the opponent. Every choice he made was deliberate. The nobles were confident, and they planned on taking down Dmitry at once. But…</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>The night fell, and fire erupted from every direction. As expected, the lords of the Northeast betrayed them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Adelian, Rollo, and Conrad, the three lords, didn’t have to worry about anything.</p>
<p>Who was Roman Dmitry?</p>
<p>If they looked at his previous actions, they would see that he was the type of person who had his own ways of giving punishment and reward.</p>
<p>It was clear that the traitor would be destroyed no matter what excuse he made, and if they wanted to maintain their relationship with Dmitry, they needed to do this.</p>
<p>Then the choice was obvious. As soon as Baron Winston sent the offer, they contacted Dmitry and asked him how to deal with it.</p>
<p>[Open the way. Just lure them in and wipe them out.]</p>
<p>And now the alliance has come forward, with countless troops surrounding the enemies and flames that shone across the land.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>“Baron Winston. We have received reports that you are trying to coax the nobles here with the idea of attacking Dmitry. The nobles from Marquis Benedict’s faction are treasonous. If you surrender, your choice will be taken into account, and you will be given mercy. But if you rebel, you will be charged with rebellion like Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>It was Jonathan, the captain of the knights. Dmitry’s flag was fluttering behind him.</p>
<p>And at the sight of the enemies filling his vision, Baron Winston was shocked. The number of enemies was too great. He expected a good number, but it looked like all the troops from the Northeast had come here.</p>
<p>“… Commander.”</p>
<p>Baron Winston focused his eyes as he drew his sword. He wasn’t going to compromise now. Even if there were many enemies, he believed that the nobles’ elite troops could crush them.</p>
<p>“Stop talking nonsense! Marquis Benedict is not a traitor! That is just an accusation spread by Dmitry. Rather, I give you this proposal, if you surrender now, Marquis Benedict will accept you with great generosity, but the moment you show hostility…”</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>He raised his aura. There was no going back. They had already crossed a river too wide.</p>
<p>“We will kill all of you right here.”</p>
<p>He had a menacing power, but no one seemed to be shaken. Baron Winston was someone who had experienced battles countless times, and the people in the Northeast under Dmitry? They had only experienced Roman.</p>
<p>There were people who were also Roman’s enemies here. For those who had already experienced extreme terror in front of Roman, Baron Winston didn’t look like much.</p>
<p>In this precipitous situation, Jonathan finally made a decision.</p>
<p>“Knox. Please.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>A man stepped forward.</p>
<p>Even at that time, Baron Winston had no idea what Jonathan was planning.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Like the concerns of the nobles, the variables turned into reality.</p>
<p>Dmitry had magicians, even 5-circle ones too.</p>
<p>“Fire Cannon.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>The flame was strong. The moment Winston looked at them, the fire had already hit the nobles from their side.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik, wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ackkk!”</em></p>
<p>A strong flame was cast again. Hundreds of their soldiers were swept away at once as they were charred black. However, the soldiers nearby weren’t safe. They were also caught in the fire and were rolling on the ground in pain from their skin burning. It was just one spell, but the result was too strong.</p>
<p>Baron Winston, who witnessed it, could only shout,</p>
<p>“All attack!”</p>
<p>He already made the choice, and winning was the only way out. The magic of the magicians terrified the soldiers, but they still believed in their strength, but…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The results in front of his eyes were different from what he had expected. And when the troops faced each other, the soldiers from the nobles’ faction were slaughtered one-sidedly.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s men were slaughtering them all at once. And Baron Winston couldn’t accept this situation.</p>
<p>The ragtag soldiers of the frontier must have had crude skills, but Dmitry’s soldiers seemed like they didn’t lack any experience compared with the soldiers from the Western Front.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t know that last year, when Roman Dmitry gave those around him time to prepare, it didn’t just mean his own subordinates, like Chris, but all those related to Dmitry.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s soldiers learned to fight. Just like Roman’s men, they didn’t know how to handle mana, but they learned how to make their bodies strong. And this was the result of their intense training.</p>
<p>The more Roman Dmitry grew, the more the soldiers wanted to become stronger, and they all worked hard without taking any breaks. And as a result, they were totally different from a year ago. In order to kill one Dmitry soldier, at least ten of the nobles’ soldiers had to die.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p>‘This is insane.’</p>
<p>As Baron Winston tried to attack, an unknown knight blocked his path. And only then did he see the reality. They ignored the Northeastern’s skills and power, yet these people were sharper than them.</p>
<p>The nobles’ plans were all in Roman’s palms. The reason he attacked Benedict with his elite troops was that he knew that the other troops back home wouldn’t have any trouble.</p>
<p>However, Baron Winston was desperate now. To live up to Marquis Benedict’s expectations of him, he continued to shout for victory until the end, but he eventually died at the hands of Captain Jonathan.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>He had also learned the Asura technique, and being one step above Baron Winston, he killed him at once.</p>
<p>And that was all. On the fourth day after Dmitry attacked Benedict, Baron Winston’s troops had been defeated.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It’s been a week since the war started. It was as if they went back and forth between heaven and hell every day.</p>
<p>And in one morning, the nobles clenched their fists at the reply from an empire’s faction.</p>
<p>[We will join the nobles.]</p>
<p>It went as planned. If an empire’s faction joined them, then the situation could be changed.</p>
<p>But at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwaaang!</em></p>
<p>“We have bad news! A part of the wall has now collapsed. The repairs on the castle’s wall were being carried out, but it wasn’t easy because the kingdom’s troops were continuously attacking. Please give us an order. At this rate, we won’t be able to last long.”</p>
<p>The lights went off, and Marquis Benedict had a contorted face.</p>
<p>One week. It should have been just one week, and he could have managed to get the empires’ factions to join, so the walls shouldn’t be collapsing like this.</p>
<p>“Baron Winston? What happened to Baron Winston?”</p>
<p>“T-That…”</p>
<p>Viscount Owen was speechless. A few days ago, they had lost all contact with Baron Winston. According to the plan, there should have been immediate results, but word started to spread that contact wasn’t being established.</p>
<p>His stomach churned at this unforeseen situation.</p>
<p>At that moment, more despair struck them.</p>
<p>“We got a call from Baron Winston’s lieutenant! The army that attacked the Dmitry estate was annihilated! Baron Winston died on the spot, and the defeated soldiers had run away!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Defeat.</p>
<p>Only then did he realize it—the fact that there was a place lower than hell.</p>
<p>At this dark reality, Marquis Benedict’s mind sank into the abyss.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 178 - For A Certain End (4)</p>
<p>His head spun. Was it real or was it some kind of dream? Marquis Benedict, who enjoyed unparalleled power until fifteen days ago, looked ahead, shocked.</p>
<p>“Tell me the solution!”</p>
<p>“Solution? It is over. Baron Winston’s army has been annihilated, and the castle’s walls will fall down at any moment. Didn’t the imperial factions also suddenly cut off their contact with us? The only way to survive is to open the gates and surrender!”</p>
<p>“Surrender! You think that makes sense?!”</p>
<p>It was a mess. The people who had never raised their voices against Marquis Benedict were now furious and had red faces. It was truly a desperate situation. At one point in time, he thought that the nobles were the future of Cairo, but when he faced this crisis, he felt that they were the sandcastle of Cairo.</p>
<p>And it was at that moment when….</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>“Everyone stop! Now isn’t the time for this.”</p>
<p>It was Viscount Owen. Seeing him hit the table, the nobles gulped.</p>
<p>“As you all said, we are being driven to the edge right now. But surrendering is not possible. Even though it hasn’t been revealed outside, according to the information leaked from the northeastern region, Roman Dmitry was involved in Barco’s death. Not just that, even if we look at the steps he has taken until now, Roman Dmitry hasn’t shown any mercy to those who were hostile to him. It means that he is different from the weak King. And if we open the gates to surrender? Normal soldiers will be spared, but all the leaders here will be decapitated by that man.”</p>
<p>“… so what are we going to do? The mana stones maintaining the Magic Defense are running out.”</p>
<p>“Right. Two or three days at most, and during that time, we must reverse the situation.”</p>
<p>They turned to Marquis Benedict. Looking at him who was still shocked, Viscount Owen spoke in a firm voice,</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict. The imperial factions aren’t the only forces that can solve this. Why don’t we skip them and directly work with the empires?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“This is a fight that is over anyway. And instead of waiting to die here, it is more important to survive. Then the Kronos Empire will not refuse our offer. They have always wanted to use Cairo as the starting point for their conquest, so they will unconditionally accept our offer. Our last chance to convince the empire is when all of the leaders of the imperial faction are taken away.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s eyes came to life.</p>
<p>Not yet. The war wasn’t over yet. The castle hasn’t collapsed yet, and now was their last chance to get their hands on something good before it falls down.</p>
<p>The trouble was short-lived as they had made their decision.</p>
<p>“Contact Kronos right now. I will talk to them myself.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The magic communication device was connected right away.</p>
<p>When Baron Charlton, a member of Kronos’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, appeared on the screen, Marquis Benedict got straight to the point.</p>
<p>“I think you already realize our situation. Please save the nobles’ factions. If you help us destroy the royal family, we will pledge our allegiance to the Kronos Empire from now on and promise to be your vassals.”</p>
<p>There was no more pretense. When he lowered his head, he wasn’t acting like an idiot who lost his pride.</p>
<p>[… Hmm. I am sorry, but there are already forces following Kronos in Cairo. Isn’t it an open fact that it’s Count Gregory? If we want to choose a scarecrow to rule Cairo, then it will be Gregory for the work he has done until now and not you Marquis Benedict.]</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand. But the situation is different right now.”</p>
<p>And he spoke with some strength in his voice.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t persuade them, then they would die at the hands of that devil.</p>
<p>“The Cairo royal family has begun to purge people, with Roman Dmitry at the front. As a start, Count Gregory and Count Denver, who have followed the empires, were captured first. Do you think they will get out safely? The moment the nobles collapse, it is all over, and their lives will end. Roman Dmitry will take their lives and control Cairo, and then the empire will not be given the right to break through. So what I’m saying is, let’s use each other. If Kronos shows some mercy, the nobles will bring the royal family to their knees as people of the empire. Later on, when the conquest of the continent is declared, the Cairo Kingdom will be willing to sacrifice itself for Kronos.”</p>
<p>The continental conquest. It was a decision that required sacrifices. However, if Kronos becomes the winner, then only the soldiers would die, and the leaders would stay in power.</p>
<p>And in the end, Benedict put the kingdom up as collateral. For his own survival, Marquis Benedict didn’t hesitate to be a traitor.</p>
<p>“It is a choice that isn’t much different for the Kronos Empire. Gregory to Benedict. The only difference is the people who will give up their lives for the Kronos Empire, and the empire only needs to take the best ones into account.”</p>
<p>[You seem to be talking about yourself highly.]</p>
<p>Baron Charlton grinned.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict could see it. Actually, for the Kronos Empire, it wasn’t that important to invade the kingdom, which was as good as dead. They could come and take it whenever they wanted. It didn’t matter if it was Benedict or Gregory.</p>
<p>[Actually, we are quite disappointed that Count Gregory was caught this time. Although we have supported them until now, they haven’t been able to use the advantage they were given at all. So say it. What do you want Kronos to do for you?]</p>
<p>“Attack the Western Front.”</p>
<p>[Kukuku, did you just ask us to attack your own nation?]</p>
<p>“Yes. In return, only attack the first line. Just give a warning to the royal family as usual to prove that Kronos and the nobles have joined hands. If we show them an aggressive move on the Western Front, they will back down.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t much. Just the mere fact that Kronos has sided with the nobles would give them time to breathe. They would be able to bring in the imperial factions that have turned their heads to the nobles, and once the royal family is threatened, they will no longer attack Benedict.</p>
<p>And if that happens, the royal family would think that the troops in the West are beginning to capture the throne, so it felt like a reasonable plan.</p>
<p>Even during the conflict with the kingdom’s troops, attacking the Western Front wasn’t that difficult for Kronos.</p>
<p>[Fine. I will accept your offer.]</p>
<p>And so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accepted. It was such an easy matter that it didn’t require the Emperor’s mission. With Baron Charlton’s reply, the small nation of Cairo was going to fall into great chaos.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And twelve hours later, shortly after Kronos accepted the offer, the imperial army invaded the Western Front, and out of the three defense lines, two were pierced.</p>
<p>And unlike usual, the Cairo royal family also caught wind of their movement to attack the third line of defense.</p>
<p>Simon said,</p>
<p>“…. The Kronos Empire is currently regrouping and preparing to attack the third line of defense. Once they break through that line, they will come into Cairo’s estate. Your Majesty, we must somehow stop them at the Western Front.”</p>
<p>The attack was a sudden disaster for no reason. It could be criticized later on, but the disaster was happening right now. And right then…</p>
<p>“A communication request has come in from Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>They couldn’t refuse it. Since the movement of the empire was likely due to the nobles, Daniel Cairo connected the call, and he had a cold look on his face.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict was beyond the screen.</p>
<p>[It’s been a while, Your Majesty.]</p>
<p>“What is this? Regardless of your disadvantage, you are bringing an enemy empire into the fight!”</p>
<p>[We couldn’t help it. Roman Dmitry has put us under pressure to the point of death. Shouldn’t we at least live? Listen carefully now. The nobles joined hands with the Kronos Empire. For that reason, they attacked Cairo at the Western Front today and while you are trying to take down the Benedict Castle, they will make a mess of Cairo.]</p>
<p>His voice was strong. The person who was cornered was speaking with an arrogant voice.</p>
<p>[The Kronos Empire has always wanted the Cairo Kingdom, and this civil war gives them a good reason to capture Cairo. What do you think will change if Roman Dmitry takes Benedict Castle? You need to choose now. Promise to remain the puppet King that you are, and we will end this by amputating the limbs of the King. Well, we will spare the Royal Knights. And if you won’t be too greedy, then maybe Your Majesty the King will live a long life in Cairo. This is our last consideration for you.]</p>
<p>The seat of the King? It never mattered. No matter who was called the King, people knew that Marquis Benedict was the one controlling Cairo. And that was the way for him to live.</p>
<p>The offer to spare the King, rather than pushing the opponent to fight until death, would result in infighting with Dmitry, and that was what he aimed for. While throwing a choice at the indecisive King, he would put the nation into chaos.</p>
<p>[This is a problem that has ended since the moment Kronos stepped in. Your Highness. This is your last chance. Think carefully and make a wise decision.]</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off. Benedict’s face vanished at the one-sided conversation, and Daniel Cairo felt horrible.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Royal Palace Conference Room was silent. If they choose to fight, then the royal family would be destroyed, and if they choose the other option, the forces that followed the royal family, like Dmitry, would be killed.</p>
<p>It was a matter of choice. Marquis Benedict provoked infighting.</p>
<p>Benedict—he was once the King’s maternal uncle. The person who had the same blood as him had now pushed him to the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>‘My situation is truly miserable.’</p>
<p>The seat of the King—Daniel Cairo never wanted it. It was a reality that was hard to accept since he was born into royalty, and the power he held never meant anything. It was the puppet King’s reality.</p>
<p>With Roman Dmitry’s help, he tried to bring Cairo in the right direction, but Marquis Benedict dragged in a monster the nation couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>What if they had killed him without giving him a choice? Even if he died, Daniel Cairo would have accepted it.</p>
<p>‘I can survive if I abandon Dmitry.’</p>
<p>But what would it mean? If he was going to continue living like a puppet, he would have to move according to what others told him to do.</p>
<p>‘Even if Dmitry defeats the nobles, my power is not guaranteed. Dmitry is a force as strong as the royal family now, and I will stay as a puppet even then. I, Daniel Cairo, am destined to live as a puppet for others. If this is an unavoidable reality, then I want to make a choice for the kingdom, no matter what my life turns into.’</p>
<p>Benedict was a traitor who sold his country. Rather than surviving as his puppet, he at least wanted to see the world that Dmitry was going to show him.</p>
<p>He accepted the reality of his messy life. Even if he had no skills to change this weak nation into a strong one, he trusted and followed his values.</p>
<p>“Simon.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He had made a choice.</p>
<p>The Cairo royal family.</p>
<p>“Contact Roman Dmitry right now.”</p>
<p>Even if he was called a weak King and remained a puppet, he would never let himself be called a traitor.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 179 - For A Certain End (5)</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry appeared on the screen. As soon as the communication was connected, Daniel Cairo spoke about the situation.</p>
<p>“The nobles’ faction of Marquis Benedict held hands with Kronos. The Western Front has already collapsed until the second line of defense, and at this rate, it seems like it is only a matter of time before the third line of defense will collapse. You realize what this means. The moment the Kronos Empire invades Cairo’s territory, the chaos in Cairo will be further aggravated by the civil war. How should we proceed? Taking down Benedict’s nobles’ faction is important, but we cannot leave the Kronos Empire’s troops alone either.”</p>
<p>In the western part of Cairo, the people who lived there would be in danger. While they settled here to end the civil war, the Kronos Empire could do anything to them.</p>
<p>[If the civil war isn’t settled at once, it will drag on. Marquis Benedict knew this, which is why he brought in the Kronos Empire, and if we retreat now, we’d be going along with his plans.]</p>
<p>“It isn’t like I don’t realize that. However, Marquis Benedict abandoned the Cairo Kingdom. He no longer cares about what will happen to the kingdom, but as the King, I am unable to make a choice like him. They will probably lead this war by helping Kronos invade. And after a day or two, new terrors will come from the West and engulf the people in Cairo.”</p>
<p>It was a dilemma. The position of the kings and nobles was different. If he decided to abandon the people, then his role as the King was useless.</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict urged me to surrender. If I abandon the forces involved in this purge, I get to keep my life and my throne. I declined the offer. It’s not because of my greed to hold power but because I will not be able to avoid sacrificing the people if I become a vassal of Kronos. If so, I will ask this question. What is the most important thing that can help people now? The lives of those in the West also hold the same weight as those in the Capital. Then what should I tell them? Do I tell them to die until the civil war ends? Or would it be much better to set aside the civil war and push out the Kronos Empire now?”</p>
<p>The nobles had been defeated once. If he was satisfied with that and decided to turn his troops around, he could attack Kronos and save the people in the West. But of course, Marquis Benedict would not just leave it there.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t like before, he would still surely sell the kingdom. However, from the time he rejected Benedict’s offer, Daniel Cairo didn’t consider holding the power of the royal family important.</p>
<p>For the future of the kingdom, he couldn’t abandon Dmitry, but among the options between Dmitry and the people, he sided with the people. That is who Daniel Cairo was. Even if he was a puppet, he wanted to choose a path for the kingdom to have a chance.</p>
<p>[I know what you mean.]</p>
<p>Roman reacted calmly. He understood him. Roman Dmitry was a man who had to see the end of something if he pulled out his sword.</p>
<p>[Your Highness. From the moment we decided to purge, we knew that the Kronos Empire would cross our border. Whether it’s because of Count Gregory or Marquis Benedict, it doesn’t matter why. Kronos is making fun of us. They have the audacity to attack the Western Front without calling for more troops. What would happen if we left the enemies who had communicated with them safe in the nation? You might think that this is a step back to take one forward later on, but this will only cause twice as many deaths.]</p>
<p>If he had been born in a great time of peace, then Daniel Cairo might have been a good King. But these were turbulent times, and the cruelty of this world was something he had to face.</p>
<p>[The third line of defense on the Western Front is different from the two previous defense lines. And it’s clear that Kronos didn’t use their full force to attack. Trust the captains and commanders of Cairo. If we buy them enough time…]</p>
<p>A King who was emotional—Roman Dmitry didn’t think of it as bad. Because he was so tired of reality, he hoped the King would be someone who thought about the people.</p>
<p>[Within three days, I will clean up the nobles’ faction here and head to the Western Front to stop the Kronos Empire.]</p>
<p>Roman’s words made him go speechless. Even though he thought he couldn’t handle both, Roman Dmitry seemed determined.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. Roman Dmitry…..</p>
<p>“… Fine. Before the third day, make sure to punish those traitors.”</p>
<p>……was the best choice for the Cairo royal family.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The nobles’ final outburst in order to survive was expected. If pushed to the edge of a cliff, Marquis Benedict’s next best option was to attract the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>‘Last week, we slowly drove the nobles into a corner. And if we had stopped there, the civil war would have extended, but now that we made sure to cut off one of their attempts, they are trying to create a way for the fight to end to their advantage.’</p>
<p>On the first day of the siege, Roman Dmitry immediately attacked. Contrary to the force that seemed to indicate that the troops would advance right away, he chose a long-distance attack while taking enough rest.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Was it to minimize the damage?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry moved the troops at night. He had blocked the escape routes from the castle as much as possible and waited until the Magic Defense in the wall reached its limit. For a definite conclusion, he took the necessary steps.</p>
<p>The moment the enemy’s castle loses its defense on their walls, the perfect environment would form and prevent any of them from escaping.</p>
<p>One week was the perfect amount of time for the perfect purge. The enemies were currently thinking that the castle was worth staying in, but Roman Dmitry was already thinking about D-Day.</p>
<p>And tomorrow, as planned, a massive attack on Benedict Castle would begin. But on that evening, Roman Dmitry found an unexpected person.</p>
<p>“Commander. Please put me in as vanguard.”</p>
<p>It was a loud voice.</p>
<p>He was none other than Count Fabius.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Betraying the nobles, Count Fabius joined the King’s side. However, the fact that he wasn’t called for an important meeting at the time didn’t sit right.</p>
<p>‘From what I know, Roman Dmitry is a man who rewards and punishes equally. It means that if I do a good job like his men, then he will not turn a blind eye to my presence.’</p>
<p>After one week, Roman Dmitry finally spoke of a major attack. Once he heard about it, Count Fabius saw it as an opportunity and went to visit Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And then, he said in a loud voice,</p>
<p>“Commander. Please put me in as vanguard.”</p>
<p>The vanguard played a dangerous role. Knowing that his life would be in danger, Count Fabius looked right into Dmitry’s eyes.</p>
<p>Their relationship began as a traitorous one. And in order to immediately make progress in his relationship with him and not lag behind others, he needed to show his blind loyalty and stand in danger.</p>
<p>“I was a member of the nobles. However, I thought that their words were unreasonable, so I refused their summons and chose to follow Roman Dmitry. Give me a chance to prove my loyalty. By serving as the vanguard, I will bring your name to light.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a desperate voice. And at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Smile.</em></p>
<p>Roman smiled. He was an interesting man. He clung here and there like a bat, but he didn’t seem like a bad person to Roman.</p>
<p>‘Strange Demon held a position among the Four Heavenly Kings, and he had this kind of personality too.’</p>
<p>Strange Demon was a peculiar old man. If Crazy Demon represented excessive loyalty to Baek Joong-hyuk and Blood Demon showed the desire to be strong, Strange Demon had changed his Lord three times until he stuck with Baek Joong-hyuk.</p>
<p>If he were an ordinary person, he would have been killed, but he survived until the end and stayed with Baek Joong-hyuk. Baek Joong-hyuk hoped for a mutually beneficial relationship. When Strange Demon abandoned his third master and came to visit him, he gladly accepted the man’s oath of allegiance.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to put a fake face in front of me. Prove your worth with your skills. As long as you prove your use to me, I will not care about what you think.”</p>
<p>Betrayal was an option anyone had, and Baek Joong-hyuk chose to believe in their abilities. He didn’t want blind loyalty from those who followed him, but with his overwhelming skills, he controlled them in a way they wouldn’t betray him.</p>
<p>Strange Demon was the same. If he had betrayed him despite seeing his skills or shown him lesser skills, then he would have had to pay a price, but he didn’t do that. As a result, the monster held a position among the Four Heavenly Kings.</p>
<p>He led the battlefield without Baek Joong-hyuk and brought numerous victories, and his name made everyone tremble. And until the day Baek Joong-hyuk died, the man didn’t betray him.</p>
<p>They had a conversation once, and he said that his mind couldn’t think of betraying the Heavenly Demon at all.</p>
<p>‘Count Fabius.’</p>
<p>He was a traitor to the nobles. In a situation where others would choose to save themselves, he came to the other side and bowed his head.</p>
<p>And he was right. Just as he accepted Viscount Conrad, he didn’t judge him.</p>
<p>“It is dangerous. Can you do it?”</p>
<p>“I can do it! I will devote my life to you!”</p>
<p>His expression brightened, and Count Fabius touched his head.</p>
<p>The heirs of the noble families and the high-ranking nobles. There was a difference in their status too, and yet, despite betraying all of them, there was no shame on his face.</p>
<p>“Sure. Fabius, you will be standing at the forefront of this war.”</p>
<p>Fabius grabbed onto the string of opportunity.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day was bright. The nobles were no different from before. The fact that Kronos had their back made them happy. And it was then…</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>A figure walked towards the wall. A man in a robe.</p>
<p>It was a different development than before. The soldiers on the wall looked doubtful.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>And the man stopped walking as he looked up at the castle’s wall.</p>
<p>‘It’s my turn to repay the Lord’s trust.’</p>
<p>It was Felix. For the entire week, he hadn’t used magic at all. He only led the magicians, who gave power to the Flares with their own little magic, and saved his own power. In the first place, the time he would manifest his power was fixed. When the magicians had sufficiently reduced the durability of the wall’s Magic Defense in front of them, all the preparations were complete, and Felix stepped forward to take his role.</p>
<p><em>Swoosh.</em></p>
<p>The wind blew. As Felix ignited mana, sparks rose around him.</p>
<p>“Summoning Salamander.”</p>
<p><em>Crackle. Crackle.</em></p>
<p>Flames broke out. They wrapped themselves around each other and turned into a monster in the form of fire. It was the elemental magic of the Phoenix Magic Tower. And…</p>
<p>“Burning.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeeik!</em></p>
<p>The magic circle opened, and Felix swallowed Salamander. His entire body was blazing in flames, from his hair down to his legs.</p>
<p>Felix’s teacher always valued the ability to absorb fire. If someone else used Burning, they couldn’t survive Salamander.</p>
<p>“That.”</p>
<p>“Look there!”</p>
<p>There was an uproar on the wall. They couldn’t comprehend the scene in front of them. It wasn’t self-immolation, but they were fascinated by the sight of a man on fire.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Fire Rain.”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He broke through the boundary of his magic circle. Felix, who was just a 5-circle magician, borrowed Salamander’s power and entered the 6-circle level.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>Roaring!</em></p>
<p>Flames rose everywhere. There were just small sparks at first, but then a dark cloud rose, and the sparks turned into fist-sized balls as they all poured down.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>“Raise your shields!”</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a massacre. The soldiers, who were looking dumbfoundedly at the flames raining down, burned right then, and in an instant, screams spread everywhere.</p>
<p>The soldiers hurriedly tried to hide, but the torrential rain of flames kept them from getting too far away. The walls’ Magic Defense couldn’t block any of the flames, and because the Flares were being used at the same time, the Magic Defense couldn’t save everyone.</p>
<p><em>Pupung!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The Flares and the 6-circle magic—it was a real disaster. People called the Phoenix Magic Tower the best in terms of firepower. However, because the skill to accept fire was quite limited, they couldn’t produce more than two magicians who could use Burning. So Phoenix was rated to be the lowest of the 13 Magic Towers.</p>
<p>And Felix, the new Magic Tower master, succeeded in manifesting Burning.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!!</em></p>
<p>It was like hell. Just one magician and the Flares of five launchers. The walls, which were thought to be indestructible, started to burn, and the soldiers were burned black by the flames.</p>
<p>One week—Roman waited for the right time to fully demonstrate Felix’s power. After mobilizing the Flares to reduce the durability of the Magic Defense, he put an end to the delay.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“The wall has collapsed!”</p>
<p>The Magic Defense on the wall lost its power. They poured more mana stones, but the magic of the 6-circle magician made it reach its limit.</p>
<p>A hole was drilled, and at this point, the walls weren’t so tough anymore. As if welcoming the enemies, it opened wide.</p>
<p>“Soldiers, follow me!”</p>
<p>The Raccoon of Cairo, Count Fabius. He didn’t just give an order; he rode a horse himself.</p>
<p>“Put your lives on the line to punish the traitors!”</p>
<p>“Woahhhhh!”</p>
<p>His cry was the catalyst, and the battlefield was on fire. It was a scene that happened only on the first day of the three days that Roman had promised.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 180 - For A Certain End (6)</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>Arrows flew high in the sky. At the shower of the arrows raining down all at once, Count Fabius tightened the reins of his horse and raised his shield.</p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>The soldiers who were hit by the arrows collapsed. Although they protected themselves with their shields and armor, they weren’t completely safe when hundreds of arrows were raining down at the same time. The arrows pierced their flesh accurately. The soldiers who fell to the ground screamed, but the others didn’t care as they rushed to the wall.</p>
<p>And at the forefront was Fabius. He ran ahead on a war horse, and his heart continued to beat hard when he approached the wall.</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>He was no longer young. Like the other nobles, no one would criticize the man for turning back, but he risked his life here. The people of Cairo called Fabius a Raccoon for his ever-changing attitude, but it was his way of life.</p>
<p>Now that he had betrayed Marquis Benedict and followed Dmitry, he would devote himself to Dmitry as if today were his last. It was the same on the Southern Front. He took the risk to prove his worth to everyone.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Flames were continuously falling from the sky, yet he ran through them. He kept moving toward the wall despite the fact that arrows were hitting the knights all around him and screams were echoing.</p>
<p>All his life, he faced many obstacles on the battlefield. And once he made a decision, he followed through with it.</p>
<p>And so…</p>
<p><em>Jump.</em></p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>He jumped right into the hole in the wall. As soon as the hooves of his horse crushed the enemy, he jumped off his horse and swung his sword like lightning.</p>
<p>Blood splattered. Even though he didn’t possess the strength of an aura swordsman, he still had the power to defeat a single soldier.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other troops arrived. Count Fabius and the knights arrived a little earlier, but in an instant, the walls inside the castle turned into hell.</p>
<p>“Kill those traitors!”</p>
<p>It was the start of a full-blown battle. Count Fabius madly cut down the enemies. The number of enemies didn’t show any signs of decreasing no matter how many times he cut, and he started to run out of breath even though he had only swung the sword a couple of times. And because he had lived in the peaceful capital and since he was no longer young, he wasn’t able to maintain his momentum as fast as when he first entered the battlefield, but….</p>
<p>‘Haste.’</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>He used a relic, and soon a blue light spread over his body as he passed through the battle with agile movements that didn’t match his age.</p>
<p>Fabius wasn’t some stupid man to put his life in danger. If he had been hit by an arrow, the shield spell engraved on his armor would have activated, and in order to survive on the chaotic battlefield, he purchased buff-type relics in large numbers.</p>
<p>It was true that he risked his life as a vanguard, but that was only after he increased the chances of survival as much as possible.</p>
<p>Performance was a necessary element. Count Fabius was the type of person who wanted to be recognized for his accomplishments.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>He cut the throats of his enemies. He had already killed ten people. He had a hard time because he couldn’t cut their necks open quickly, probably because he was weak.</p>
<p><em>“Huak, huak.”</em></p>
<p>He gasped for air. His role was over. He couldn’t get himself to run any further. In this land that had turned into hell with people dying here and there, Count Fabius didn’t rush any further.</p>
<p>Anyway, from now on, he could no longer do much for the battle. Since he had properly fulfilled his role as the vanguard, he focused on calming his rapidly rising breath while paying attention to his surroundings. And…</p>
<p>‘From now, it is Roman Dmitry’s time.’</p>
<p>Fabius witnessed it.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—he was slaughtering the enemies who were behind him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The role of a vanguard. It wasn’t a matter that he could fully entrust to Fabius. Roman Dmitry had always been the vanguard on the battlefield, and that wouldn’t change now.</p>
<p>And so Roman Dmitry appeared right behind Fabius. Seeing the massacre begin as soon as he entered the battlefield, the soldiers of the nobles’ faction screamed at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>“Stop him!”</p>
<p>“It is Roman Dmitry!”</p>
<p>“Cairo’s Devil has appeared! Kill him by any means!”</p>
<p>In this hell, the demons revealed their murderous intent to Roman Dmitry. All the nearby soldiers rushed for Roman Dmitry, hoping to take him down with the numerical advantage they had.</p>
<p>But the results were different. In the blink of an eye, the bodies of those who Roman Dmitry came across were torn to pieces, and blood and death followed.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuaaak!”</em></p>
<p>The battlefield was mixed up with different people. It was impossible to properly grasp the situation from a distance, but blood was surely splattered everywhere, and the soldiers on the nobles’ side screamed.</p>
<p>In an instant, Roman Dmitry bathed in blood.</p>
<p>Even though he was covered in bright red blood, he didn’t slow down and continued moving forward without any care. Hostility was present everywhere. If he cut down the enemy in front of him, other enemies would come from both sides.</p>
<p>Before being killed by the devil, they wanted to somehow hurt him, but they only suffered in pain. Their bodies heated up, and when they came to their senses, they all had missing body parts.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming kill; it was one-sided. The enemies surrounded Roman Dmitry just like a pack of wolves unleashed on a sheep, but they all died in agony.</p>
<p>And the path was now open. They had no choice but to give way. The people who stood in his way all died, and their bodies paved a path.</p>
<p>How far did he go? Only Roman Dmitry could be seen in the enemy’s camp. There were others following him, but they were not able to break through the enemy lines as quickly as Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p>“Now! Everyone attack!”</p>
<p>The captain of the guards of Benedict Castle shouted.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>During the series of events, Cameron witnessed Roman Dmitry’s overwhelming power. As if a natural disaster suddenly unfolded, they couldn’t dare fight against this monstrous being as humans.</p>
<p>‘This is Cairo’s Devil.’</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose. Even after the Hector Kingdom captured the Southern Front, they seemed to understand why they were defeated just because of Roman Dmitry. With a monster like him shaking everything inside of them, how could they withstand it?</p>
<p>Cameron did not dare deal with Roman, but he had no intention of stepping down.</p>
<p>‘We even took into account the possibility of Roman Dmitry crossing the wall. Cairo’s best sword, Roman Dmitry, with his belligerent tendencies, will surely overdo it, and that is our chance to deal with him.’</p>
<p>So he waited for the right time and the perfect chance.</p>
<p>As Roman Dmitry pulled away from his allies, Cameron appeared.</p>
<p>“Now! Everyone attack!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura rose from all sides, and it was only because of a single enemy. The nobles recruited all of the remaining aura swordsmen from their families.</p>
<p>Their only goal was Roman Dmitry. They, who held their positions even when Count Fabius climbed over the wall and devastated the castle, rushed at Cameron’s command.</p>
<p>One hundred swordsmen—it was an overwhelming sight. And they simultaneously began to use their auras to attack Roman Dmitry. But….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The first one. The swordsman who rushed forward was split into two. His sword, which shone lightly with aura, slowly lost its light, and the man’s eyes went wide, unable to accept that he was cut down without even swinging his sword.</p>
<p>And it was just the beginning. Various forms of aura exploded and attacked Roman Dmitry, but they all coughed up blood and flew back.</p>
<p>With just one attack, the aura swordsmen had been swept away. It was the same with the 1-star aura swordsmen and the 3-star ones. Everyone was now scared, and they all lost their confidence to win.</p>
<p>There was something strange about it. Obviously, the number of people reaching one hundred should guarantee an overwhelming victory, but as time went on, the existence of aura didn’t seem to have such a meaning.</p>
<p>Both for the normal soldiers and the aura swordsmen, the results were not different. Before anyone could do anything, their necks were slashed with a sword clad in aura.</p>
<p><em>Crush.</em></p>
<p>A fist slammed into a man’s face, and he collapsed.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t seem like he would stop anytime soon. He didn’t just want to win this war. In the process of punishing the traitors, he wanted to showcase how Dmitry chooses to treat his enemies so that no one would do the same thing again. Roman Dmitry made his presence known. After taking down a hundred swordsmen, he slaughtered them as if they were normal soldiers.</p>
<p>“…N-No way.”</p>
<p>Cameron was shocked.</p>
<p>The one hundred swordsmen—the nobles’ faction were all smiles as they hired them. No matter how strong Roman Dmitry was, they were sure that so many people could handle him.</p>
<p>But what was this? It wasn’t human power. Roman Dmitry was a type of being that hadn’t been found in Cairo before.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Another life was lost.</p>
<p>They didn’t know anything about Cairo’s Devil. The swordsman, in his own way, was a person who was called the most powerful swordsman among a hundred. Looking at the corpses, his eyes were wide open, unable to accept the reality, and Cameron backed away.</p>
<p>It was over. The wall fell. And subduing Roman Dmitry in combat didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>‘I need to inform the commander.’</p>
<p>He turned around. There were many soldiers waiting on the battlefield for his orders, but Cameron just left them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The head of the nobles’ faction was in a safe place. While the nobles waited for the results with anxious faces, they finally received an audio communication from the castle’s walls.</p>
<p>[I-It is a huge deal!]</p>
<p>It was Cameron.</p>
<p>In a terrified voice, Cameron told him the grim reality.</p>
<p>[The wall has been completely breached. The Magic Defense has lost its function, and it is only a matter of time before the castle’s walls are taken over by them. In particular, there is no way to stop Roman Dmitry. All the aura swordsmen that the noble families sent suffered a one-sided annihilation.]</p>
<p>“… this.”</p>
<p>Beyond the device was Marquis Benedict, who looked so pale.</p>
<p>He felt dizzy.</p>
<p>Obviously, even the day before, they were hoping for a pink future with the support of the Kronos Empire, but now the Benedict Castle, which was called an iron castle, didn’t last even for a single day.</p>
<p>Fighting to the death here was madness. Knowing that, the leaders of the nobles faction did not even go near the castle walls in the first place.</p>
<p>[Hurry and run… <em>kuak!</em>]</p>
<p>A scream of death made Marquis Benedict hesitate. He felt goosebumps. The sound of a person’s life ending meant that someone killed Cameron.</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict.]</p>
<p>A familiar voice. Roman Dmitry followed through and grabbed the communication device with bloodstained hands.</p>
<p>[In the past week, you have committed an atrocity that threatens the safety of the nation. You tried to mobilize the nobles to attack Dmitry and then draw them in for rebellion, which eventually forced the Kronos Empire to intervene in the civil war. I think there are degrees of mistakes you did, and what you have done cannot be put aside anymore.]</p>
<p>It was cold. Even when no one responded, Roman didn’t stop talking.</p>
<p>[It is obvious to me. You will not be allowed to keep your life. So keep fighting until the end. On your knees, bowing your head, crying out the sins you committed from your mouth, and bursting into tears. I will punish all of you and your family members for treason.]</p>
<p>Between his words, the time to breathe felt like an eternity. They all held their breaths. They didn’t want Roman Dmitry to know that they were on the other side.</p>
<p>[We will meet soon.]</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off, and their hearts sank. A message was left by a one-sided call. The nobles, including Benedict, couldn’t take their eyes off the device with frightened expressions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 181 - For A Certain End (7)</p>
<p>His hands felt weak. Watching the device fall to the ground and break, Marquis Benedict’s mind sank into the abyss.</p>
<p>‘… just where did we go wrong?’</p>
<p>He began to look back. Right after the Ranking Matches, Marquis Benedict led a group of nobles to visit Roman Dmitry and forced him to make a choice. As a result, a full-fledged fight began, but he didn’t think it was the wrong choice. It was something he had been working on for over a year.</p>
<p>But the man said he would take an independent route and be alone, and they knew that leaving him alone to grow would weaken the power they held. He wanted to cut Roman down before he grew stronger. It was obviously the right decision, and Roman Dmitry drew his sword too.</p>
<p>Could it be that attacking the man was a mistake? If he held the troops in Benedict and didn’t send them to the Dmitry estate, then maybe the castle wouldn’t have collapsed.</p>
<p>No, on second thought, that didn’t seem like the case. Even with so many troops, Baron Winston wasn’t able to defeat the Dmitry estate. The difference in their power was too great in the first place.</p>
<p>Looking back at his choices, Marquis Benedict could come to one conclusion.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry made all my plans meaningless.’</p>
<p>Think about it. Whether it was his plan in Cairo or the Benedict Castle’s divide and conquer, these operations should not have failed. That was the power of being objective. It was the natural result when he brought in the best swordsmen to fight. But they couldn’t even get the job done. When Roman Dmitry was slaughtering all of them alone, it made his head spin.</p>
<p>The power the man held was the reason for the failure. Just as the Cairo Kingdom did not dare look at the empires, the nobles chose the wrong opponent in the first place. It was the end.</p>
<p>Looking at the broken communication device, Marquis Benedict was frightened.</p>
<p>‘If we stay like this, death cannot be avoided.’</p>
<p>Cairo’s Devil was chasing him. Marquis Benedict came to his senses and spoke in an urgent voice.</p>
<p>“The siege warfare at the castle is a failure. We have to avoid this place for now and borrow the power of the Kronos Empire to reverse the situation. Move fast. If we are captured like this, the future of the nobles is over.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The nobles nodded with pale expressions.</p>
<p>There were still soldiers left at Benedict Castle. They risked their lives here for the nobles, yet the leaders didn’t even care about them. After all, they were just collateral. As long as they could save their own lives and use Kronos to get power, they could secure more people. So they moved quickly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a secret passage was created for such situations. Since they had a way to escape unnoticed, they still had a spark of hope in this situation.</p>
<p>How long did they run? They were out of breath.</p>
<p>Their bodies were weighed down by the armor they wore for no reason, and their foreheads were drenched in sweat. Normally, such things would have annoyed the nobles.</p>
<p>Thinking that just one second of delay would give the devil a chance to kill them, they continued to rush forward.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached the end. They saw a bright light for the first time after passing through the dark passage, but Marquis Benedict, who was in the lead, had a pale expression.</p>
<p><em>Drop. Drop.</em></p>
<p>The sound of blood dripping from a sword.</p>
<p>A man was using a corpse as a chair. And confirming it was Marquis Benedict, he stood up with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>“You are too late, Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>He was Kevin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Benedict’s choice was so obvious. If he failed in the war, everyone knew he wouldn’t take the risk to stay and die.</p>
<p>Last week, they had perfectly grasped the secret passages. Kevin and the other soldiers were guarding one of them. And the Marquis appeared right where Kevin was.</p>
<p>It felt like his last hope had been crushed. His face still had a youthful look, but Benedict knew how terrifying Kevin was.</p>
<p>‘Dmitry’s demon…!’</p>
<p>At Roman’s command, two swordsmen rushed forward. Kevin was one of them, and he still couldn’t forget the sight of him rushing at hundreds of troops. He gulped and hurriedly hid behind the escorts who followed him and shouted in a terrified voice,</p>
<p>“Attack now! I want you to kill them!”</p>
<p>The escort knights were also clearly frightened. They exchanged hesitant glances for a moment, but they couldn’t refuse Marquis Benedict’s order.</p>
<p>Kevin didn’t move an inch when he saw them. And seeing him just staring at them made the knights grit their teeth.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“Kill him!”</p>
<p>Dozens of knights risked their lives. With faces that suppressed their fear, they swung their swords at Kevin, looking like they would burst into tears at any moment. And…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>A throat was cut open. Blood splashed with every move of his sword. And Kevin avoided the attacks that came in from all directions through the narrow gaps.</p>
<p>One sword cut his fluttering hair, but Kevin, without even blinking an eye, used his short stature to shove his sword into the opponent’s chin.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“Uhhh.”</p>
<p>The knight choked on his own blood. The opponent’s eyes were white, and he collapsed, scattering dust on the ground.</p>
<p>Just one swordsman. Only Kevin moved. There were other soldiers behind him, but they all just watched Kevin fight.</p>
<p>It was a scene that made them go stiff. The escort knights desperately attacked Kevin, but they were helpless as their body parts were cut off one by one. And when he swung his sword with his right hand, the arms of the opponent blocking him were cut off. And when the knight turned to run away with a scared face, Kevin jumped to cut his throat.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s demon. He was exactly as the rumors claimed. As the blood flowed in streams, the nobles, including Marquis Benedict, fled without looking back. After all, the escort knights were just collateral.</p>
<p>He looked at the nobles with anger in his eyes, but the nobles only grew farther away from him. However, Kevin didn’t go after the nobles. He only stopped the breath of the knights who were left behind. Because Marquis Benedict was nothing more than a cornered rat.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>“Huak, huak.”</em></p>
<p>Marquis Benedict gasped. The soldiers and the knights were abandoned. He didn’t think he was a coward. Since they existed for their well-being, he didn’t feel the slightest sense of guilt while running away.</p>
<p>The problem was…</p>
<p>“This fucking…!”</p>
<p>As they retreated, another being held them back. It was Chris. Roman Dmitry’s men didn’t participate in the siege.</p>
<p>Knowing that the moment the castle would collapse, the opponent would collapse as well. Hence, they were given a special order, and they completely blocked the way for Marquis Benedict to escape.</p>
<p>In this war, not a single person involved in the rebellion would be spared. And he knew that the way he would deal with them would remain a mark for the future.</p>
<p>“Where are you going so quickly?”</p>
<p>Chris stepped forward, and Marquis Benedict hurriedly turned around. Seeing them flee in the other direction, Chris captured the other nobles, leaving Marquis Benedict alone.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuaaak!”</em></p>
<p>There was a scream. Chris killed a noble on the spot. He stabbed his sword slowly to make him scream more, and Marquis Benedict covered his ears as he ran away.</p>
<p>It felt like he was losing his sanity. It was hard for him to accept that he, who once had great power, was now afraid.</p>
<p>Wherever he went, there was a subordinate of Roman. At first, many nobles followed him, but then one by one, they continued to die.</p>
<p>And now his face was covered with tears and snot. But he continued to run by thinking,</p>
<p>‘Right, play with me how much you want. If I manage to get out of here alive, I will definitely avenge what happened here, regardless of whether I side with Kronos or not. And at that time, even if you beg to be spared, I will rip out your limbs and kill all those who followed you.’</p>
<p>The desire to survive fueled his thoughts of revenge. His feet were swollen, and his toenails were broken. He got scars on his body while running through all sorts of things, but he didn’t care. And after running for a long time, there was hope in his eyes.</p>
<p>‘Here.’</p>
<p>There was a small gap under a rock. The animal feces around it gave off a terrible smell, but saving his life was more important now, so he didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He hid under the rock and dragged himself, with animal feces smearing all over his body. He held his breath, unable to breathe in the air. He would do anything just to live. And Marquis Benedict’s desire to live burned stronger than ever.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sun had gone down. The night had never been so long. Even though he was trembling from hunger and cold, he shut his mouth when he heard some people nearby.</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Roman’s men were roaming everywhere. It seemed like they were checking the surroundings to find him, but they didn’t seem to think of checking the place where there were animal feces.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict was the symbol of power. Even if his life was at stake, he never thought he would do such a thing.</p>
<p>Tears trickled down. He was used to this smell, but the situation he was in felt miserable.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry—it is all because of him. Cairo’s throne was right in front of me, but then he ruined everything. I will not fall, I will survive and claim the throne.’</p>
<p>He shuddered. His consciousness was starting to fade, but he forcibly endured all of this.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“… Marquis Benedict. It is all over. Come out now.”</p>
<p>It was a familiar voice. It was Viscount Owen’s. And hearing his voice, Marquis Benedict almost screamed out, but then he covered his mouth.</p>
<p>It was a clear attempt to use the prisoners to locate him. If that wasn’t the reason, wasn’t it enough to just pull him out?</p>
<p>“The Benedict Castle has been captured, all the nobles’ troops have been captured, and not a single one of the leaders managed to escape. We are done, Marquis. Your family was also dragged out and is now pleading for their lives. So please convince Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>His voice was desperate. At first, his voice was far away, but now it is closer.</p>
<p>“You don’t even know, Marquis. There is no way to escape from here. Roman blocked all the routes, expecting us to flee from the start. Didn’t you feel that when running away? We are being played with. That means there was no way to escape in the first place.”</p>
<p>His blood went cold. Those words seemed to indicate that he knew where he was.</p>
<p>At that moment, along with the movement of a human being, a new voice filled his ears,</p>
<p>“Hey! You bastard! Do you think people don’t know you are hiding there? You said you would spare my life if I showed the way, but now you are acting selfishly until the very end. Please just go to hell… <em>kuak</em>!”</p>
<p>The sound of death made him go pale. And then he knew—his position was discovered right from the start, but Roman Dmitry just let him stay there.</p>
<p>Blood spilled on the floor. The blood that flowed from Viscount Owen soaked Marquis Benedict’s clothes.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p>“Come out.”</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry’s voice.</p>
<p>As his heart sank, Marquis Benedict tightly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 182 - For A Certain End (8)</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>“Walk quickly.”</p>
<p>A hard object was pushed onto Marquis Benedict’s back. He walked along the path missing one of his shoes, with his hair all messed up and with a miserable appearance.</p>
<p>Running through the bushes, the soles of his feet were torn. His feet were in pain, but as soon as he arrived at Benedict Castle, he couldn’t help but raise his head as all eyes focused on him from all directions.</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict!”</p>
<p>“Fucking trash!”</p>
<p>“Look at who ran away alone!”</p>
<p>They were the soldiers of the nobles’ faction. Those who tried to defend Benedict Castle until the end were captured. Actually, the war shouldn’t have ended like this.</p>
<p>They fought until the end, even after Roman Dmitry appeared, but at some point, they realized that something was strange—no one was giving orders.</p>
<p>Obviously, Cameron was shouting from the walls, but soon he disappeared, and the nobles’ faction, including Marquis Benedict, never showed themselves the entire time. The moment their trust collapsed, the war ended. One by one, they threw away their weapons and expressed their intentions to surrender, and such feelings quickly spread everywhere.</p>
<p>This war was a civil war that was happening in their kingdom. It was a war that happened according to the cause of the leaders who led the soldiers, but since their leaders had fled, they no longer had any reason to fight.</p>
<p>The balance had collapsed. The kingdom’s troops arrested all the soldiers who had lost their hostility and looked inside the castle until the day was over, blocking any unknown variables.</p>
<p>It was all over, and the victors were the troops of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And at the sight of Marquis Benedict being dragged out, the prisoners spat curses at him.</p>
<p><em>“Ptooey!”</em></p>
<p>“Go to hell!”</p>
<p>The saliva hit his face and dripped to the floor, and this made Marquis Benedict’s stomach boil. His body was already smeared with animal feces. In addition, he couldn’t accept this situation where the nobles were being punished by mere soldiers, and the most powerful person in Cairo was being manhandled.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>He got down on his knees right in the center of the square. All eyes focused on him, and he raised his head, watching Roman Dmitry approach him.</p>
<p>‘… This is how I will die.’</p>
<p>At that moment, Marquis Benedict’s mind drifted into his past memories, which he had forgotten.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Decades ago, a grand banquet was held in Cairo. At the marriage between the Cairo royal family and the most prestigious Benedict family, envoys from many nations sent their best wishes and blessings.</p>
<p>And Marquis Benedict was also there. Having inherited the estate from his father at such a young age, he couldn’t hide his delight at the marriage of his younger sister, whom he looked after like a father. From that day on, he was really happy.</p>
<p>It was Daniel Cairo’s father. Even at that time, the former King was known to be incompetent.</p>
<p>“The actions of the Kronos Empire are becoming worse with each passing day. They invade our borders at any opportunity they get, and even within the kingdom, they interfere with our state affairs! Your Majesty. Cairo is powerless now. I know very well that we have no other choice but to watch them do this, but that doesn’t mean we should just suffer like this. We need to set an example of our power. We need to prove Cairo’s will by cutting down the heads of the spies.”</p>
<p>Many people were dying at the Western Front, and Marquis Benedict visited the royal palace with rage and spoke loudly, wanting some results. And at that time, Benedict was a patriot.</p>
<p>Thinking that the Benedict family and the Cairo royal family were one and the same, he couldn’t bear to watch the Kronos Empire looking down on the kingdom.</p>
<p>But the King didn’t do anything. The reason was simple. He couldn’t put more people in danger. The King decided that he couldn’t handle the loss of life from a retaliation that wouldn’t bear any results.</p>
<p>It was said that loving the people was a virtue of the King, but it didn’t seem like that to Marquis Benedict. He was just standing aside when such things were happening. Looking far into the future, it was clear that many people’s lives would be lost.</p>
<p>However, the King pushed for peace more than power, and for him, it was ideal not to fight back. And from then on, Cairo’s power began to collapse.</p>
<p>As the King remained indecisive and delayed his judgments, the Kronos Empire and the Valhalla Empire managed to increase their powers. And to oppose them, Marquis Benedict gathered forces. Even if the Cairo royal family was being foolish, he wasn’t going to give up.</p>
<p>And around that time, something happened. The Queen, who was weak, fell ill and died. It was the same disease as Marquis Benedict’s father. At that moment, all the ties he had with the royal family collapsed, and he watched his sister’s funeral with a cold expression and questioned if the King was right.</p>
<p>The queen’s position was one of honor, yet the empires laughed at them. Their expressions were devoid of sadness, which fueled Marquis Benedict’s rage.</p>
<p>“I can no longer trust the Cairo royal family. I will set up an independent force that represents Cairo and lead it down the right path. Tell this to the nobles who wish to follow me. ‘If you intend to follow me, ‘Benedict,’ rather than the Cairo royal family, come and pledge allegiance to me on the appointed date.’”</p>
<p>And that was how the nobles’ faction was formed. He couldn’t trust the King who only spoke ideal words, and Daniel Cairo, their only heir, was too young. The kingdom held no future.</p>
<p>Later on in the history of Cairo, even if he would be labeled insane for power, he believed that his decision was correct.</p>
<p>And then the previous King died.</p>
<p>With the result that everyone hoped for, Marquis Benedict took the throne.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The execution of his death. He wanted to face his end as calmly as possible, but the memories of that time made him cry.</p>
<p>It was unfair. What did he do wrong? Even though he could have given up the kingdom at any time, he did his best to maintain the Cairo Kingdom. And although he didn’t follow the royal family, he also did things for the sake of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Right in front of him, Roman stopped walking. Seeing his gaze coldly looking down with his sword, Marquis Benedict raised his face and shouted,</p>
<p>“I-I am not wrong. I have been devoted to the nation, and here you are, trying to kill me! Cairo’s former King clearly had the chance to deal with the forces of the empires, but he didn’t, and that caused the deaths of the people. If this world were heaven, where blood and death aren’t allowed, he would have been a King that the people would admire, but that is not the reality. While the weak King ruined the nation, I held the balance so Cairo wouldn’t collapse!”</p>
<p>He yelled out loud. He was desperate. He wanted to release his accumulated emotions, regardless of how others perceived him.</p>
<p>“The previous King died. Daniel Cairo ascended the throne, spouting absurd remarks about creating a nation where the people are happy. Roman Dmitry. Can you sincerely serve such a King? If you’re making cold judgments like you always do, you should understand how I feel. The Kronos Empire crossed the border too many times, and we are now infested with spies from other nations, and then the Hector Kingdom declared war on us. That is Cairo. Then, shouldn’t the person who takes the throne be strong enough to protect the kingdom from all of this chaos? Try answering me. Tell me I am wrong!”</p>
<p>He succumbed to evil. His eyes were red, and it felt like tears of blood were flowing down from them.</p>
<p>Roman looked calm. Looking at Marquis Benedict’s figure, who insisted that he was right, brought back their past interactions.</p>
<p>“I will not criticize the choice you made. As you said, Cairo had the chance to set things right.”</p>
<p>But….</p>
<p>“I will not say that the choice of the former King was wrong. If you had led the nobles’ faction and made Cairo stronger, you would have had the right to criticize him for not drawing his sword at a better time, but look at these results. What did you do? Despite forming a faction, the power system remained the same, and when Hector crossed the border you didn’t think about the safety of the nation. You only cared about your power, and the cause you speak of has lost its meaning. And when you were on the verge of being defeated, you joined hands with the Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>He pointed his sword, and Marquis Benedict didn’t avert his gaze. Even at the moment of his death, he spoke about how unfair things were.</p>
<p>“It is not shameful for the powerless to bow their heads. If the King had not taken responsibility for that decision, he would have had to bear the weight of countless lives. You cannot blame him. I can tell even looking at it now. When you put yourself in the position of a decision-maker, you will realize that you have become more of a scumbag than the person you are blaming. Even though the royal family is criticized for being incompetent and the royal family’s existence has been completely denied, they never made the choice to sell the nation.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Marquis Benedict’s eyes wavered. He felt he was wrong. He understood what Roman’s words meant. He crawled on his knees and grabbed onto Roman’s legs.</p>
<p>“… please, please let me live. I wanted people to realize my hard work. From now on, I will do my very best for the Cairo royal family—no, for Dmitry. So please spare me.”</p>
<p>In his miserable state, he pleaded. His face was determined not to die, and Roman said,</p>
<p>“No, from the moment you drew your sword against me in Cairos, I was prepared for what to do if I lost the war—after Dmitry was burned, my family would have been made fun of. You started this war. This is a fight that only ends when one side dies. It doesn’t matter whose side is right. The loser takes all the blame for the war. Benedict, I’ll show everyone that you were wrong.”</p>
<p>“Please, just this…”</p>
<p>“Cairo will remember this day.”</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>And his sword moved as everyone gasped. Some stared straight ahead with their eyes wide open, some averted their gaze, and some were shocked.</p>
<p>This was the price of rebellion. Roman’s sword cut off Marquis Benedict’s head.</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>His head rolled down on the ground, and his body thumped down.</p>
<p>The giant of Cairo—it was the end of Marquis Benedict, who was once called a living power.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time passed slowly for the Cairo royal family. Daniel Cairo couldn’t accept that the fate of the nation rested on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘The first day of the three days had passed. If we take a long time to subdue the nobles, the chances of Kronos invading us through the Western Front will increase. Did I make the right choice? If I had reached a compromise at the right time, the people of Cairo would not have had to face a war.’</p>
<p>He pondered over the same thing and began to envy people like Roman Dmitry. A man like him couldn’t shake off the thoughts of whether his decision was right or wrong.</p>
<p>And then he opened his eyes. He sat on his throne with a straight back, and he was determined not to doubt his choice as much as possible. His own father was a good person. But he didn’t want to be a good person like him. It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! We won! It is said that Roman Dmitry has captured the Benedict Castle!”</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>He jumped up and left his chair.</p>
<p>Just one day, one day to take down a castle. His entire body felt tremors of joy as Roman Dmitry turned his words into reality.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was surely a monster Cairo couldn’t handle, and in the future, in order to move with the monster, he would have to give up his meek actions.</p>
<p>But still, he felt good. He didn’t mind the life of a puppet as long as he could lead Cairo in the right direction. This feeling of happiness was good enough.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on the major achievement, and those who did this will be rewarded. Order them to move to the Western Front at once. The movement of the Kronos Empire is odd, and late reactions will bring horrible consequences.”</p>
<p>He suppressed his joy.</p>
<p>Although the civil war was settled, Cairo’s peace was not yet guaranteed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 183 - Current Life’s Relationship (1)</p>
<p>On the day before the fall of the Benedict Castle, Count Vandenberg, the commander of the Western Front, received a report that disrupted the peace in Cairo.</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire has crossed the borders! The first line of defense has been breached, and they are leading their troops to the second line of defense. Commander, please give us your order. It is only a matter of time before the second line of defense is broken!”</p>
<p>He received a report from his subordinate. There has been a civil war in Cairo for the last few days. Daniel Cairo raised his troops to suppress the rebellion, but none of the troops on the Western Front were summoned because there was an evil force that existed beyond the West.</p>
<p>And since no one knew when the Kronos Empire might invade the borders, they put up a minimum safety net. The first line of defense was nothing more than a temporary defensive position.</p>
<p>In fact, they had the role of a scout to report the invasion of their enemies, and from the second line of defense, supplies for a battle were prepared.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg said,</p>
<p>“Call the troops right now! Cairo is in chaos due to the civil war. Under the current situation, if the Kronos Empire steps into our land, the chaos will be out of control.”</p>
<p>It was the best decision that their enemies could make. The third line of defense was their last resort, so they needed to win at least one battle in the second line of defense.</p>
<p>And right then….</p>
<p>“No. We have to abandon the second line of defense and retreat with the troops.”</p>
<p>It was the end of the meeting. One of the staff on the Western Front spoke up, and Count Vandenberg asked,</p>
<p>“Flora, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>It was Flora Lawrence, and everyone turned to her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The odd one on the Western Front—Flora was a celebrity in the West. After she left her family, she entered the Royal Academy and studied tactics. Then she suddenly announced her intention to volunteer on the Western Front, and the capital was in uproar because of it.</p>
<p>It was an unusual request, and she was not just any ordinary woman but the daughter of a noble family, so the opinions were divided. In the end, they left the decision to Flora’s father.</p>
<p>Viscount Lawrence, who heard of his daughter’s decision, sent a message saying that he believed in her.</p>
<p>It was the first time it happened in Cairo. There had never been a case where a woman from a noble family with a great future wanted to head into war, and many didn’t like it. Sometimes, there were such people.</p>
<p>Because some people had the choice, they could head to the battlefield for the sake of experience and not risk their lives. So there was a lot of prejudice. The people in the West rejected Flora, but it only took less than a month for that perception to change.</p>
<p>And what she had shown thus far had made the Count willingly listen to her.</p>
<p>“Flora. What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire has periodically invaded Cairo’s borders. They were meant to be a warning, but they didn’t genuinely intend to capture Cairo. But it’s different this time. Civil war broke out inside Cairo, and Marquis Benedict was reportedly cornered. The situation is quite tricky, and I think the Kronos Empire’s attack has something to do with the civil war.”</p>
<p>“… you mean, the Kronos Empire has joined sides with Marquis Benedict?”</p>
<p>“I am not sure who it is, but it might be because of Count Gregory, who is imprisoned, or it might also be because of Marquis Benedict, who requested for help. What is certain is that the Kronos Empire invaded the borders despite the conflict within the kingdom. Therefore, we shouldn’t be overlooking this situation.”</p>
<p>The room was in chaos. Flora’s words meant that the Kronos Empire was involved in the civil war.</p>
<p>In this unusual situation, one person asked,</p>
<p>“Flora. If so, isn’t it more important to stop the Kronos Empire at the second line of defense? War is a crucial thing, and we need to hold the lead. If we withdraw right now, then we will have to give up a lot of war resources.”</p>
<p>“Yes, right. Under normal circumstances, it makes no sense to abandon the second line of defense. However, if Kronos has decided to use the civil war for their motives, then their goal is to pass through the third line of defense at all costs and invade Cairo. In addition, with the kingdom dealing with the rebellious forces, if they don’t have supporting troops to spare, then the worst situation awaits us since we have to deal with the Kronos Empire all on our own. We cannot always have the best option, and the fate of Cairo is at stake this time, so we must filter out the worst and best options.”</p>
<p>Flora added strength to her voice. Ever since she was assigned to the West, she had proven her merit on the battlefield. And the moment people fully embraced her, regardless of her gender or status, Flora Lawrence turned into a key member.</p>
<p>Therefore, Flora’s advice couldn’t be overlooked.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg was silent. After thinking for a long time, he made a decision.</p>
<p>“Flora is right. Order the troops in the second line to retreat. In case the worst happens, we will prepare for a war against Kronos in the third line of defense.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation was as they had expected. The Kronos Empire wasn’t satisfied with the second line of defense. They marched beyond that place, and soon after, the troops received a call from the Cairo royal family.</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict colluded with the Kronos Empire. They intend to break the third line of defense and directly attack Cairo, and the kingdom’s forces need time to sort out the rebellion that is happening. Hold on for three days. If you can endure that much, I will quickly organize the troops and send reinforcements to the Western Front.]</p>
<p>After receiving the message from the royal family, a meeting was called. As the heads of the Western Front gathered together, Baron Noel, the head of the staff, spoke.</p>
<p>“His Majesty promised us three days. But common sense tells us that it is impossible to quell a rebellion in three days. Marquis Benedict has been preparing for a rebellion for a long time, and from what we know, his castle has all the preparations needed for a war. Although the commander leading them is Roman Dmitry, who had defeated the Hector Kingdom, we need to prepare something.”</p>
<p>“Right. Besides, even if they manage to subdue the rebellion, it will take them some time to move. Even if they used the warp gate, it will take them a day to arrive, so does it make sense for them to clean up Benedict Castle in one day?”</p>
<p>Everyone felt negative about it. The West and Benedict—since they had warp gates, there was no need to travel long distances on foot. But even taking those advantages into account, it felt like three days were too short.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg said,</p>
<p>“You are right. If we really don’t want the Kronos Empire to invade us, then we need to secure war materials as fast as we can and prepare to defend. In the worst case, the army of the kingdom might be unable to clean up the rebellious forces, and in the end, it means we will have to overcome this crisis on our own.”</p>
<p>“I have different thoughts.”</p>
<p>A beautiful voice. It was Flora who spoke this time.</p>
<p>Baron Noel asked,</p>
<p>“You think differently? Do you think the troops of the kingdom will clean them up in three days?”</p>
<p>“I also think three days is tight, but His Majesty said that he gave a 3-day deadline to Roman Dmitry. Then, there is a good chance that it won’t last longer than five days at the most. They will likely capture the rebels in three days, and given their travel time, they will arrive in five days.”</p>
<p>“How can you be that sure?”</p>
<p>“I think everyone is familiar with the relationship between Dmitry and Lawrence. Roman Dmitry is a man who makes the best of the worst situations. From the moment he took down Barco with Lawrence, I knew that he wasn’t a person who could be judged according to common sense. And such a being said three days, so I trust him.”</p>
<p>The people on the Western Front weren’t incompetent. Each of them had their own strengths, and as long as they could protect this place, Flora thought they could change the situation.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. She experienced his power firsthand. Even with the absurd time they were given, she trusted Roman Dmitry, but Baron Noel was different.</p>
<p>“All baseless judgments. If we take a step back and your words turn into reality, what do you think is the right way to respond?”</p>
<p>“Time is running out for us and for Kronos. Marquis Benedict will try to encroach on Cairo’s territory before he falls, and if so, it is clear they will do their best from the start. Even if we move to the third line of defense, there is no guarantee we can stop their attack. In the end, there is just one way.”</p>
<p>Her gaze was focused. If she had noticed Kronos’s intentions and decided it was best for them to retreat, she also needed to pay attention to this choice.</p>
<p>“There is a saying that offense is the best defense. I think it is best if we run into them first and weaken them so they cannot knock us down in the coming five days.”</p>
<p>Attack—at Flora’s remarks, the faces of the leaders were flustered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a different and impossible idea. And because Flora knew why they were flustered, she presented what she had prepared in advance.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Rustle.</em></p>
<p>She unfolded the material. As the people’s eyes focused, she explained in a calm voice,</p>
<p>“We need to analyze Kronos’s attack pattern. When they invaded simply as a warning, they normally attempted hand-to-hand combat, but when they needed a certain victory like now, they liked to mobilize their war magicians. The data presented here proves it. It is Kronos’s general pattern to use magic to demolish the walls and invade the castle with their troops.”</p>
<p>“That is something we know. Isn’t it more important to secure the mana stones along with war supplies?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If we use Magic Defense, the fight will last for a long time. But it is an open fact on both sides that if the enemy uses their war magicians, we will use Magic Defense. And the war magicians will amplify their power. And if it is the Kronos Empire, which has seven Magic Towers, bringing in more magicians isn’t a difficult task to do.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The page was turned.</p>
<p>“Look at this. The enemy’s attacks have a certain pattern. Their magicians maximize their power while using magic from a safe distance from our arrows. This is because mages are vulnerable when casting magic, and the distance is usually around 1 km. Not only do the arrows not reach the distance, but even if we attempt a long-range attack, the accuracy is very low. And if they have more magicians, they will be ready with defensive spells.”</p>
<p>“It’s about 1 km. Does that mean there’s a way we can use that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If we can anticipate where the magicians will be and set a magic trap in that area.”</p>
<p>Baron Noel smiled as if he were exhausted. Flora’s words were nice to listen to, but they were also absurd.</p>
<p>“It is impossible. Although the 1 km distance can be specified, it only refers to the distance from the castle wall, and it isn’t possible to guarantee where they will cast their magic. We also can’t secure magic traps in huge quantities, and the magicians can detect the location of the traps with mana. If they feel anything strange, they will make the traps useless and use magic from a safe location.”</p>
<p>“Right.. so, from now on, we need to act strategically.”</p>
<p>Flora’s voice rose as she looked at everyone. Right after entering the academy, she learned about the bloody battlefields.</p>
<p>“We must offer them a Battle of Great Warriors.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In a war between nations, a Battle of Great Warriors is used to suppress the opponent’s initiative. Since the Kronos Empire is strong, they will not refuse it because they are sure that their men will win.”</p>
<p>“Even if they accept it…. No way?!”</p>
<p>Baron Noel was shocked at her strategy. He figured out what Flora said.</p>
<p>“If we set up in advance and offer them a Battle of Great Warriors, they will have no choice but to move their troops according to our position. Then, it is possible for the magicians to select a place from which they will cast their spells. They will leave the troops behind and move forward to cast their magic, which will greatly reduce the margin of error.”</p>
<p>“Then, how about them feeling the mana?”</p>
<p>“The swordsman who will participate in the Battle of Great Warriors plays a huge role. If the swordsman fights with his aura at its maximum, the mana concentration in the surroundings will increase. Even the most sensitive magician cannot get through such a raging aura and detect the magic traps. The moment they step on the magic traps with complacency because of the battle in front of them, we can destroy them slowly and surely.”</p>
<p>The plans she made surprised all of them.</p>
<p>Baron Noel, who had been looking at her negatively, was now nodding his head. This was the best outcome. He only raised his voice because it seemed impossible, but now he was willing to accept it. Her plan was charming. They could deal with the magicians and delay Kronos.</p>
<p>Flora added,</p>
<p>“The question is, who will be the Great Warrior willing to go? The allied warriors will have to risk their lives and prolong the match for our plan to work. No, to be honest, the one who is willing to go might not even survive. I am not sure what kind of swordsman the Kronos Empire will send out, but the opponent won’t be easy to defeat.”</p>
<p>It was a dilemma. In order to complete the operation, one had to die.</p>
<p>And right then, one of the people in the meeting said,</p>
<p>“I will do it.”</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone was surprised. The man was Rodwell Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 184 - Current Life’s Relationship (2)</p>
<p>All the people who were there looked at each other. Rodwell Dmitry was someone who fit Flora’s conditions perfectly. He had the skills and the courage, and he was confident enough to make the plan happen.</p>
<p>His time in the West had proven his worth. No one would deny that, but the problem was that Dmitry’s name was too valuable to be lost right now.</p>
<p>So Baron Noel said,</p>
<p>“No. Didn’t Flora say it? The one who will participate in the Battle of Great Warriors must be prepared for death. I understand Mr. Rodwell’s will, but we are not sacrificing someone like you here.”</p>
<p>Rodwell’s older brother, Roman Dmitry, had risen to power in Cairo. If the nobles’ rebellion is settled and Kronos gets defeated, then the era of Roman Dmitry would start.</p>
<p>Baron Noel wasn’t stupid. He was patriotic and experienced all sorts of hardships on the Western Front, but he also had the desire to return to the capital with great achievements, so he couldn’t send out Rodwell now. Roman Dmitry’s existence, the backbone of the Dmitry family, made the value of this man different.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“So is there another swordsman who can participate on my behalf then?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that something we have to look into? Rather than making a quick decision…”</p>
<p>“No. When a choice is made because of the decision of the leaders, we have no choice but to force the sacrifice on those who obviously do not want it. It’s for Cairo, so how can a knight refuse this act? And with this plan, there aren’t that many options. There are swordsmen stronger than me on the Western Front, but their lives cannot be sacrificed in such a place. You have to think about the situation after the Battle of Great Warriors is over. So it is only right to make the most meaningful choice now.”</p>
<p>He was not the best swordsman in the West. Currently, even Count Vandenberg was a 4-star swordsman, but he couldn’t let the commander die.</p>
<p>Rodwell looked at everyone. They were all shocked, but no one could say that he was wrong.</p>
<p>“Someone has to do this. But this doesn’t mean that I am going with the intention of putting my life on the line. I will do my best to defeat the warrior that the Kronos Empire sends, so allow me to go there.”</p>
<p>“….Rodwell.”</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg called out to him, looking sad. Rodwell Dmitry, who was assigned to the Western Front as his first assignment, was an immature kid like any other his age. He had seen so many deaths, and he finally grew up. He is now a full-fledged swordsman, and he has earned the respect of everyone.</p>
<p>The meeting room was silent. Even though he was his disciple, Count Vandenberg couldn’t be considerate of only one person. And so…</p>
<p>“I understand. Rodwell Dmitry, you will take on the role of participating in the Battle of Great Warriors.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The decision was made. The plan was in motion, and Rodwell Dmitry nodded with a calm expression.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the meeting, there was someone waiting for Rodwell Dmitry to come out.</p>
<p>“Why are you so eager to do something risky each time?”</p>
<p>The Western Front had two famous people. One was Flora Lawrence, and the other was Rodwell Dmitry. They both went to the Cairo Royal Academy.</p>
<p>Rodwell was granted one year of service for training, but he chose to stay on the Western Front to complete his full term. It was during the time when Dmitry was in the spotlight. And no one understood why he chose to abandon his wealth and honor only to stay back in this dangerous place.</p>
<p>In each battle he participated in, he always took the lead. He never backed down even a little against the Kronos Empire and led the Cairo army in front.</p>
<p>And now the people on the Western Front truly respected him. He was considered a strong warrior, but not by Flora.</p>
<p>“You are not a normal person. People say that it is an act of patriotism for Cairo, but the truth is that you are a madman who can’t die. There are a lot of people here who follow you. The leaders here have acknowledged the fact that you are the best, but if you really want to do something, then you shouldn’t die like this.”</p>
<p>“This is something I need to do.”</p>
<p>Rodwell looked at Flora. Flora Lawrence—he had heard of the rumors about her. She was the woman who promised to marry his older brother but broke off their engagement and gave up her noble life. Perhaps she was someone who could understand his feelings.</p>
<p>“Flora. You know what kind of person Roman Dmitry was. That was why a wise woman like you made the extreme decision of breaking off that marriage. How did you feel then? Were you willing to accept the fact that Dmitry’s trash is different from the rumors? I do not. During my time in the West, so many things changed in Dmitry.”</p>
<p>In the last few years, Roman Dmitry’s transformation had been shocking. He denied the truth at first, but the rumors forced him to accept it. And everyone told him how they wished to have an older brother like him. However, Rodwell Dmitry, who remembered his time with his brother, fell into a sense of alienation.</p>
<p>“In my life, Roman Dmitry was nothing more than an idiot. Yet he is now called the Hero of Cairo. People applaud Dmitry for his bright future, but I will never entrust my future to someone whom I hate calling my brother. So I extended my period here, and I will do anything to surpass him here.”</p>
<p>He denied the reality and covered his ears. He risked his life on the battlefield and made every effort to get stronger.</p>
<p>And it will be the same now. It was a life-threatening decision to move forward, but he hoped that this would make him stronger.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry defeated Richard Nicholas. Hearing the rumors that he stood tall as the greatest in Cairo burned Rodwell’s heart.</p>
<p>Flora was speechless. She was feeling complicated. At one point, she was also confused by Roman’s personality, so she couldn’t conclude what the other person’s feelings were.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry asked,</p>
<p>“Then why are you here?”</p>
<p>Flora bit her lip.</p>
<p>What should she say? Thinking of an excuse to give, she realized she didn’t want to lie to Rodwell Dmitry. She and he were both swept up in the same fate. If Roman Dmitry hadn’t changed, the two of them would have never met on the Western Front.</p>
<p>“There was a time when I almost killed a lot of people because of my immature thoughts. And so, I decided that I needed real experience to not let that happen again. So when you asked me, I wasn’t sure. I will not ask you why. But…”</p>
<p>She looked into Rodwell’s eyes. His eyes didn’t look like the eyes of someone who had given up on life.</p>
<p>“You need to win. I hope you survive and live a meaningful life.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day of the showdown arrived. Far away, the Kronos Empire’s army was visible. Rodwell Dmitry went out of the fortress alone and looked at the enemies.</p>
<p>‘I might die today.’</p>
<p>He made his decision, and many people came. Those who dissuaded him, saying he was being reckless, sighed as they looked at Rodwell, who didn’t waver.</p>
<p>After hearing the rumors about Roman Dmitry, Rodwell, the wise man people knew, began to act like he had multiple lives.</p>
<p>He knew it too. It was dangerous this time, but if he didn’t do this, he would never become stronger.</p>
<p>‘With experience that conforms to common sense, there is no choice but to grow. Roman Dmitry is the greatest sword in Cairo. The world calls him the best in Cairo, but I don’t want to be inferior to him.’</p>
<p>People could call it an inferiority complex. But for whatever reason, Rodwell Dmitry stood there. Breathing deeply, he raised his sword that he had sharpened all night.</p>
<p><em>Chak! Chak!</em></p>
<p>Not far away, the troops of the Kronos Empire lined up, and Rodwell Dmitry stood tall. With all their focus on him, he used mana in his voice.</p>
<p>“I am Rodwell Dmitry of the Cairo Kingdom. I, Rodwell Dmitry, will request the Kronos Empire to a Battle of Great Warriors!”</p>
<p>From now on, he took a step into the crossroads of life and death.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was as Flora had expected. The Kronos Empire had no reason to refuse. They arrogantly sent an unknown swordsman.</p>
<p>“I am Osford. I will duel against you.”</p>
<p>Osford was someone who couldn’t even reach the bottom of the empire’s rankings. Yet no one from Cairo smiled at this. Unlike in Cairo, where you could pass the rankings even if you only reached the 3-star level, in Kronos, one had to be around 4-stars. It was a different world from Cairo.</p>
<p>They sent Osford as a mockery, not thinking that he was weaker than Rodwell. Besides, Rodwell wasn’t even a ranker in Cairo. Since the apparent difference in their skills was absolute, Osford was also confident.</p>
<p>And the battle started like that. As expected, Osford took the lead.</p>
<p>“How dare you?!”</p>
<p><em>“Kang!”</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>It was overwhelming. As soon as the start of the battle was announced, Osford rushed ahead, and his sword with aura didn’t allow Rodwell to catch his breath.</p>
<p>Osford was a 3-star swordsman. The Kronos Empire obtained data about the swordsmen in the western part of Cairo and found out that Rodwell was a 2-star swordsman.</p>
<p>Reaching the 2-star level in his early 20s was an impressive achievement. However, that was only a high evaluation for the future, and it wasn’t enough to threaten the Kronos Empire now. So they deliberately sent out Osford.</p>
<p>They wanted to show that Rodwell Dmitry could be overwhelmingly defeated by an unknown swordsman who was not a ranker.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuek!”</em></p>
<p>He was pushed back. Rodwell Dmitry blocked the attack with his quick reaction speed, but he couldn’t help but be pushed back by a couple of collisions. From the start, the difference between the two was obvious.</p>
<p>Osford slammed forward once again, prompting Rodwell Dmitry to defend, and as soon as his opponent blocked his attack, he kicked his stomach.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>A strong shock happened. Suppressing what was rising inside him, Rodwell Dmitry quickly tried to counterattack. But…</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p>His own forearm was cut, and blood splattered. No matter what he did, Osford responded, and with time, the wounds on his body increased. As a swordsman whose skills were recognized in Cairo, he was blocked by the empire’s walls.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry clearly had a promising future, but he had never held his breath against an unknown swordsman.</p>
<p>A weak nation—that was the reality of Cairo. The reason they couldn’t even open their mouths against the empire was that there was an overwhelming difference in power.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p>His armor was distorted from the punch. He felt dizzy. Rodwell had this urge to just collapse, but he clenched his teeth and held on until the end.</p>
<p>‘This is the expected result.’</p>
<p>The people expected a miracle. Could Rodwell win? No, it was impossible. No matter who they sent, the Kronos Empire would send someone stronger. That was what it meant to go against an empire.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for them to gather their troops, but they ruthlessly trampled on Cairo’s estate.</p>
<p>‘How the hell did Roman Dmitry defeat these beings? I cannot even handle a 3-star swordsman, but he became the sword of Cairo and defeated Butler. Obviously, the Roman Dmitry I remember isn’t that strong. But while I left for the battlefield and tried to become stronger, he reached a level that I can’t dare surpass, to the point where all my efforts seem worthless.’</p>
<p>Hearing the rumors, people praised Rodwell Dmitry. The higher Dmitry’s status was, the more he was treated well wherever he went. But he wasn’t happy. He couldn’t take Roman Dmitry’s fame seriously because he never trusted him.</p>
<p>‘This morning. I heard a report that Roman Dmitry subdued the rebels. He made the impossible possible again and proved his worth. I can no longer deny that Roman Dmitry is now an untouchable being. I’ve heard the rumors about his fame, and it proves Roman Dmitry’s worth.’</p>
<p>He also knew it—he could no longer close the gap between himself and his older brother. But even though he knew that, he still stood on the battlefield because he couldn’t accept it in his heart.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>His face was cut. There was a long cut on his cheek, but Rodwell Dmitry’s eyes didn’t waver. Looking at Osford, he rushed forward.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>“How dare this bastard?!”</p>
<p>He knew he couldn’t win this duel in the usual way, so he came up with a plan. It was the same pattern. He made a counterattack, aiming it at the opponent’s lower body.</p>
<p>After pushing him to defend with repeated attacks, he aimed at the opponent’s vital points in a different pattern than before. He gave up on his body and the pain. His entire body was stained in blood, and he couldn’t withstand it any longer.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. The attack was swift.</p>
<p>Because of his experience on the battlefield, Rodwell’s movements were bold. His attack, which moved like flowing water, pierced a gap, but Osford managed to respond well.</p>
<p>“You cheeky bastard!”</p>
<p>His sword flashed, but even so, Rodwell didn’t stop. As he continued to receive his opponent’s attacks, he accumulated data in his mind on how he had been moving until now.</p>
<p>‘At this rate, I might lose concentration.’</p>
<p>The opponent was sure that he would back down, but Rodwell clenched his teeth.</p>
<p><em>Pat.</em></p>
<p>One side of his vision was already dark. At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>Rodwell’s sword pierced his opponent’s vital points. Osford was shocked, but by the time he was about to counter, Rodwell Dmitry had already decapitated him.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Blood gushed from his cut neck.</p>
<p>During his time on the Western Front, he learned that the difference in aura doesn’t guarantee victory on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Blood flowed from his eyes. One eye was stained with terrible pain, but Rodwell Dmitry smiled, raising his middle finger at the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>“Get lost, bastard.”</p>
<p>On the second day of the three days that Roman promised, the Cairo Kingdom succeeded in overpowering the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 185 - Current Life’s Relationship (3)</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry didn’t have a very happy childhood. Although born into a noble family, his only older brother kept walking on the wrong path.</p>
<p>“I really don’t understand. How can he and Rodwell be brothers?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they are half-brothers?”</p>
<p>“What is certain is that Rodwell is in a bad situation. He has to live with that horrible Roman Dmitry for the rest of his life. If I was in Rodwell’s shoes, I would have demanded my father to drive out Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>On that day, Roman Dmitry found a slum. He went to meet his friends from the time their family was still commoners and after playing all day long, he smelled and looked filthy when he returned home.</p>
<p>It was a scene that Rodwell and the other noble kids witnessed, and the words they whispered to Rodwell stuck to him. At that time, Rodwell was still a child.</p>
<p>He had lived all his life as a noble so he could not understand Roman, who undermined their family’s status.</p>
<p>‘Why is he living like that? I know that we were commoners once, but we are nobles now. It wouldn’t be too much if he tried to live with a little bit of dignity, but Roman still chooses to do things that ridicule our family. I cannot accept such a person as my older brother.’</p>
<p>He was angry. No matter what achievements he attained, the label of having commoner origins was always attached to them. It was all because of the rumors about Roman Dmitry, and Rodwell couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>From then on, he desired to be the successor. Rumors said that if Roman inherited the Lord’s position, the Dmitry family would be ruined. So Rodwell swung his sword all night long, and he worked in the forge all morning.</p>
<p>Every time he hit the steel, anger rose inside of him. Rodwell understood Roman Dmitry. He was once a commoner, so he couldn’t abandon the life he once had. But on the other hand, what about his younger siblings? His younger siblings, who were born as nobles, were being dragged into his selfish recollections of his commoner days. It was a world they never experienced but made people point at them.</p>
<p>Rodwell knew what it felt like, so he wanted to make sure his younger brother didn’t feel the same humiliation. He had to be the brother their youngest was proud of. So he worked hard to become an aura swordsman and entered the Royal Academy.</p>
<p>He had a life that people looked up to. Everything was perfect, at least until the rumors spread that Roman Dmitry had defeated Homer.</p>
<p><em>Kiiik.</em></p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>The gates opened and Rodwell Dmitry stepped inside. Blood was flowing down from his left eye, which had deep sword wounds, and every part of his body had injuries. Just the fact that he could walk was already amazing.</p>
<p>As the cheers of the soldiers on the fortress walls sounded muffled, Rodwell suppressed his memories. He still couldn’t accept his brother’s existence. It seemed that unless he saw Roman Dmitry in person, he would never be able to shake off the emotions from his childhood.</p>
<p>And at that moment, there were people who went out to meet him. They were Count Vandenberg, the leaders, and Flora.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry walked up to Flora.</p>
<p>“My role is done. Will the plan succeed?”</p>
<p>He asked a humble question, not losing eye contact.</p>
<p>Seeing him straight in the eye, Flora nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, definitely.”</p>
<p>A confident voice.</p>
<p>From now on, it was time for them to lure their enemies into the trap.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even after their defeat in the Battle of Great Warriors, Kronos didn’t waver at all. From the moment they sent Osford, it was just simple entertainment for them. Their victory was a natural result, and even if one of them was defeated, they didn’t doubt their win.</p>
<p>Rather, anger rose. Count Fabio, the commander of Kronos, marched forward.</p>
<p>“Prepare the Flares!”</p>
<p>“Starting now, the Flares and the magicians will attack and break down the enemy’s walls.”</p>
<p>It was as they had expected. The war magicians came out, and from the top of the fortress’s wall, Flora watched them.</p>
<p>‘If the magician is more than 300 meters away from the magic traps, they cannot be killed right away. The farther the explosion range is, the weaker the power of the traps is, and it is certain that they will use shields to protect themselves right after they explode. As planned, the margin of error is around 100 meters. If the magicians on top of the traps are defenseless when they cast their magic, we can wipe out their existence with a single blow.’</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The magicians moved, and their location was not as they had planned. It was possible to identify the location of their enemies during the Battle of Great Warriors, but the miracle of them standing on top of the magic traps didn’t happen. Their location was about 150 meters away from the magic traps. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but that didn’t change Flora’s plans.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg asked,</p>
<p>“Flora. When will you explode the magic traps?”</p>
<p>“They’ll have enough time to prepare if the explosion happens too soon. Magicians become vulnerable at the moment they cast their magic. If we aim for that perfect timing to set off the magic traps, the backflow of mana will render those war magicians immobile.”</p>
<p>“I get it. Just give me the signal.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Their nerves were on edge. First, Cairo’s soldiers moved. By directing them to attack from a distance, it showed that the Cairo Kingdom would respond normally.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The arrows that were shot through the sky didn’t reach the magicians. Most of them couldn’t even get close and fell, and the arrows that landed near the magicians lost their power.</p>
<p>At that moment, an aura of mana rose around the magicians. Until their magic reached its peak, the war magicians didn’t notice the existence of the magic traps.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Their manas shone brightly, and at that moment, Flora shouted,</p>
<p>“Now!”</p>
<p>“Explode it!”</p>
<p>The magic traps were triggered. Just before the magic of the magicians manifested, there was a huge explosion.</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t something anyone could react to. Flora had installed layers of magic traps in specific locations, and the series of explosions completely wiped out everything.</p>
<p>The magic of the war magicians was canceled in that shock, and they all coughed up blood. Before long, many died from the explosion.</p>
<p>Flora’s plan was a success. It was a plan that began with the Battle of Great Warriors, and now they have succeeded in removing the powerful weapon of the Kronos Empire. But…</p>
<p>“It is fine. This only makes me angrier. The Cairo Kingdom is currently in a civil war. How dare those bugs think they can stand up to the Kronos Empire?!”</p>
<p>“Woaahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>The command was given. They were only able to remove one weapon called the war magicians. At the sight of the enemies flocking towards them, dark clouds rolled over the Western Front.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a blood-curdling sight. Not long after, the army of the empire stormed into the walls, straddled a dozen ladders, and quickly climbed up the walls.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>“Push the ladders!”</p>
<p>Cairo’s soldiers were desperate. They were pushing down the ladders that were being set up on the walls, and some soldiers threw hot water and arrows at the enemies. It was clear that they had the advantage. They managed to reduce a significant number of enemy troops with this method, but this didn’t guarantee their victory.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the empire didn’t stop. They continuously climbed the ladders, and soon they were able to set foot on the walls.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>An arrow pierced the enemies. It was Flora. Equipped with clothes for war, she aimed her arrow and climbed up the wall to deal with enemies one by one.</p>
<p>“Do not lose focus! The enemies have lost their war magicians! The fight is in our favor!”</p>
<p>She screamed loudly. Blood and death—screams could be heard from everywhere. There was no way to know whose side was screaming, but Flora wasn’t shaken.</p>
<p>Right after she arrived in the capital, Flora had two teachers. One was a professor teaching tactics at the Royal Academy, and the other was a commander who was called ‘Sharpshooter’ in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>She experienced war in Lawrence. Her plan, which she thought would work, collapsed with a single Flare, and looking back now, her decision almost cost them their lives.</p>
<p>Why? Couldn’t she have thought of the Flare? No matter how financially overwhelming their opponent was, she should have considered the existence of the Flare.</p>
<p>So she studied tactics in order to make the right decision in similar situations, and she learned archery because she knew that war is ruled by logic. No matter how plausible her tactics were, she needed the power to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Flora didn’t want to be a commander. She wanted to become a being who could defeat the enemy by joining forces with the soldiers.</p>
<p>Her pretty hands became ugly. Even though her fingers now had scars and calluses, she wasn’t ashamed of her hands because these hands would bring her results.</p>
<p>The arrow that left her hand pierced the enemy’s head.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“Do not pull back! The moment the Western Front collapses, our families in Cairo will be in danger.”</p>
<p>The battle was fierce. The Kronos Empire, which appeared to be on the verge of capturing the castle at any moment, was being pushed back as time went on.</p>
<p>Once again, it was a strategic success. Count Vandenberg gave up the second line of defense and concentrated the troops here, and thanks to that, they weren’t shaken by the empire’s attacks.</p>
<p>And finally, the Kronos Empire retreated. They didn’t win the war. Their first attack was blocked, but the war had just begun.</p>
<p>On the next day, the attacks resumed. They pushed their troops to the wall, almost fell, and then ordered a retreat once again.</p>
<p>It was their last breath at the edge of a cliff. The original plan was to last five days. However, since they had to deal with the war magicians, the Western Front faced a crisis.</p>
<p>But the Kronos Empire didn’t attempt a third attack. The reason was clear—Roman Dmitry’s army of the kingdom arrived on the Western Front.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just three days. The miracle turned into reality. During the time when they thought that he was still putting an end to the rebellion, Roman Dmitry appeared on the Western Front.</p>
<p>The leaders gathered. Count Vandenberg couldn’t hide his admiration for Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… you are amazing. In just one day, you were able to clean up the rebellion of Marquis Benedict. Thanks to you, we are able to take a breather. If you had arrived later, the fate of the Western Front wouldn’t have been guaranteed.”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed. The Western Front did its best. Obviously, it resulted in a perfect situation, but the problem was that the power of the Kronos Empire was too great.</p>
<p>In the meeting room, Roman saw familiar faces—Flora with her haggard hair and Rodwell with bandages around his eyes. From the moment they saw Roman Dmitry, they both seemed agitated. Every time their eyes met, their eyes would widen, but Roman Dmitry never spoke to them, and then they would avert their gazes.</p>
<p>Looking at Count Vandenberg, Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Please assemble the troops now.”</p>
<p>“… can I please know the reason? Kronos might not attack. Marquis Benedict’s nobles’ faction, which was communicating with them, failed, and their siege in the third line of defense also failed. From what we expect, within a day or two, the enemies will likely clear this place.”</p>
<p>The war was over. It was Cairo’s victory—no, it couldn’t be called a victory. The Kronos Empire judged that there was no benefit and chose to withdraw. But Roman had other thoughts.</p>
<p>“The enemies invaded Cairo’s land. Up until now, Kronos has become accustomed to trampling on us and leaving whenever they please, but from now on, Cairo will take a hard stand against the enemy’s actions. His Majesty has entrusted me with full authority over the situation. So prepare the troops and open the gates.”</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg was shocked. He knew what Roman’s words meant.</p>
<p>“We will pursue the enemies who are returning to the empire and defeat them.”</p>
<p>It was a statement that was different from what they expected. Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 186 - Counter Attack (1)</p>
<p>Everyone doubted their ears. In a situation where the war was over, the option of opening the gates and attacking the enemy was never considered.</p>
<p>And Baron Noel said,</p>
<p>“… that is impossible. Even though we used our geographical advantage to defeat the opponents, the difference in our powers is too much. The moment we leave the city gates, Cairo will be the one suffering. And even if we can take down the Kronos Empire, will that benefit Cairo? Even if it doesn’t, the atmosphere in the kingdom is still chaotic due to the civil war, so I think now is the time for us to strengthen our internal power.”</p>
<p>The captains of the west recognized Roman Dmitry’s abilities. Seeing how he had arrived in the West in just three days, which they thought was impossible, they seemed to understand why Roman was called the Hero of Cairo.</p>
<p>He was the type of person who couldn’t be judged by normal standards. They were happy to have him, but they couldn’t agree with his plan. Even Flora Lawrence, who previously didn’t support Baron Noel, sided with him.</p>
<p>“The soldiers on the Western Front have endured a hard time in the past few days. They are  tired from watching the enemies all night, and opening the gate now is like suicide.”</p>
<p>She looked at Roman—the man who made a huge difference in her life.</p>
<p>He was never the type to speak of lies, so she clearly emphasized how dangerous this was.</p>
<p>“The Western Front is a strategic point. Our priority isn’t to kill as many forces of the Kronos Empire as possible but to protect Cairo’s safety. Roman Dmitry. Your proposal will not be accepted. If all the nobles of Marquis Benedict, who were siding with Kronos, had been handled, then the Kronos Empire would have had no reason to stay. It will be a huge risk for us to walk out and fight with someone as powerful as them.”</p>
<p>It was a valid argument. The war was over. As always, it was time to focus on cleaning up the aftermath of the war. But…</p>
<p>“Do you really think that is the best choice?”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He wasn’t going to accept the general opinion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The captains of the West—their words and their reactions were the same as the King’s. On the way to the Western Front, he had spoken to the King, who reacted with concern.</p>
<p>[… you want to attack the Kronos Empire as soon as you arrive on the Western Front?]</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>[That is a reckless move. Even if the Kronos Empire attacked us, we do not have the power to do the same. Defeating enemies in a war is a different matter. If we attack the Kronos Empire first, which is aiming for our land, they will use this as a dispute between the nations and invade us again. And the truth will never work for us. Regardless of who made the first mistake, Cairo’s safety cannot be guaranteed.]</p>
<p>It was the reality of the weak. Even if their actions were the same, the results were different depending on the logic of power. The Kronos Empire has always invaded Cairo’s borders despite being criticized by international forces, and Cairo would never be able to respond to them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they didn’t have the desire to take revenge. Anger rose whenever their people died, but Cairo’s survival was more important, so they chose to stay silent.</p>
<p>Roman understood it. The reality of a small nation was hard to accept, but the situation is different now.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. The Cairo Kingdom experienced the pain of having its flesh cut due to this civil war. The army of the kingdom had a cause and punished the rebels, but the killings that occurred in the process were cruel in the eyes of the people. We have a lot of work to do in the future to become united. Once the remnants of the nobles have been cleaned up, we will have to decide what to do with the empire’s spies. At that time, what justification will the King present to the people? Will you be able to pull out your sword to deal with the Kronos Empire, which directly attacked the borders? Or will you just stand by? A slaughter that has lost its justification cannot garner the support of the people.”</p>
<p>It was an obscure problem. The Kronos Empire openly joined the rebellion. They invaded the borders because of Marquis Benedict, but the Cairo Kingdom didn’t even touch them.</p>
<p>Then, what did the empire’s spies do? Marquis Benedict declared rebellion, so there was a justification for going against their faction, but would it make sense to subdue the rebels without touching the empire that sided with them?</p>
<p>If the civil war was prolonged, then people’s dissatisfaction would grow. And the royal family, which has remained silent to the empire, led a massacre.</p>
<p>“Cairo is at a crossroads. By clearing the nobles, we have unified the power system within the nation, and in the future, we will not repeat the same mistake on the Southern Front. Now is the chance to gain the trust of the people. Attack the Kronos Empire. Show them how wrong they were to use the civil war to invade our borders and that Cairo can wreak havoc too. Even if our action is a problem to the international community, there aren’t that many chances to secure such a situation.”</p>
<p>His voice was strong. Right after the rebellion was sorted out, there was a chance for change. Roman Dmitry knew that the kingdom wouldn’t change in just one step.</p>
<p>From a weak nation, they had to rise into a strong one. And he decided he wouldn’t show mercy to the nobles of the Kronos Empire, unlike before.</p>
<p>“The Cairo Kingdom cannot be swayed by the empire forever. Just one time. If Cairo shows that we have changed by even one percent, then from henceforth, Kronos will be wary about choosing to attack us. We must not fear what this war will bring. If a war will happen anyway, the right time is when the Kronos Empire forms an alliance with the nobles.”</p>
<p>Beyond the screen, the King fell silent. Roman Dmitry was a difficult subject. He constantly put himself at the crossroads of a choice and took on responsibilities that were difficult for him to handle.</p>
<p>A united nation was Daniel Cairo’s dream. Was he drunk on Roman Dmitry? After thinking for a while, he made a decision for Cairo.</p>
<p>[Your words are right. If Cairo moves forward in the right direction, I will have to prove to the people that my decision is right. The Kronos Empire invaded our borders. If we leave them alone, as they openly came to us in the middle of a civil war, the people will think that the civil war is simply a meaningless massacre for the power of the Cairo royal family. Roman Dmitry. I will take full responsibility for this. Go to the West and make them pay the price for invading our borders.]</p>
<p>The weak King showed his will.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry looked at him and did his best as the commander.</p>
<p>“I will execute your orders.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And at the present, the captains of the West looked at Roman Dmitry. When asked if it was the best choice, they weren’t sure.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“Those of you who have been on the Western Front know the truth. Saying that there is no benefit in pursuing the Kronos Empire, saying that going out is dangerous, saying that the soldiers are tired—they all mean nothing. Don’t you all know? Due to the conflict with the Kingdoms’ Alliance, the Kronos Empire’s eyes were on the South, and the enemies were unable to exert their full strength. Furthermore, the recent siege has resulted in the loss of many soldiers on their side, so the Kronos we will face now is weaker.”</p>
<p>Roman picked up on the truth that they chose not to see. For those who didn’t have the courage to open the gates, he showed them the truth.</p>
<p>“The benefit of this decision is that one truth is all we need. And to show that Cairo will not just watch the Kronos Empire commit wrong deeds. If they openly conspire with Marquis Benedict and we are able to take our revenge on them, the people of Cairo will look at us in a different light. They will believe that the Cairo royal family protects them. We must attack our enemies for that.”</p>
<p>Roman’s words agitated everyone. Only then did they discover that Roman Dmitry was different from them. If they were hoping to find stability before their eyes, the Hero of Cairo was fighting for a new future for the kingdom.</p>
<p>Choosing to courageously open the gates wasn’t normal. Since it has never been allowed in history, no one could speak out. Even so, their eyes were burning with desire.</p>
<p>The words spoken by Roman Dmitry set fire to their hearts. How long had they wished for a different future? They had previously been unable to unite due to the power system, but now that it has been demolished, things will be different in the future.</p>
<p>As Roman said, this was a chance. The eyes of the captains focused on one place—Count Vandenberg.</p>
<p>He smiled. The rumors were true. Roman Dmitry was the man who would bring storms and great change to Cairo.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“So what do I need to do?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The meeting was over. It went as Roman wanted. Hearing that a scouting team would be sent as soon as the sun rose tomorrow, Flora went out and looked at the dark sky.</p>
<p>‘… Roman Dmitry.’</p>
<p>He was a really consistent man. Even in the war with Barco, he chose a method they hadn’t thought of, and this time he showed the same attitude. In the meantime, even though she studied enough books for war, Flora didn’t dare fight back.</p>
<p><em>Thump.</em></p>
<p>Her heart pounded. This wasn’t a rational thrill. As a fellow human being and as someone who studied tactics, she acknowledged how great Roman Dmitry was.</p>
<p>‘I have made a lot of progress all this time. I thought I was a little different from when I was innocent, but Roman Dmitry is at a point where I cannot even look at him. How can I be like this? Whenever I hear anything about Roman Dmitry, I am so shocked by his choices and his ability to execute them.’</p>
<p>She admired Roman Dmitry. If she hadn’t met him, she would have been stuck to the estate like a flower in a greenhouse, but now she was living her own life and creating a life for a person named Flora Lawrence.</p>
<p>Everyone had stopped calling her the Flower of Lawrence. When Flora Lawrence remembered her old self, she was satisfied with this new reality.</p>
<p>She still regretted her past mistakes. But because of that choice, she was now confident, and she had no intention of denying what had happened.</p>
<p>But there was a bit of sadness. She wanted Roman Dmitry, whom she hadn’t seen for a long time, to know that she had changed.</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow, we will face the empire for the first time on the plains. No matter how weakened they are, Kronos is an opponent we can’t take lightly. Things might not work out as we hope, and in the worst case, the third line of defense will fall. I need to calculate the variables that will happen on the battlefield tonight. Just because we will follow Roman Dmitry’s words, it doesn’t mean we should be blinded by them.’</p>
<p>Tonight, she had a lot of things to do. Flora Lawrence was going to war, and she had to be prepared.</p>
<p>Just one mistake. In the past, she might have acted on her emotions, but now she was close to being a perfectionist.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p>“… Uh?”</p>
<p>Far away, she saw two men talking under the night sky. One was Roman Dmitry, and the other was Rodwell Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 187 - Counterattack (2)</p>
<p>During the meeting, if Flora Lawrence had positive emotions then Rodwell had confused ones.</p>
<p>‘…that person is Roman Dmitry?’</p>
<p>The commander of the kingdom’s army. When he appeared, the soldiers of the Western Front opened the road on both sides and let out cheers. Roman Dmitry was a symbol of hope. His arrival on the Western Front in just three days meant that Cairo was no longer in danger of being attacked by the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>Even though they didn’t know much about Roman Dmitry, his actions in the past of defeating the Hector Kingdom, becoming the greatest sword in Cairo, and even taking down Marquis Benedict, caused the people to have complete faith in him.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming sight. Rodwell Dmitry, who went into battle despite his injured body, looked at the scene with trembling eyes. It made no sense. The existence that was looked up to by the people was different from the Roman Dmitry he knew.</p>
<p>And then the meeting that followed. It was one surprise after another. Seeing him press on the captains and asking them to do their best made him recall his memories.</p>
<p>‘The Roman Dmitry I remember is a drunkard. He lived a life far from the sword and it was common for him to be dragged out of a bar by guards. There isn’t that much of a difference between then and now, so how can a person change so much in such a short amount of time?’</p>
<p>Common sense would say it was impossible. While listening to the rumors, he was always curious as to how the existence in his mind had risen to 5-stars.</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry’s voice and face. He was sure of it. Even though his appearance was a lot better, the marks on his face proved he was indeed Roman.</p>
<p>Actually, he had come to accept this reality to some extent. Even if the rumors were just half true, Roman Dmitry would no longer be called the trash of Dmitry.</p>
<p>And during the entire meeting, he looked at Roman Dmitry. As he listened to everything he was saying, he was getting more confused.</p>
<p>Soon, the meeting ended. Breathing in the night air, Rodwell Dmitri looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>‘… I lived with the single thought of raising my family’s name on the Western Front. But Roman Dmitry made all of my achievements here worthless. Is this the difference in our talent? Everyone called me the future of the Dmitry estate, but I am nothing more than a mess.’</p>
<p>He accepted it. Roman Dmitry, it was clear that his brother was better. Even calling the man who had lived like trash his brother made his stomach churn, so he worked hard, but now it felt like the difference between them was collapsing.</p>
<p>His left eye was sore. As a reward for defeating an existence that was nothing compared to the opponents Roman Dmitry had defeated, Rodwell lost his left eye.</p>
<p>It was a disaster. What had he been striving for?</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p>“Rodwell.”</p>
<p>He heard a familiar voice, and all the hair on his body stood up. When Rodwell Dmitry turned his head, he looked at the older brother in his memory staring at him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A clear face and a manly voice—it was Roman Dmitry. Unlike his face, which reminded him of the past, Roman gave off the atmosphere of not wanting people to touch him.</p>
<p>“I heard your eye isn’t in the best condition.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Rodwell looked shocked. Roman, who had pretended like Rodwell didn’t exist since he had stepped foot on the Western Front, was now asking him this.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about it.”</p>
<p>“With your sacrifice, they were able to deal with the war magicians of the Kronos Empire. You did well. If you hadn’t carried out that plan, the Western Front wouldn’t have held on until I arrived.”</p>
<p>Rodwell kept his mouth shut. It was awkward. This conversation and this situation. Roman Dmitry, who appeared in front of him as his older brother, felt so unfamiliar.</p>
<p>And it was the same with Roman. However, he spoke first.</p>
<p>‘Rodwell Dmitry, my flesh and blood.’</p>
<p>Last year, his father told him the same thing over and over again. Rodwell has been self-assured since he was a child and has always tried to get things done in his own way, but in the end, he was still in his 20s. So he hoped Roman would take care of him.</p>
<p>He knew that the relationship between the brothers wasn’t the best given the issue of succession, but from his father’s point of view, they were both his precious children.</p>
<p>The word ‘blood’ wasn’t a pleasant topic for Roman Dmitry, no, Baek Joong-hyuk. He was forced to compete because he was the son of the Heavenly Demon, and he had to rise to the top.</p>
<p>But this life was different because Roman Dmitry accepted new relationships. Those who remembered the existence of Dmitry’s trash looked at him with prejudiced eyes, but they never rejected his new self.</p>
<p>One by one, he made connections in his current life—Hans, Chris, Kevin, and even Flora Lawrence.</p>
<p>And then he met Rodwell Dmitry. The stories he heard had proven that he hated Roman, but he didn’t care.</p>
<p>‘When I started this new life, Hans gave me blind feelings for just one reason: I am Roman Dmitry. I could have rejected and hated myself like everyone else, but thanks to Hans’s approach, I was able to adapt quickly to this world. The same goes for my relationship with Rodwell Dmitry. There is no reason for me to unconditionally wait for the other person to approach me. I need to renew my relationship with him, just as I have forged new relationships with the ties I had in my present life.’</p>
<p>Dmitry’s second son.</p>
<p>He looked at his younger brother. Whatever he was thinking about him, Roman Dmitry wanted to approach him first. It wasn’t because of their father’s request. There was only one reason: Rodwell was his younger sibling. And for that alone, Rodwell Dmitry deserved to get inside his own walls.</p>
<p>Unlike in his previous life, where he and his siblings had to kill each other, he accepted them as a family in his current life.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“I am not going to be kind anymore, but keep one thing in mind.”</p>
<p>He looked into Rodwell’s eyes. Even though he didn’t show it, Rodwell lost an eye when he was still in his early 20s. And it wasn’t something to be ignored. Even if he was reacting calmly now, the bitterness of losing his eye would sink in.</p>
<p>“You are my younger brother. If you follow me into the battlefield, I will show you what it means to live as a Dmitry. In exchange for Roman Dmitry’s younger brother losing his eye, the Kronos Empire will have to sacrifice countless lives.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Rodwell’s eyes twitched. He didn’t expect any of it—Roman talking to him first and saying those words.</p>
<p>Just as Hans accepted him, Roman was going to embrace Rodwell too.</p>
<p>“So remember. The fact that you and I are brothers.”</p>
<p>A night full of stars. The two brothers reunited like that.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, the Kronos Empire was in a dire situation.</p>
<p>[… Benedict’s rebellion was a complete failure. Now that Roman Dmitry and the kingdom’s troops have arrived on the Western Front, the Kronos Empire has no reason to waste any more time. I think it would be better for us to return.]</p>
<p>It was Baron Charlton, who belonged to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>He was as annoyed as Count Fabio. He couldn’t let the troops retreat.</p>
<p>“Fucking bugs. We will attack the Western Front, and it should collapse in a day. Baron Charlton. It isn’t that I do not understand the reason for the retreat call, but we have suffered huge damage in the past few days. Does it make sense to run away without doing anything? Just give me a day. Before that, I will make sure to show them what an empire is compared to them.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a matter of winning or losing. Right after the Battle of Great Warriors, and watching the magicians get annihilated by the magic traps, Count Fabio knew they fell into a trap. He couldn’t blame the opponent.</p>
<p>The Cairo Kingdom sent out their warrior, and it was a fair battle. It was because of the empire’s actions that they lost their magicians.</p>
<p>And that was why he hated it. When he thought that his actions were what got them into this mess, he felt horrible. Just once, he wanted to get revenge. Aside from the practical benefits, it was a matter of pride.</p>
<p>[I am aware of Count Fabio’s feelings. However, the opponent is Roman Dmitry and his army. The man is quite an odd character, and if we do anything wrong, we might end up with more damage. Count Fabio, the empire is focusing on the conflict with the Kingdoms’ Alliance. If Count Fabio loses his troops, the aftermath is inevitably going to affect the South. Think carefully, should we continue this war?]</p>
<p>“… Uhm.”</p>
<p>Count Fabio showed an expression that said he wasn’t fine with it. He wasn’t wrong. They fought with the troops on the Western Front in this war.</p>
<p>If they suffered great damage in the war with the Cairo Kingdom, they would have no choice but to bring in troops from other places to handle the situation, and the responsibility of that couldn’t be avoided. Their defeat against the Cairo Kingdom was not enough, and the Kingdoms’ Alliance would not let it pass.</p>
<p>“Damn it. I understand. As soon as the sun rises tomorrow, we will recall the troops.”</p>
<p>Count Fabio accepted it. His stomach churned in rage, but what could he do? There was no other way.</p>
<p>[You made the right decision.]</p>
<p>And that was the end. Count Fabio cut off the communication.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the next day, the Kronos Empire chose to retreat. They organized their camps early in the morning and chose to retreat before the sun rose in the middle of the sky.</p>
<p>“Commander, I will leave the scouts behind, just in case something happens.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for that.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be dangerous? If the Cairo Kingdom sends us a pursuit team, we might end up having our tails bitten.”</p>
<p>The man’s advice was correct. They needed to leave some scouts behind to see how the enemy was moving instead of just withdrawing.</p>
<p>Normally, Count Fabio would have listened. However, having spent a frustrating time last night, he looked angry.</p>
<p>“Do you think that a nation like Cairo will send someone to pursue the Kronos Empire? The reason the enemies were able to deal with us is because of their wall. If they open their gates and send a team after us like what you said, we can just defeat the Western Front.”</p>
<p>In the wide lands, there was no place to protect themselves. In a situation where they would have to collide head-on, there was no way Kronos would be defeated.</p>
<p>Rather, he wanted them to come out. If Cairo made that mistake, they would pay the price for their complacency.</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant withdrew. He also agreed with his words. Leaving the scouts behind was a precaution, but there was no way that they could threaten Kronos.</p>
<p>Was that why? The reason why the Kronos Empire also decided to call back all of their troops?</p>
<p>Usually, in preparation for enemy attacks, they would move in formation as close to each other as possible, but now they just formed a long procession line. The moment they would get attacked, there was a risk that they would be cut off in the middle. However, despite knowing that, the Kronos Empire made a bold move.</p>
<p>‘Cairo Kingdom. It may seem that the world is yours now as you clean up the rebellion, but it is just a matter of time before you become a vassal state of the empire. Cairo is a starting bridge for us to conquer the continent. The moment Kronos appears on the Western Front again, it will be unstoppable.’</p>
<p>Count Fabio grinned. It was a little comforting to know that their revenge would take place in the future. Trudging along the path, he pictured the future of Cairo in his mind.</p>
<p>How long was it? Just as the sun had risen in the middle of the sky and shone, the lieutenant who withdrew earlier, ran up with a pale face.</p>
<p>“Commander! Enemies have appeared! Enemies are attacking the rear!”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Count Fabio doubted his ears. Enemies attacked from the rear. Did that mean that they opened their gates?</p>
<p>“Right. The people of Cairo made a stupid mistake.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p><em>Neigh!</em></p>
<p>He pulled the reins of his horse. If the enemies have come out….</p>
<p>“Order the soldiers. Kill every worm of Cairo!”</p>
<p>… Count Fabio judged that this was the golden chance.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 188 - Counterattack (3)</p>
<p>Two hours ago, Roman Dmitry received a report on Kronos’s movement from the scouts. He spread out a map in the conference room.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>“As expected, the Kronos Empire chose to retreat. We sent scouts to check if it was a trap, but they couldn’t find any strange movements of them luring us in. The enemies are currently moving through the plains and through the passages marked here. Because of the overgrown terrain, the enemy needs to prepare for the attack of pursuers but they are maintaining a rather loose formation.”</p>
<p>“They are completely off guard.”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Kronos Empire is clearly aware that they are not safe. So it’s only natural for them to form a tight formation, but they must have completely ruled out that we would pursue them.”</p>
<p>It was an obvious disregard. Outside the walls was a space where there was no need to be afraid of Cairo. Cairo had been invaded several times but regardless of the outcome, Cairo had never sent a pursuit team. And both sides knew it well—the fact that Cairo was just barely enduring its forts to survive, and that they would be unilaterally massacred by the Kronos Empire if they walked out.</p>
<p>So they organized a pursuit team. It was necessary so they could show them that they had changed.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“Our plan is simple. The enemies are keeping a long line as they move, so we plan to divide our forces into two and attack the middle and rear at once. If we cut the middle, the enemies will wander, and we will have a chance to devour the back and the front, and then we can reduce the number of enemies before they can respond.”</p>
<p>“…it’s a good plan, but the problem is when will the troops get isolated.”</p>
<p>It was Baron Noel. Roman’s words were just the possible outcome if things go as planned.</p>
<p>“If the enemy resists, the plan goes wrong. The troops attacking in the middle will become isolated, and that is a chance for them to reverse their attack on us. Wouldn’t it be better to join forces and attack right from the rear? If the enemies unite and respond, it will turn into an all-out war from then on, but a safe hit-and-run strategy can avoid extreme situations. Our goal is easy. Even if we don’t annihilate them, causing enough damage should show them what we mean.”</p>
<p>“No. That will not be enough.”</p>
<p>In this plan, he didn’t want half-baked results. They had to show what would happen to them if they touched Cairo.</p>
<p>“With this attack, we must obtain a record that can be called a great victory. To do so, attacking from both sides is necessary, and it is important to break the ranks of the enemy with a surprise attack. Just like what Baron Noel said, it is true that there are risks involved, but from the moment we open the gates and step out, we have to take some risks.”</p>
<p>And Roman Dmitry firmly added as he looked at the people in the room,</p>
<p>“I will take on the attack in the middle. Undoubtedly, based on the strength that they showed, they can’t withstand our attacks. Their carelessness and the move that we have never made until now will plunge Kronos into the abyss.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. If it was Roman Dmitry, the leaders of the Western Front decided to follow him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the sun rose in the middle of the sky, the plan started. Count Vandenberg’s men, who followed through a shortcut, hid in the bushes and waited for the signal.</p>
<p><em>Pung!</em></p>
<p><em>Pung!</em></p>
<p>The flares burst into the sky, and Count Vandenberg drew his sword.</p>
<p>“Everyone attack!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“Wahhhh!”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p><em>Tatatak!</em></p>
<p>It was a surprise attack. Seeing Cairo’s soldiers rush at them, Kronos’s soldiers hurriedly pulled their weapons with shocked faces. However, they had no choice but to be helplessly overpowered by an attack they did not prepare for.</p>
<p>As soon as they collided with Cairo’s men, screams were heard, and Kronos’s soldiers felt like they couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>One soldier of the Kronos Empire widened his eyes. As he coughed up blood, he looked at the sword lodged in his stomach.</p>
<p>That was just the start. Cairo’s soldiers quickly dealt with the enemies with their numerical advantage, and it was easy to block and drive their swords into their enemies’ bodies. In an instant, living beings that had just been alive became rags.</p>
<p>Since their swords were unable to pierce their enemies’ chain armor, Cairo’s soldiers held their enemies’ heads and decapitated them. It was the brutality of war.</p>
<p>Every part of the ground was dyed red, and it seemed that Count Vandenberg’s forces had completely taken control of the rear.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“You bastards! Your opponent is Cairo! Do not fall for their tricks!”</p>
<p>A knight of the Kronos Empire shouted. He infused aura on his sword and charged at Cairo.</p>
<p>From that point on, the atmosphere changed. The empire’s army, which was unsure of what was going on and stepping back, was calmly responding against the soldiers of Cairo, who were flooding in like crazy.</p>
<p>Gradually, Kronos had the upper hand. When a similar number of soldiers clashed with them, Cairo was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Kronos’s and Cairo’s soldiers showed a great difference. If the soldiers of Kronos fought aggressively, the soldiers of the Cairo Kingdom were mere ragtag troops who only knew how to fight within the walls.</p>
<p>They only gained momentum with the surprise attack for a brief moment. When Kronos regained their balance and showed their true form, Cairo was back to feeling weak.</p>
<p>At the same time, Count Vandenberg showed his outstanding strength. He used his 4-star aura and slashed the enemies, but then he noticed that things were taking a strange turn.</p>
<p>‘We will be at a disadvantage at this rate.’</p>
<p>The momentum they held was decreasing. The carelessness of the empire wasn’t arrogance. They were confident in dealing with Cairo no matter what formation they took, and this was proof of that.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg felt impatient. Realistically, it would be right to end it now and retreat with the troops, but the plan was to hold on until the end.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was attacking the middle. He was in a situation more dangerous than him, with two sides of the enemy’s troops possibly attacking him. Yet he had drawn his sword, so Count Vandenberg wasn’t going to step back from this fight.</p>
<p>“Do not back down! Show them the power of Cairo!”</p>
<p>The battlefield was bloody. Count Vandenberg fulfilled his duty as the commander.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Roman Dmitry led the troops to the middle. Unlike the struggling forces in the back, a one-sided massacre happened in the middle.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. Roman Dmitry’s sword continuously splattered blood. He rushed to the front and cut down dozens of people at once, and the soldiers following him showed the same results.</p>
<p>It was not just a simple victory by a surprise attack. After clashing a couple of times, Kronos’s men were shocked.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The soldiers of Dmitry were equally as powerful as the empire’s army. And the enlisted soldiers who followed Roman Dmitry showed outstanding performance among them.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakang!</em></p>
<p>He was just a normal soldier. An unknown soldier raised the aura on his sword and pushed back a knight from the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>They couldn’t help but be shocked. They were sure that the man was dressed as a soldier, yet he was pushing people back with aura on his sword. It was the power of the Asura technique. Those who followed Roman learned how to use aura one by one, and now even ordinary soldiers have also broken down the wall.</p>
<p><em>Cut.</em></p>
<p>The knight’s head was cut off. An ordinary soldier was able to defeat a knight.</p>
<p>“This is insane!”</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop them!”</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire’s troops were strong, but Dmitry’s soldiers were beyond normal.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. The key figures like Chris and Kevin displayed overwhelming power, and they quickly reduced the number of enemies.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg’s worries were useless. He thought that Roman would be in danger, but he was the one handling the situation the best.</p>
<p>He had an overwhelming force. He was cutting people down, and he opened up a path.</p>
<p>‘… what is this?’</p>
<p>It was a confusing situation, and one person was more shocked at what he saw.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry, who cut down an enemy, looked shocked. It made no sense at all.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was a saying in Cairo, “Go to the capital if you want to be successful.”</p>
<p>When Rodwell moved to the capital, he came to know why people said it. It was a whole new world. Unlike the rags on the borders, there were guards, a system, and tests for giving them a worthy name. Everyone was right.</p>
<p>Rodwell was called a genius, but to really succeed, he needed to make a name for himself in the capital. And that was his last memory of Dmitry. He was at the level of the capital, yet beings who had not been able to chase after him now showed a shocking sight in front of him.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>It was Dmitry’s soldier. The soldier with a normal face was pushing back the army of the Kronos Empire and drove his sword through their hearts.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the empire were known to be strong. From what Rodwell remembered, it was normal for Dmitry’s level to be unable to stand up to the empire’s troops, but they were now struggling with just one of Dmitry’s soldiers.</p>
<p>The soldier didn’t seem special either. None of them were even wearing any special uniform—just the uniform of Dmitry—yet they were not being pushed back.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. Chris, Rodwell remembered him. Dmitry’s genius turned into a monster in a span of a couple of years.</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Chris splattered blood. The knights of Kronos rushing with their auras were no match for the man, and he kept taking people down.</p>
<p>A gap in his memories rose. The ordinary-looking soldiers and even Chris—they were all different from what Rodwell remembered. Since he was a member of the Dmitry family, he couldn’t understand all of these changes.</p>
<p>And the one who stood out the most was Roman Dmitry. His power wasn’t shocking but astonishing. He proved why he was given the title of the Greatest Sword in Cairo.</p>
<p>“You are my younger brother. If you follow me into the battlefield, I will show you what it means to live as a Dmitry. In exchange for Roman Dmitry’s younger brother losing his eye, the Kronos Empire will have to sacrifice countless lives.”</p>
<p>Roman’s words lingered in his mind. He wasn’t sure what he meant back then, but now he did. The Dmitry family was entirely different. The family, whose name was known only on the borders, was completely changed by Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand how it happened. What was certain was that what was in front of him was the truth, and while he was on the Western Front, Dmitry went through many changes. It confused him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure how to handle this situation. Rodwell went to the battlefield with one of his eyes covered, but there was no role that needed him there. It was then…</p>
<p>“Chris!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Far away, the troops of the empire were pouring in. Due to the fact that it was a surprise attack, the soldiers who were around the middle flocked.</p>
<p>Roman slashed the enemies as he said,</p>
<p>“From now on, divide the troops into two as planned. You lead the troops and head to the rear. While you help Count Vandenberg there, I will block Kronos’s army from coming this way.”</p>
<p>It was a reckless plan. Rodwell wanted to stop them. But those who gave the orders and those who accepted them fought. They all wanted to take the risk.</p>
<p>“Alright. Group 2, follow me now!”</p>
<p>Chris backed off.</p>
<p>And after that, Roman stayed there, attacking the enemies.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Roman’s aura exploded, and he threw himself at the enemies that were flooding in.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 189 - Counterattack (4)</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>An arrow pierced straight through the forehead of an imperial soldier. Flora Lawrence quickly put another arrow on the bowstring and focused her eyes on the surroundings.</p>
<p>‘We are being pushed back.’</p>
<p>It was as expected. Joining Count Vandenberg’s forces, she did expect that the surprise attack wouldn’t give them too much of an advantage. Anyone with a brain and common sense could guess that.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the Kronos Empire differed in quality right from the start, and that issue was already discussed too. In conclusion, they bet on the odds. Despite knowing they were at a disadvantage, Cairo’s soldiers went ahead with the plan.</p>
<p>“Commander!”</p>
<p>Flora shouted.</p>
<p>She calculated the variables that would happen on the battlefield all night long and presented a plan on how to respond to them. But there was a backlash from the captains. They said it went against the purpose of the plan, but Flora decided that her plan was the perfect way to use the weapon called Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And hearing Flora’s cry, Count Vandenberg raised his voice.</p>
<p>“Put up a Shield Wall right now!”</p>
<p>“Create a Shield Wall!”</p>
<p>The orders were spread quickly, and the soldiers of Cairo, who were scattered in all directions, gathered in one place. Among them, the soldiers with shields stepped forward to form a wall with square shields.</p>
<p>It happened quickly. They didn’t prepare for a long time because they had practiced such things before coming to the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>There was a rapidly rising wall of shields. The Kronos Empire had a puzzled expression. The Shield Wall was a strategy commonly used on the battlefield, but it wasn’t a formation suitable for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>Hearing Flora’s operation, Baron Noel said,</p>
<p>“Flora. Speed is important for this mission. The Shield Wall is a way to bridge the gap in our powers, but it will be dangerous for the troops attacking in the middle if we waste time creating a defense formation. We also need to make sacrifices and be aggressive. That way, the surprise attack can at least proceed without any issues.”</p>
<p>It was a valid opinion. Flora didn’t deny it, but one fact separated their opinions—her faith in Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Flora Lawrence was confident that Roman Dmitry would make a difference even if they were attacked on both sides, so it was important for Cairo’s army to preserve their strength as much as possible.</p>
<p>Well, the army of the kingdom couldn’t deal with the empire’s army from the rear alone. Flora’s strong opinion was accepted, and when they were pushed back after the surprise attack, they formed a Shield Wall.</p>
<p>“Put the shield on your bodies!”</p>
<p>“Don’t allow any gaps!”</p>
<p>The battle changed. They went from attacking to defending. The Kronos Empire’s army pushed forward with the idea that they had gained momentum, and Cairo’s soldiers held on tenaciously, blocking the enemy’s attacks with their shields.</p>
<p>But they weren’t just defending. They tried to attack by thrusting their weapons into the small gaps between the shields, and Flora, along with the other archers, would fire arrows.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>Arrows rained down. The empire’s army screamed and collapsed, and Flora shook off the drops of sweat as she pulled another arrow. Her ears were deafened by the screams of people. In the past, she couldn’t look at the blood-stained world, but now she was unshaken by it.</p>
<p>The battle was fierce. Time passed by so slowly. Even after killing and killing and more killing, the number of enemies didn’t decrease, and the gaps in the Shield Wall began to widen. Every time that happened, the soldiers would have to step in to close the gap. Stepping on the corpses of their colleagues, they clenched their teeth to not let Kronos pass.</p>
<p>They felt dizzy. They kept wanting to give up under the hot sun, but they couldn’t lose their concentration in the fight for their lives.</p>
<p>It was when the heat of the battle reached its limit that Flora confirmed something in the distance and shouted with a bright face.</p>
<p>“Allies have arrived! Release the Shield Wall and attack!”</p>
<p>Far away, she noticed the allies running. It was the start of the counterattack that Cairo had been waiting for.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The captain of the troops who arrived was Chris. He appeared with troops and raised the aura on his sword as he rushed toward the enemies.</p>
<p>“Follow me!”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. The soldiers of the Kronos Empire attacked Chris, but the moment they collided, Chris’s sword tore their bodies apart. His simple sword movement gave them chills.</p>
<p>He slashed the first one down and then cut down the heads of the two that came after, and later, when the empire’s soldiers with terrified faces showed hesitation, he hurled himself at them first.</p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>“Stop him!”</p>
<p>It was definite. Dmitry’s soldiers, led by Chris, unilaterally slaughtered the Kronos Empire’s forces.</p>
<p>The battle with Barco, the Southern Front, and the civil war—Dmitry’s soldiers were veterans who had seen a lot of war, which they could not normally experience. They became bloody warriors on the battlefield and did not care if their opponents were as great as mountains, like the empires.</p>
<p>The wars they experienced were weak every time. Overcoming their fear, they went against their opponents, who looked weak and brought victories.</p>
<p>The situation was reversed. Now that they were being attacked from behind, the knight, who was leading the Kronos Empire’s army, raised his voice,</p>
<p>“Hold on a little while. Our allies will arrive. So hold on!”</p>
<p>Contrary to what he said, they were clearly at a disadvantage. And in order to reverse the situation, they had to take down Chris first.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“I will deal with you.”</p>
<p>A 3-star swordsman’s aura exploded. He slashed the soldiers who blocked him and rushed for Chris. He was so focused, despite the chaotic battles happening everywhere. Even though Chris showed a terrifying amount of strength in a short period of time, he still thought that because he was a 3-star swordsman, he would have the upper hand.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The knight’s head was blown off. The moment he appeared in front of Chris to swing his sword, he momentarily closed his eyes, and the moment he opened them, his head flew to the sky.</p>
<p>Just with one swing, he was able to take care of a 3-star swordsman. Chris didn’t use aura. He just watched the enemy approach him, and as the enemy attempted to attack, he waited for a gap.</p>
<p>Chris experienced defeating a 3-star swordsman two years ago. His skills and the experience he had gained from the past until now were huge. This was just the start.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire’s aura swordsmen ran at once. Aura raged from all sides, aiming for Chris’s life, but they were knocked out in one hit, just like earlier. In one attack, there was one death.</p>
<p>His swift sword reached its peak. Chris’s ruthlessness terrified the troops of the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>The Swift Sword of Cairo—it was the moment when his existence would make a name for itself on the continent and reveal his worth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>By the time Count Fabio arrived at the scene, it was horrendous.</p>
<p>“…W-What is this?”</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry. That person blocked their path and butchered their troops.</p>
<p>He felt goosebumps rise. They had the numerical advantage, but Roman Dmitry was able to get the upper hand.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire’s army formed a long procession. As the middle was attacked, all the soldiers who were moving in front flocked to the middle, but Roman Dmitry blocked their path. And that meant that when they arrived there, they would have to face Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>He chose to block the path alone for that reason, despite the fact that it was the worst situation to be in.</p>
<p>‘Does that mean that he can handle all of us?’</p>
<p>No other explanation was needed. The bodies under Roman Dmitry’s feet proved that his choice was correct.</p>
<p>Countless troops were already slaughtered by the time Count Fabio arrived on the scene, and even if they passed him, Dmitry’s soldiers were waiting right behind him.</p>
<p>His eyes were confused by the scene in front of him. He was surprised by Roman Dmitry’s boldness, and he couldn’t understand Dmitry’s power, which was stronger than he thought.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. The rumors were true. At first, he thought Roman Dmitry was just a frog in a well, but he was a monster hiding in plain sight. It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“Commander! The situation in the rear isn’t good! At this rate, the troops near the rear might be attacked and annihilated.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant. After receiving a call from the rear, he spoke in an urgent voice. This wasn’t the time to admire the opponent. Cairo made a bold move to come out of the city gates, and heaven sent them a chance that couldn’t be missed.</p>
<p>‘If something like Cairo can come outside to fight and do this, I will not be able to head back to the empire with a proud face. Taking advantage of Cairo’s civil war had become useless, and if the enemies’ arrogance is not punished, then Kronos will be ridiculed by the continent. I need to let go of the benefits of this battle and punish them.’</p>
<p>“Knights of Kronos.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>They were Count Fabio’s escort. They were the 10th group of the 10 Knight Troops of the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>As they looked at Count Fabio to carry out the order, he spoke in a voice seething with murderous intent.</p>
<p>“Get rid of that Roman Dmitry now. If that guy is taken down, Cairo’s troops would no longer be able to hold on, and then we will move to the rear…”</p>
<p>At that moment, Count Fabio stopped talking. It could have been an illusion, but Roman Dmitry, who was far away from him, was looking his way as if he heard Count Fabio speak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was a saying that when one comes across a beast, their body hardens. Their roar causes overwhelming fear, and Roman Dmitry’s eyes alone completely distracted him. Seeing those eyes made him go stiff. While he was giving out orders, it suddenly felt like the world had stopped.</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry cut down a soldier and kicked the ground.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. As soon as he met Count Fabio’s eyes and realized he was the commander, he rushed for him.</p>
<p>It was such a reckless decision. The distance between them wasn’t short, and along the way, there were a lot of Kronos’s soldiers. Common sense made it impossible to think he could pass through them.</p>
<p>And as expected, the empire’s army blocked his path and attacked Roman.</p>
<p>‘He is finished.’</p>
<p>He blinked, and in that fleeting moment, things changed. Roman Dmitry slaughtered the soldiers who rushed at him, and the path was now open. Their distance was shorter than before.</p>
<p>Dozens of soldiers who were willing to die to stop Roman Dmitry rushed to him. And the Knights of Kronos also rushed ahead. Even though Count Fabio wasn’t able to finish giving the order, they knew what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>And among them was a 4-star aura swordsman. His rising aura gave Kronos’s troops confidence.</p>
<p>Blood splattered. The 4-star aura swordsman’s head flew to the sky, and the faces of the other Knights of Kronos had gone pale.</p>
<p>Each time Count Fabio blinked, something shocking happened. He thought Roman Dmitry could never get close to him, but before he knew it, everything changed. Only then did he realize…</p>
<p>‘Insane bastard!’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He was sincerely going to break through the crowds and kill the commander of Kronos.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 190 - Counterattack (5)</p>
<p>100 meters, 90 meters, 80 meters… Roman Dmitry closed the distance. It felt like the nerves on his body were on edge, but Count Fabio didn’t step back. As a member of the empire, he didn’t want to show a scared image to Cairo, and above all, he was sure that he couldn’t die from this.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>It was Gustavo, the leader of the Knights of Kronos. He jumped ahead. Being in charge of the 10th unit of the Knights of Kronos, he felt that he had to handle the situation.</p>
<p>Aura shone on his sword like the sun. Without having to say anything, it proved that he was different from the other Knights of Kronos that Roman had faced until now.</p>
<p>He was fast. As he arrived in front of Roman Dmitry in an instant, he seized the moment that Roman Dmitry was cutting down an enemy and immediately attacked.</p>
<p><em>Kaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>With a single hit, a huge wave of mana could be felt. Gustavo continued to launch a series of attacks without stopping, and the two of them continued to clash.</p>
<p>It was unusual for someone to block Roman Dmitry’s sword. If he hadn’t known Gustavo’s identity, then maybe he would have uttered his surprise, but he already knew of it.</p>
<p>The Continental Ranking’s 78th and the 35th in Kronos’s ranking. He was a talent the world knew. Even though he was ranked higher than Count Nicholas, his existence couldn’t be handled by Cairo.</p>
<p>Gustavo was an example of how powerful the Kronos Empire was. The 5-star aura from his sword was strong. The other swordsmen couldn’t even attack Roman, but this man could handle him. But….</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>Roman blocked all of the opponent’s attacks. At the same time, when the Knights of Kronos attacked an opening, Roman pushed Gustavo away and cut them down at once.</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>That was the scene. And another knight who was waiting to take advantage of the situation rushed in, and Roman Dmitry cut off his chest. But killing just one didn’t bring him any relief.</p>
<p>Immediately, the other knights rushed in, and even while blocking Gustavo’s attack, he killed them all.</p>
<p>Roman was in the middle of the enemy camp. The best swordsman, Gustavo, stepped forward, and yet Kronos couldn’t land a single attack on Roman.</p>
<p>They were all running around insanely. The attacks of the powerful predators were all being stomped down by Roman Dmitry, and it was the Knights of Kronos who were collapsing first.</p>
<p>One, two… more bodies piled up. Roman was at a disadvantage, but with time, Roman Dmitry’s presence overwhelmed the enemies. It made no sense.</p>
<p>Gustavo rushed again. Handling a 5-star aura swordsman was no joke, but the opponent didn’t seem to care. It was like it didn’t even matter. Gustavo focused on one single goal—winning, but at some point, he felt that his opponent was ignoring him.</p>
<p>‘You bastard.’</p>
<p>One against many, and Gustavo was one of the many. There was nothing great about being a 5-star aura swordsman. It was just a slight advantage over the others. At the same time that his anger was rising in such a situation, Gustavo had no choice but to accept one fact.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is a more dangerous person than we think. If that guy is left alive, I don’t know how to face the wars that will come. Even if it means risking my life, I need to deal with that guy here.’</p>
<p>His eyes changed. And…</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>It was the limit. Inside Gustavo, mana began to explode.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>The nature of the attacks changed. It went from having the aura of a warm sun to one that could burn things. His power seemed to have risen twice as much as before.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry raised his mana, mirroring his opponent, and faced Gustavo.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Grrr!</em></p>
<p>A wave of mana rose. The mana immediately made the area so dangerous that normal swordsmen couldn’t get close, and the two of them kept fighting.</p>
<p>Each attack made the ground shake. The clash between the two exceeded human limits, to the point that the soldiers of the Kronos Empire collapsed on the ground due to it.</p>
<p>In this situation, Roman Dmitry felt the change—the change in Gustavo’s attack pattern.</p>
<p>‘The opponent is currently using innate qi.’</p>
<p>Innate qi. It was the qi that the human body was born with. It wasn’t the kind of power that could be generated through cultivation. It was formed naturally as human beings went through life. Aside from having a very small amount of power, innate qi was directly related to life. That just shows how much Gustavo wanted to kill Roman Dmitry, at the cost of his own life.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Roman studied the continent. As far as this world’s knowledge went, there was no way to use innate qi. Maybe it was Kronos’s secret or Gustavo’s. Only he knew the answer.</p>
<p>Gustavo showed his intent to kill Roman Dmitry with an unexpected force, but in reality, it was a force he had already experienced.</p>
<p>In his past life, there were various types of people in Murim. And among them, those who used their innate qi would sacrifice their lives to take down their enemies.</p>
<p>They also knew it. The moment that they would consume their innate qi, the end result would not be good. They might be able to survive, or at the very least live the rest of their lives with a disability, if the battle ended before they used all of their innate qi.</p>
<p>It was a forbidden power. Even the people in Murim didn’t dare touch the power of innate qi.</p>
<p>However, here on the Salamander Continent, he discovered an entity that was willingly touching something that the Murim people didn’t.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The mana was hot. Gustavo ran wild with the power he couldn’t control, but that didn’t change the result. Just like that, there was no change.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry had one year to grow, which, come to think of it, was a year ago. Roman Dmitry had already reached a new level of power and managed to become the head of the northeast.</p>
<p>He had already defeated Count Nicholas, who was stronger than Butler, yet he took his time. Then, was it only his subordinates who got stronger? No—even Roman became stronger. Just as he had reached a level that others couldn’t in one year, Roman had a different growth in the past year.</p>
<p>It was a battle of strength and power. They faced each other head-on. Even though the opponent raised his innate qi, he couldn’t push Roman away.</p>
<p>‘N-No way.’</p>
<p>Gustavo was confused. He had used his innate qi, yet he didn’t want to die or become disabled. It was a secret weapon that was not shown to the world, but he couldn’t accept the fact that he still couldn’t overwhelm the enemy.</p>
<p>The situation was abnormal, and Gustavo had gone beyond his limits. If he still couldn’t defeat the opponent, it meant that Roman Dmitry was not his opponent in the first place.</p>
<p>He had not much time now. His innate qi was decreasing fast, so Gustavo made a decision.</p>
<p>“You will not be able to stop this.”</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>He prepared for his last attack. He raised his mana. Seeing him use all of his aura as if it would be the end, Roman Dmitry also prepared himself.</p>
<p>He didn’t even need to use a mid-level technique. As if the sword technique were fully developed, the power of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art changed.</p>
<p>‘The first three forms of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art.’</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>There was a clash of strength and power. The moment Gustavo’s attack exploded, a storm of aura that shook the world engulfed the two of them.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwa.</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A thick cloud of dust rose. When the energy that swept the world subsided, people witnessed something shocking.</p>
<p>“… Gustavo has been defeated.”</p>
<p>On the ground, they could see traces of what appeared to be Gustavo. His face was so badly torn that it was impossible to identify him, and Roman Dmitry just looked down at the corpse with an indifferent face.</p>
<p>He was as strong as Count Nicholas.</p>
<p>At one time, he thought that the way people in this world used their power was wrong, but now he would admit that their way of handling their power has developed differently from Murim.</p>
<p>But that didn’t mean that he was stronger. The more he accepted the new world, the more he could change from his previous life. Roman Dmitry, as he did in Murim, entered a realm that others couldn’t touch.</p>
<p>Roman shifted his gaze. Count Fabio’s face was pale. He sat on the ground, unable to run.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman walked to him, and there was no one blocking his way. In the situation where even the proud Knights of Kronos were frightened and only looked at them, Count Fabio got up.</p>
<p>“Su-Surrender! I surrender!”</p>
<p>He gave up on his pride. He raised a white flag, but Roman Dmitry’s face didn’t change.</p>
<p>‘He is thinking of killing me.’</p>
<p>He knew it right then. Even if he surrendered, the opponent wasn’t going to spare him. Count Fabio changed his attitude. If the opponent refused to compromise, then there was only one way.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry! I am a noble of the Kronos Empire! Even during the war, Kronos will never forgive any being who touches the nobles. Do you think you can handle it? Come at me! You will have to live in fear of the empire killing you each night. Your blood will dry up, you won’t be able to sleep, and you will lose your sanity. So choose. Save me or take all the honor!”</p>
<p>He screamed loudly. He looked straight at his opponent.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Roman stopped walking.</p>
<p>“I know the cost of my choices.”</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk was a man who stood at the top. Assassinations were a daily thing for him, and he accepted all of them.</p>
<p>“So die.”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>He lodged his sword slowly and painfully.</p>
<p>As the soldiers of the empire appeared, Roman Dmitry pushed Count Fabio into the abyss of death.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Grrr!</em></p>
<p><em>Explode.</em></p>
<p>The clash between Roman and Gustavo sent shockwaves everywhere.</p>
<p>“… what is this!?”</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg, who was cutting down the enemies, was shocked at the sudden explosion. The wave of mana he felt was so unusual. Normal soldiers would have been simply startled by the sound of the explosion, but he could feel the mana in the wind.</p>
<p>‘We don’t have much time.’</p>
<p>If anything happened to Roman, the troops in the middle would face a crisis. The reason why Cairo chose to attack from both sides was to stop the enemy from getting help from the troops who were in front, but it was taking longer than expected.</p>
<p>With the help of Chris, he managed to come out victorious in the rear. But he felt something ominous in the aftermath of the explosion.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. What the commander is fearing will not happen.”</p>
<p>It was Chris.</p>
<p>Did he read his thoughts? After calming his anxiety and immediately joining the battle, Count Vandenberg was speechless.</p>
<p>‘How can he be so sure?’</p>
<p>The plan was very dangerous. Roman Dmitry took the most dangerous role, and considering the power of the Kronos Empire, it wouldn’t be a shock if something happened to him.</p>
<p>However, none of Dmitry’s soldiers seemed to be worried. The huge explosion only made them briefly turn their gaze, and soon they went back to battle.</p>
<p>He admired their blind faith. He thought that the driving force behind Dmitry’s revival was the strong ties centered on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Dmitry was a solid iron fortress. After the war was over, the Dmitry family would stand tall as the best family in Cairo. It was then….</p>
<p><em>Pang!</em></p>
<p><em>Papapang!</em></p>
<p>Far away, the signal was fired. Red to attack, yellow to retreat, and green…</p>
<p>‘Means the enemy commander has been killed.’</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes went wide. The flare was green. It was a shocking result that no one had ever thought of, enough to put Count Vandenberg’s worries to shame.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 191 - New Map (1)</p>
<p>At the time of the battle, Cairo’s Royal Palace fell into a deep silence.</p>
<p>‘The fate of Cairo depended on my choice.’</p>
<p>It was Daniel Cairo. Even after giving Roman Dmitry the command to attack, he kept asking himself whether his decision was the right one.</p>
<p>Considering the value of the kingdom, it felt like the right thing to do. However, depending on its success or failure, the price Cairo would have to pay in the future would be either heaven or hell. If successful….</p>
<p>‘A single victory will take Cairo down a completely different path than before. The people will have the pride of not bowing to Kronos and at the same time, the rebels will be organized. Aside from the conflict with Kronos, it is surely our chance to escape from the reality of being a small nation.’</p>
<p>The problem was that if it failed, it wouldn’t just end with the loss of their troops.</p>
<p>‘We mobilized all the troops to the Western Front for this war. The moment they are defeated outside the walls, the Kronos Empire will not miss the opportunity to destroy the West. If the strategically important areas are surrendered to the enemy, Kronos may change its course and directly target Cairo no matter how at odds they will be with the Kingdoms’ Alliance. The battles that have already happened before are enough justifications for war, and even if they intervened in the rebellion, there is no way we can resist them with their power.’</p>
<p>It was the worst possibility. With the kingdom’s power weakened by the civil war, defeat was obvious.</p>
<p>Ah, it was really so difficult. If he knew the answer, or if at least the cost of responsibility would be his own life, he wouldn’t be this worried if it would only end with that.</p>
<p>‘Due to my choice, Cairo has entered an irreversible path. Even if it was the right choice for the sake of the kingdom, history will hold me accountable for the reason for its defeat, and many people will die. We made the perfect reason for the empire to try to take over us and attack us again.’</p>
<p>Everyone’s evaluation was right. He was someone who didn’t fit in this turbulent world. His anxious appearance—trembling alone in an empty palace—was not the type of King the people would want.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to make excuses by saying he was young. Wasn’t Roman Dmitry fighting at the forefront even though he was just in his mid-20s?</p>
<p>He was just lacking. Cairo had a King worthy of a small nation, and even if it was the right decision, he wasn’t convinced that it was the right answer. He was anxious and nervous.</p>
<p>Having the position of King, he had to pay a huge price for each word he uttered. That’s why he tried to believe in people who could compensate for the things he lacked. It was at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p>
<p>From afar, the sound of running footsteps could be heard. Someone was running through the hallway and into the place where Daniel Cairo was.</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>The door opened. The moment he looked at Simon’s face as he entered,</p>
<p>‘Ahh, God.’</p>
<p>With a bright expression as if he had the whole world, Daniel Cairo tightly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a huge victory. From the other side of the screen, Count Vandenberg said with a face that couldn’t hold back his joy,</p>
<p>[Your Majesty the King! Cairo is victorious! There was a battle in the West and as a result, Count Fabio and the Kronos Empire were killed and the rest of their troops have been captured!]</p>
<p>In the Cairo kingdom, the hastily assembled important people cheered. They were all equally anxious, and the news from the West was like an oasis in a desert.</p>
<p>And Daniel Cairo asked,</p>
<p>“And the damage?”</p>
<p>They’ve passed the dangerous hurdle, however, the problem was not completely solved yet. The process of organizing their internal system remained, and troops were needed to prepare for the Kronos Empire’s response. In addition, the safety of Roman Dmitry was especially important.</p>
<p>[The allies’ damage is not much. It is all thanks to Roman Dmitry’s performance. The surprise attack on the enemies threw them into confusion, and because Roman Dmitry was able to handle Count Fabio, we were able to make them surrender. And in the process, we even dealt with the leader of the Knights of Kronos, Gustavo.]</p>
<p>It was truly an amazing achievement. When Daniel Cairo gave the order to attack, he had his own doubts about the situation. That was how scared he was about Cairo being defeated. Victory was not a result that Cairo was familiar with, and he thought it was fortunate to win against the strong forces of the empire.</p>
<p>However, they were able to become victorious with only minor damage. Daniel Cairo couldn’t hide his joy. He wanted to cheer like everyone else, but he couldn’t let go of his manners.</p>
<p>‘The war isn’t over yet. Diplomacy outside the battlefield is also a war. If I don’t finish the talks with the Kronos empire well, even if we had won the battle, it can lead to bad results..’</p>
<p>“I don’t know how the Kronos Empire will respond to this problem. First of all, the safety of the prisoners will be guaranteed as much as possible, and from now on, we will prepare for negotiations with Kronos. The primary goal is clear. Rather than driving the situation to the extreme and resulting in unnecessary turmoil, we must end this matter as peacefully as possible. The civil war hasn’t been cleared yet. Although the nobles faction led by Marquis Benedict has fallen, we need to bear in mind that their influence is still around, and the nobles of the empires also remain.”</p>
<p>[We will obey your orders.]</p>
<p>The screen was dyed in darkness. Daniel Cairo took a deep breath. He didn’t want to allow any carelessness, but a feeling of relief spread across his face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the western plains, a warm fire rose in a desolate place.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeik!</em></p>
<p>In the war, as Count Vandenberg said, there was only minor damage. But that was the norm for warfare, and that didn’t mean that only a few people died. Hundreds of people gave up their lives for the operation.</p>
<p>Occasionally, ruthless commanders would refuse to carry out funerals in such situations, but Roman Dmitry held his post and waited until the bodies burned.</p>
<p>He was familiar with death. He had witnessed so many deaths in his previous life, but he tried not to become accustomed to accepting death so easily.</p>
<p>The people risked their lives for him. Even though it was their choice, they knew very well that the moment they accepted their orders, sacrifices would happen, and he knew that if he took them for granted, their trust in him would falter. So Roman was also willing to sacrifice himself for them because he was the one who made them make sacrifices.</p>
<p>Looking at the burning flames, he showed courtesy and bowed.</p>
<p>“Clean up this place.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The funeral was over. Roman Dmitry, who left Chris to clean up, immediately returned to the fort to assess the condition of those who were injured.</p>
<p>The spacious place was full of wounded. People were groaning in pain, some were looking for a physician to heal them, and countless physicians were looking after the conditions of the other patients.</p>
<p>Before leaving for battle, Roman contacted Count Fabius and ordered the physicians to be sent to the West. Dmitry promised to take care of the expenses, and Count Fabius sent a large number of them. And they all devoted themselves to treating the wounded.</p>
<p>They didn’t just do a simple treatment. They also used expensive potions for those who needed them. And the other soldiers saw it. Knowing that the scene in front of them was because of Roman Dmitry, they were truly amazed.</p>
<p>“Amazing.”</p>
<p>“Using potions to treat normal soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Even though Dmitry has a lot of money, this is all thanks to Mr. Roman.”</p>
<p>Because of the war, the way everyone looked at Roman Dmitry changed. His overwhelming force aroused shock, and they all felt sincerely grateful that he took care of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Actually, even at first, they didn’t understand the blind loyalty his men had toward Dmitry. They thought they were foolish to jump into the fire for Roman Dmitry, but when they witnessed the treatment he gave the soldiers, they came to understand that there was a reason.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t neglect his people. They had never been treated like this before, so they felt a bit satisfied with this.</p>
<p>In addition, they were told that if they died or became disabled in the war, reasonable compensation would be given to their families.</p>
<p>Following Roman Dmitry wasn’t easy. As much as he had a reputation on the continent, they would always be destined to visit a dangerous place, but even so, he was an existence worth pledging loyalty to.</p>
<p>By the time the treatments were over, someone spoke to Roman.</p>
<p>“Can you give me a moment?”</p>
<p>It was one of the Western Front’s leaders, Baron Noel.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He was the brain on the Western Front. Rather than fighting directly on the battlefield, he would make plans or analyze the situation and lead them to an optimal solution. And it was not different this time. He suggested a stable option, although a bit naïve.</p>
<p>While living on the Western Front, he had been through numerous battles, and the pain he had suffered during all those times made him not want to choose Roman Dmitry’s method.</p>
<p>Baron Noel had doubts about the operation until the very end. Considering the difference in power between Kronos and Cairo, a battle outside the castle could not guarantee victory.</p>
<p>But it was a huge victory. Seeing the fort gates open and returning home in gold, Baron Noel finally faced reality.</p>
<p>‘I must have regressed.’</p>
<p>Flora Lawrence. She insisted on trusting Roman Dmitry until the very end.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that she had already established a relationship in the Northeast with him, she knew how to grasp the flow and accept it. The decision to open the gates, trust Roman Dmitry, and protect the entire force from the rear as much as possible—such an open mind eventually produced the most positive results.</p>
<p>His eyes were open now. It wasn’t the time for him to dwell on getting a position in the capital, but it was necessary for him to develop as someone suitable for the Western Front.</p>
<p>And to make sure of the commitment, Baron Noel approached Roman Dmitry. They went to a place where there were not many people, and he spoke sincere words.</p>
<p>“… I apologize for having a negative view of Roman Dmitry’s judgment. I couldn’t believe it. Born in a nation called Cairo, I wasn’t able to make the decisions that you did, and I felt like a member of a small nation. I thought that I had some experience on the Western Front, but it seems like I was narrow-minded. So I wanted to thank you and also apologize. Thanks to you, the Western Front and the Cairo Kingdom will be safe.”</p>
<p>Baron Noel was a good person. The world he experienced only forced him to make negative choices, but he was fit for the Western Front.</p>
<p>Cairo, a nation known as weak, was supported by figures such as Baron Noel. For whatever reason, they were all at the forefront, shedding blood, and because of their existence, Cairo remained alive despite foreign invasions.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“No. Blind trust on the battlefield is a deadly poison. Instead of blindly following my choices, opposing opinions are also necessary. Only then can we reach a more ideal conclusion. Baron Noel, you did your part well, and we managed to win the war in the end.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for saying that. Anyway, what do you plan on doing next? With Kronos’s prisoners secured, we have the upper hand at the negotiations.”</p>
<p>He changed the topic since there was more work to do. The war would only end once the negotiations with Kronos are concluded successfully, and all the leaders were hopeful about it.</p>
<p>But Roman thought differently.</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t as hopeful as you think.”</p>
<p>“… what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Given the past events, Roman Dmitry affirmed Kronos’s choice.</p>
<p>“Even though we have secured numerous prisoners, the empire will not negotiate.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 192 - New Map (2)</p>
<p>Every decision needs a reason. Before arriving at the conclusion that he had to pursue and defeat the Kronos Empire, Roman had to confirm it first.</p>
<p>‘Kronos is a nation that doesn’t stop any time. What kind of choice will they make if they, who had always invaded other borders first, get attacked? If this isn’t clearly confirmed, I might not be able to bear the cost of my decision.’</p>
<p>Based on the history of the continent, there were three examples that could confirm it.</p>
<p>The first was the conflict with the Kingdoms’ Alliance. The Kingdoms’ Alliance referred to the four southern nations around Kronos, and they were not safe from the threat of Kronos just like Cairo. So they formed a coalition to protect each other.</p>
<p>At the times that they were attacked by Kronos, Kronos would demand a formal apology for the reason that the knights of the Kingdoms’ Alliance, who were filled with resentment, brutally slaughtered their soldiers. The conditions were always absurd. They expressed their opinion that they would go to an all-out war if the knights in question didn’t kneel down and apologize.</p>
<p>The other two cases were the same. The Kronos Empire obviously made a mistake first, but in the process of covering up right and wrong, the victims were made to pay.</p>
<p>Similar incidents happened three times in the past. It can be interpreted that the decisions of the Kronos Empire were not accidents, and they had a way to turn things in their favor.</p>
<p>‘The Cairo Kingdom suffered in the same manner. In return, despite their demands for an apology and their repeated aggression every year, nothing was done to punish the enemies. Fighting between nations requires a cause, but having power is more important. The Kronos Empire doesn’t need a sensible reason, and if we take proper revenge, it will cause more problems for us.’</p>
<p>It wasn’t a common thought. Roman Dmitry knew how Kronos would act. It was the logic of the strong. It wasn’t like they didn’t know that they were in the wrong, but what mattered to them was that the weak showed hostility towards them.</p>
<p>Roman also knew that because he had lived the life of a strong man. Ruling through fear was possible if the weak crossed a clear line. Even if the people criticized them, the strong could rule over them.</p>
<p>It was a very slow process. The moment the strong ones controlled the minds of the weak, they could no longer make normal decisions, and no matter what the strong ones did, the weaker ones would just silently endure them.</p>
<p>There was no turning back. Roman Dmitry knew that his decision came with a cost, but he felt compelled to attack.</p>
<p>‘It is something I have to deal with someday. At the crossroads of choice, in order for the Cairo Kingdom to move in the right direction, taking risks is necessary even when the result is obvious.’</p>
<p>Looking at Baron Noel, Roman said,</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire has never made a decision resulting in the detriment of their nation, regardless of whose fault it is. It is the same this time. Even if they joined the rebellion and crossed the border first, what matters to them is the fact that a small kingdom like Cairo opened its gates and slaughtered their soldiers.”</p>
<p>“… then what are we supposed to do?”</p>
<p>Baron Noel was scared. He knew the war had just ended. However, due to an unexpected possibility, he could no longer enjoy the joy of victory.</p>
<p>“It is the same as before. From the moment we first chose to attack them, the one who takes a step back from this fight has no choice but to bear the full damage. Then our choice is simple.”</p>
<p>They had to stand up to the Kronos Empire one day if they didn’t want to be ruled by them, even if it meant their demise.</p>
<p>“From now on, we’ll have to fight another war at the negotiating table.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was as Roman had expected. Around the time the battlefield was almost settled, the Cairo royal family received a call from the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>[As His Majesty’s representative, I will reveal the position of the Kronos Empire.]</p>
<p>The voice was from someone in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was Baron Charlton. He had a stiff face as he stared at Daniel Cairo across the screen.</p>
<p>[The Kronos Empire participated in this war at the request of Marquis Benedict. The justification for participating in the war was given by Cairo, and we only agreed with their argument. We do not claim that our actions are right. However, when Marquis Benedict, the subject of the cause, was defeated, the troops of Kronos retreated and showed that we no longer had any plans of continuing the war. But what did Cairo do? It wasn’t enough that you opened your gates and chased after us, but you attacked us and brutally killed Count Fabio and Gustavo, the talents of the empire.]</p>
<p>“We were fighting a war. Is it wrong for us to punish our enemy?”</p>
<p>The opponent was a noble. However, given the fact that he was representing the Emperor, Daniel Cairo couldn’t treat his opponent disrespectfully.</p>
<p>In this negotiation, the leaders of the kingdom put their heads together for a favorable response. They intended on resolving the issue peacefully as much as possible, but the Kronos Empire’s claim shocked Cairo right from the start.</p>
<p>[Yes. It is wrong. Which is why we hope to be given the right compensation for it.]</p>
<p>“That isn’t possible. A war with Kronos was never our intention. We were attacked first, and we just opted to attack back. But you want us to pay you a fair price? If the Kronos Empire decides to act like this, we have no choice but to formally take this case to the ‘International Community.’ And Cairo was even thinking of releasing the prisoners first as a gesture of peace, but if the Kronos Empire continues to be hostile, we are left with no other options.”</p>
<p>He came out strong. Representing the Cairo Kingdom’s voice, he didn’t want to back down this time.</p>
<p>[Do whatever you want. Raising a problem with the International Community will not provide a reason for Cairo to go to war. And Kronos will not accept any bargain for the lives of the captives. Now, we will give you two options. There are no other negotiations.]</p>
<p>It was a one-sided conversation. The other side went silent, and the empire’s thoughts were displayed.</p>
<p>[We request Roman Dmitry’s punishment for brutally murdering Count Fabio. In return, we want one of his arms. If Roman Dmitry comes to the empire, offers his arm, and kneels down to apologize, and if you release all of Kronos’s prisoners, the Kronos Empire will not make this incident an issue anymore. That is your first option. If you reject that, the second option would be an all-out war against Kronos. Negotiations will not be allowed for the first ten days of the war. Make your decision now. If not, Kronos will declare war against the Cairo Kingdom.]</p>
<p>That was the end. Baron Charlton cut off the communication without even listening to his answer.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the Cairo Royal Palace, everyone was shocked after the meeting. They were at a loss for words in response to what they had heard, and they were afraid to figure out how to accept this situation.</p>
<p>They were forced. The Kronos Empire forced them to make a choice even after knowing they were in the wrong.</p>
<p>Simon said,</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Highness. The Kronos Empire is not making this offer to receive an apology right now. Given Roman Dmitry’s ability in the war, it is clear that they intend to eliminate any potential threats against them in advance.”</p>
<p>They were sure of it. Roman Dmitry was an existence beyond the fence of the kingdom. Cairo, which had always been meek and displayed an attitude befitting a small country, took a different step than before with Roman Dmitry in the front.</p>
<p>Other than killing Gustavo, if the testimony from the battlefield reached the Kronos Empire, they would have been wary of the force Roman Dmitry had.</p>
<p>He was just in his mid-20s, yet Roman Dmitry was able to kill Gustavo. He didn’t just win. It was an overwhelming victory, and no one can really fathom how powerful Roman truly was.</p>
<p>An apology was just an excuse in this situation. Daniel Cairo gritted his teeth at the blatant attitude of Kronos.</p>
<p>‘We are suffering this humiliation because we are a weak nation.’</p>
<p>His own father, the former King, wanted peace. As he grew up watching that kind of person, Daniel Cairo inherited his father’s benevolence, but when he faced the cruel reality, he realized how irresponsible his father was. As the King, he shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p>If he faced a brutal situation against a predator like the Kronos Empire, he needed to have a strong national power to survive. The problem was that it was too late. Reality struck, and now the Kronos Empire is forcing them to make an unavoidable choice.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Daniel Cairo. In a situation where no one could give any advice except for Simon, Daniel Cairo said with a firm expression,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is the Hero of Cairo. He did things for Cairo, and that fact is known to all the people in Cairo, including those present here. But what would happen if we abandoned such an existence just so we could live? We might be safe now, but that is all. The Kronos Empire will use this incident as a chance to cut down on our ways to live, and no one else will be willing to sacrifice their life for us. Because when the pillar called Roman Dmitry falls, Cairo is bound to collapse.”</p>
<p>It was a risky choice. Kronos wasn’t the type of nation that said empty words, and they wouldn’t let go of their decision to go to war.</p>
<p>But in the future, in the new Cairo, there would be no fights within the nation, nor would there be any neglect of talented people dedicated to the nation.</p>
<p>Even if the result was their ruin, it was Daniel Cairo’s responsibility. At least as the King of the Kingdom and as the person who allowed the decision to attack the Kronos Empire, Daniel Cairo didn’t avoid the responsibility.</p>
<p>“Summon Roman Dmitry right now. I will discuss this matter with him directly.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Two days later, Roman Dmitry arrived at the palace. Daniel Cairo couldn’t even greet him properly.</p>
<p>“… that is how things turned out. What should I do?”</p>
<p>He asked him honestly about Kronos’s offer. In the situation where his brain couldn’t give him the right answer, he needed someone to say something to him.</p>
<p>And Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“From now on, it is time for a new game. The Kronos Empire is aware of the fact that their proposal is out of touch with common sense. Nevertheless, their reason for forcing such a ridiculous choice is to deal with my existence and set the status of their empire right. If you accept their proposal, the future in which Cairo becomes under the control of the Kronos Empire is unavoidable.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do either. However, we can’t just ignore the ones with power and move on. Just like what you said, if Kronos wants to set the status of the empire right, they will want us to fulfill one of the options they have given.”</p>
<p>The first option couldn’t be considered, so they were left with the second option—an all-out war with Kronos. Even assuming that Roman Dmitry was the best on the continent, there was no way they could defeat the empire with the power of Cairo alone.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. From the moment he made the decision to attack first, he already knew the answer.</p>
<p>“There is a way to avoid war while taking advantage of me. Please send an envoy to the Kronos Empire. I will directly go to the empire and solve the problem.”</p>
<p>“I cannot allow that. The Kronos Empire wants to punish you now. And if you go there on your own, in the worst case, you could lose your life.”</p>
<p>Roman’s suggestion was too bold. As he said, the problem could be solved, but it was impossible for them to let Roman Dmitry go. It was an irresponsible decision that he didn’t want to make.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the decision should be shared, but Roman’s proposal was no different from making him take full responsibility.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that one of the people in the palace who was listening to their conversation stepped forward and said,</p>
<p>“Can I say something?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry knows how to solve the problem. And Your Majesty considers it a risky choice for Roman Dmitry to visit the Kronos Empire. Wouldn’t it be enough for someone else from Cairo to be the envoy to Kronos? If there is such a person who can perfectly implement your plan, I think it will be an optimal agreement.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry intended to execute the plan himself. Just as Daniel Cairo took responsibility for the decision, Roman also had a different opinion.</p>
<p>But after confirming the voice of the owner, Roman knew that his words had power, and Daniel Cairo did as well. He nodded his head to show his agreement.</p>
<p>“Count Fabius. Does that mean you will go as the envoy to the Kronos Empire?”</p>
<p>“You are right. I will represent Cairo and convey our intentions to that heinous Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p>The Raccoon of Cairo—he opened up a new path.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 193 - New Map (3)</p>
<p>Fabius was like a bat. The kind of life he has lived until now has earned him the nickname the Raccoon of Cairo, and during the clash between Roman Dmitry and Marquis Benedict, he betrayed the nobles.</p>
<p>Some people criticized him for it. No matter how much he went after his own gains, seeing him betray the nobles’ faction, whom he had been with for a long time, he was more devoted to himself and his own growth. And that wasn’t wrong. Fabius wasn’t someone you could put your trust in, but that didn’t mean his abilities were lacking.</p>
<p>So Daniel Cairo thought that maybe Fabius might be the right person.</p>
<p>‘Fabius is one of the best people in Cairo when it comes to his political skills. He knows how to read the trend and make fast and bold choices. Even though he was a key figure in Marquis Benedict’s faction, his ability is clear, and his decision to stay by Roman Dmitry’s side proves he can be trusted.’</p>
<p>The problem was that they needed someone who excelled in diplomacy. In order to perfectly carry out Roman Dmitry’s plan, it was necessary for that person to have the courage to speak without trembling, even when entering the jaws of a beast.</p>
<p>And Fabius met that condition. Aside from simply being capable, Fabius was now looking for a chance to prove his skills.</p>
<p>In the new future, this would be the new trend. Count Fabius openly showed his intention to jump on the bandwagon for a bright future.</p>
<p>‘It isn’t a bad choice since his intention is clear. If each side achieves the goals they want, then the result is a lot better.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“The negotiation with Kronos isn’t a matter to be taken lightly. They are similar to magic bombs in a way that we do not know when they will be directed at us, and there is a possibility that they might break the Continental Law of not touching the envoy. We will reject the options they have given, and you will steer them in our direction. Your life could end the moment you utter a statement of refusal, so will you still take such a risk and leave for Kronos as the envoy?”</p>
<p>“I am ready to give up my life for Cairo. I will do my best to carry out the mission perfectly.”</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate to answer. And so the final decision fell on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo looked at Roman Dmitry and asked him,</p>
<p>“I think Count Fabius is the right person for this job. What do you think, Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The meeting was over. Roman Dmitry, who was given a day to decide, walked with Count Fabius.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>And then he stopped walking. In a place far away from people, Roman Dmitry looked at Fabius.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>A Count and an heir to a noble family—even though the difference in their status was clear, both Roman Dmitry, who treated him normally, and Count Fabius, who listened to him, accepted the situation naturally. Ever since Count Fabius took the lead in punishing the nobles, regardless of their status, they naturally acted like a Lord and a subordinate.</p>
<p>The plan was laid out. Count Fabius lowered his head and said,</p>
<p>“In the last battle, I had the honor of standing as the vanguard for Roman Dmitry. It may be that I am being greedy, but I don’t want our relationship to have an abrupt end. This Fabius wants to live for Roman Dmitry. Please consider my act as an envoy to be an expression of my loyalty to Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>There was a rope in front of his eyes, and Count Fabius grabbed it tightly. Knowing all too well the negative prejudice against him, his loyalty was a little different from other people’s.</p>
<p>“I will not deny that I am a defector. No matter how much I prove my abilities and pledge allegiance, the basics will not change that. People say a person who has defected once is likely to do so again. I cannot predict the future either. Unlike the rest of Roman Dmitry’s followers, I cannot ask you to trust me blindly either, but I will take this chance to show you.”</p>
<p>He looked at Roman, and with determined eyes, he put strength into his voice.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be treated the same way as the people that Mr. Roman Dmitry trusts. However, please use the man named Count Fabius in the future. Anything is fine. I am fine with being used as an envoy this time, and if you order it, I will even hug straws of rice and jump into a pit of fire. I will prove that I am not just a being who follows orders but a useful being who executes them properly. Promise me just one thing in return. Please be my support for wealth and honor, and as long as I get to live by your side, I am ready to do anything.”</p>
<p>Fabius’s proposal was straightforward. Rather than the normal relationship between a Lord and a subordinate, he wanted an exchange. If Roman Dmitry remains in power unless he falls down like Marquis Benedict, Fabius said he would be useful to Dmitry until the end.</p>
<p>‘Count Fabius’s decision is not accidental. He experienced war with me, and in the process, he learned what kind of person I am. He found out that instead of a one-sided feeling towards me, he wanted a relationship with benefits.’</p>
<p>It was ideal and fun. On the fierce battlefield, while Roman Dmitry swung his sword at the enemies, Count Fabius looked at Roman alone—how he behaved, what values he had, and what standards his relationships with those who followed him were formed by.</p>
<p>There were various characters, and they had different reasons for their allegiance. Chris hoped for power beyond Roman Dmitry, Kevin expressed his blind loyalty to the savior of his life, and Henderson longed for Roman Dmitry, who defeated the Blood Fang.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just an emotional exchange. Even Volkan and Pooky, both former mercenaries, were satisfied with the benefits they received from Roman Dmitry, and everyone had their own reasons to follow him.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. Roman Dmitry was at the center of everyone. Count Fabius knew right then how important it was to build a relationship with Roman and how to maintain a relationship that benefited him.</p>
<p>If….. If Roman Dmitry was similar to Benedict, Fabius would have put on a fake face and cried out his loyalty, but Roman was not Benedict. He honestly emphasized a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>“Please accept me.”</p>
<p>He was on his knees. He bowed his head and let go of his pride. The more he looked at him, the more he liked him. The appearance of having a solid foundation to lead someone—this was the answer he had been searching for.</p>
<p>“Count Fabius.”</p>
<p>He raised his head. Seeing him look up, Roman Dmitry showed an unwavering gaze.</p>
<p>“From now on, you are one of my people, and you will enjoy everything you want.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, after completing all the preparations, Count Fabius joined the delegation and headed for the Kronos Empire. They were running out of time. There was a time limit of ten days, so it was a bit of a forced march, but the delegation had no choice but to hurry.</p>
<p>While moving, a member of the delegation and a noble who followed the King asked,</p>
<p>“Count Fabius. How on earth can you survive betraying someone you love? I honestly don’t understand. Even if you sometimes fail, you have to succeed dozens of times to be recognized, and Roman Dmitry isn’t the type to tolerate failure. Most of all, didn’t you survive by moving to another powerful side this time too?”</p>
<p>It was an honest question, to which Fabius answered with a smile,</p>
<p>“There is something that people misunderstand. There is romance in betrayal.”</p>
<p>“Romance?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The so-called renegades tend to stick around without a solid spine and only seek gain. Such beings have no right to swear allegiance. Those in power already have people who have devoted themselves to them, but how can they survive if there are no such people among them?”</p>
<p>Driving his horse and looking through the plains, he thought of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“That is why I always give my heart. Despite knowing that a man named Fabius was a traitor, he asked me to prove my worth so he wouldn’t abandon me. It is a simple thing. There are people willing to risk their lives. If a person dares to make a decision that even the most loyal people would hesitate to make, but that person has a past of being a traitor, would the part about him being a traitor be the only thing you decide to listen to? For that one reason alone?”</p>
<p>“….no, I will probably keep him by my side and use him.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You will use him. That one chance is how a traitor becomes a follower.”</p>
<p>Actually, their relationship wasn’t completely sincere. It was true that he was sincerely carrying out the orders, but that was what the other person wanted.</p>
<p>However, Roman was different. For the first time, he didn’t put on a mask and speak of loyalty, and Fabius mustered up the courage to speak about a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>‘I also don’t like this life of betrayal. If Marquis Benedict had stayed in power for the rest of his life, I would have stuck with him. The reason I live a life of betrayal is that there has been no one to whom I wanted to give my loyalty to. And Roman Dmitry is someone who is different from the others I had experienced with.’</p>
<p>It could be a hasty thought, but Count Fabius thought that he might have found someone to serve for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Capital of the Empire.</p>
<p>They had arrived in Alexander. Count Fabius, who was visiting the Empire for the first time, was shocked as he looked at the castle’s gate.</p>
<p>‘… is this an empire?’</p>
<p>There was a huge castle, and the scenery inside was shocking. The magnificent buildings, which couldn’t be seen in Cairo, and the strong-looking guards on the other side of the roads gave him goosebumps.</p>
<p>He scanned the surroundings with sharp eyes, and this proved just how powerful the empire was. It was so different from Cairo. Daniel Cairo was swayed by the nobles, but Kronos was a nation that respected the Emperor like a God.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>They passed through the gate, escorted by a knight. The pattern on his forearm proved that he was a member of the 7th Knight Troops, and yet the force this man held was unique. Every time their eyes met, it felt so intense that he gasped for breath.</p>
<p>Even if Count Fabius wasn’t a great swordsman, he could at least guess whether or not the other person was a strong being. He was sure of it—the Imperial Knights were stronger than Count Nicholas. He couldn’t be certain if the existence called Cairo’s First Sword could rival this man.</p>
<p>‘I have now entered an extraordinary world.’</p>
<p>His mouth felt dry. He hadn’t even met the Twelve Swords of the Continent yet. If he had been tasked to be his guide, then he was surely just a gatekeeper, but that alone completely overwhelmed Count Fabius.</p>
<p>And the reason why the envoy of Cairo was now in Kronos popped into his mind. Roman Dmitry took Gustavo’s life, the leader of the 10th unit of the Knights of Kronos, but such a result didn’t even seem to bother Kronos.</p>
<p>He took a step. As he entered the palace, which was the pinnacle of splendor, he passed through endless corridors before stopping in front of a huge door.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the Emperor, the envoy has arrived.”</p>
<p>The door didn’t open right away. It was the Emperor’s place. Even though the knight was simply looking at the door as he spoke, he bowed his head to the door and showed respect.</p>
<p>Even though Count Fabius was loyal to a different nation, he bowed to the huge door and didn’t dare look up until the Emperor’s voice could be heard from the other side.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>Count Fabius, who finally entered the room, trembled at the presence in front of him. It was the Emperor of the Empire. The sight of him looking down from the highest point made Count Fabius gulp.</p>
<p>‘… the moment I slip my words, I will die right here.’</p>
<p>His instincts warned him.</p>
<p>A giant who shouldn’t be touched—that was what Count Fabius thought of the Emperor of Kronos, whom he was meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 194 - New Map (4)</p>
<p>Is this what it feels like to be suffocated by intimidation? The Emperor of Kronos looked at Count Fabius in silence. He was huge enough to fill the throne and had a cold expression on his face.</p>
<p>Even if he cast off the guise of being the Emperor of Kronos, he would still be a 5-star aura swordsman. Although not officially registered in the Rankings, the presence that the Emperor had was enough to make the entire palace a mess.</p>
<p>Fabius walked slowly. He didn’t rush his steps until he reached the emperor, but he also didn’t dare to look up either.</p>
<p>The moment the door opened, the scene that came into view was too shocking. The key figures of Kronos were all lined up on both sides of the Emperor, and it showed how huge the mountain that Kronos was if one wanted to climb it.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He stopped walking. He bowed on behalf of the delegation, and then the Emperor asked,</p>
<p>“Are you Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“No. I am Count Fabius of Cai…”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>It happened in an instant. The moment Count Fabius revealed his identity, the Emperor of Kronos distorted his expression, and at the same time, the knight who guided Fabius grabbed him by the neck and made him fall to the ground.</p>
<p>He suppressed Fabius’s head by force, making it impossible for him to lift his head. And from above, he heard the voice of the Emperor.</p>
<p>“My representative made it clear. Negotiations are not possible, and if you do not want an all-out war with Kronos, Roman Dmitry should come and offer up his arm.”</p>
<p>“T-That…”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He couldn’t get a word out. The knight was pushing Count Fabius’s head with such great force that his words couldn’t help but die down. His heart was beating against the ground. He knew that the Emperor of Kronos was a man who loved war, but he didn’t think that an envoy would be treated like this.</p>
<p>“I understand the meaning of Cairo well. If you want an all-out war, I will show you the will of Kronos by cutting off your arm as the envoy.”</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>His heart fell, and his blood went cold.</p>
<p>‘If I don’t say anything now, Cairo cannot avoid an all-out war. I cannot even beg for anything here. My plan to be in the good graces of Roman Dmitry will be messed up, and his plan will fail. The problem is that if I become too aggressive, the Emperor might make a harsh decision, and our entire nation will be in trouble. I need to convey my words and the intention of Cairo without being too rude but not being too servile either.’</p>
<p>He shook his head. For a single decision, each word meant a lot. In a situation where his life could be in danger, Count Fabius felt like his senses sharpened.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the Emperor of Kronos! Cairo does not want an all-out war! Please give me a chance to speak. After I convey the will of Cairo, you may take my head and not just my arm!”</p>
<p>He risked his life. He shook off the hand that was pushing him down and raised his voice. But no answer came back. It felt like an eternity of silence passed where only his heart that was thumping so loud could be heard, and soon the Emperor of Kronos said,</p>
<p>“Remember what you just said. If Cairo cannot convince me, you will die on the spot.”</p>
<p>The knight stepped aside.</p>
<p>Fabius got his chance to speak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He got up. With a red face, he caught his breath and looked up at the Emperor of Kronos, his clothes all tangled.</p>
<p>He was afraid. His heart raced, but Count Fabius didn’t let fear get the best of him.</p>
<p>“Our reason for rejecting the offer that the Kronos Empire made is that Marquis Benedict’s rebellion didn’t have a justification in the first place. Marquis Benedict rebelled because his own safety was in danger, and his involvement with the Kronos Empire was not the right decision to make. We do not want an all-out war with Kronos, and we have decided that it isn’t worth sacrificing the talent of the kingdom for it.”</p>
<p>Kronos mentioned their justification the other day. Since the empire was drawn in by Cairo’s nobles, their attack was justified.</p>
<p>First of all, the most important thing was for them to deny that. His words just now were made under the assumption that the Kronos Empire didn’t break the Continental Laws.</p>
<p>“Cairo asked for the opinion of the International Community on this matter. There was a war between the nations for an unjust reason, and it was necessary for us to check if one side had the obligation to be made responsible for it. And the five kingdoms, apart from Valhalla, expressed their willingness to agree with Cairo. Your Majesty, the Emperor of Kronos. There was no reason for another nation to intervene in a war that started with a civil war. However, if you wish for Cairo to make a sacrifice, we have no choice but to be driven into a corner.”</p>
<p>It was a strange way of talking. By first saying that they had the consent of other kingdoms, it was like saying Cairo was being supported.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Roman Dmitry contacted the five kingdoms on the continent for the negotiations with the Kronos Empire to go smoothly. The conversation with them wasn’t so difficult.</p>
<p>The Kingdoms’ Alliance in the southern part of Kronos wanted a friendly relationship with Cairo because of their dispute with Kronos. At the same time, the Hector Kingdom decided that it was necessary to let go of their past bad relationship and unite their voices this time.</p>
<p>It was an incident in which the empire oppressed a kingdom for no reason. The empire is attacking Cairo now, but after that, which kingdom would they go after? That was Roman’s plan—to gather the power of the kingdoms.</p>
<p>Each kingdom had a struggling military power, but the story would be different if the six kingdoms chose to side with each other.</p>
<p>And Count Fabius said,</p>
<p>“Cairo wants peace. If the Kronos Empire wants war, show your will by cutting off my head. However, if you agree with Cairo, I hope this ends well.”</p>
<p>His speech was over. All their cards were placed on the table, and now it was Kronos’s turn to decide.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cairo’s intention was too clear. Gambling from the edge of a cliff, if they were pushed, they were saying that all the kingdoms would come together.</p>
<p>And there was something else in those words. The reason why the Valhalla Empire wasn’t included in the plan was that they were the evil partner of Kronos.</p>
<p>They were the two high mountains on the same continent. If the name of the Valhalla Empire had been uttered with threatening remarks, the Emperor of Kronos might have made an extreme choice even for the sake of the empire’s status. So the Valhalla Empire was excluded.</p>
<p>They said Valhalla had nothing to do with this incident, but that didn’t mean their existence was completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>‘If a war breaks out between Kronos and the Kingdoms’ Alliance, the Kronos Empire will surely win, but what happens after the war is over is the problem. The Kronos Empire, which had exerted a lot of energy to defeat the six kingdoms, would have to be very cautious about a war with Valhalla. We didn’t mention Valhalla, but they would have no choice but to be wary of them. This is the best option we can choose.’</p>
<p>It was a kind of intimidation. Touching the pride of the Emperor was said to be the best way to compromise. And by attracting other nations, they made it difficult for Kronos to touch them.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a great person. Fabius thought that strength could only be found in military power, but the plan that Roman Dmitry thought of was perfect. In the current situation, there was no better plan than this. The Kronos Empire was not ready to conquer the continent yet, and they did not want to hasten it.</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p>Count Fabius gulped. He trusted Roman Dmitry’s plan, but the presence of the Emperor of Kronos made his throat dry. It was then…</p>
<p>“You seem to have used your head quite a bit.”</p>
<p>He didn’t panic. It wasn’t even an angry voice. As if he had expected it, the Emperor turned to Count Fabius with an expressionless face. From the start until now, the Emperor of Kronos has not changed his expression much. So even if he was the Raccoon of Cairo, he couldn’t guess what his real emotions were.</p>
<p>“In exchange for freeing the captives of Kronos, I will end the problem here. But the treatment of Roman Dmitry is a separate issue.”</p>
<p>“… what is that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry killed my people. Count Fabio, Gustavo, and the Knights of Kronos. They were all devoted to the empire, and as the Emperor, I want to be compensated in blood. Every night from now on, my people will visit Roman Dmitry. The crime of killing talented people from the empire—it is up to Roman Dmitry and the Cairo Kingdom to handle this issue.”</p>
<p>The Emperor of Kronos was a scary person. Cairo brought other nations into this issue, yet his desire for the blood of Roman Dmitry didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Assassination. How can he help him now? No matter how unfair this situation felt, he knew that there was a high chance that the death of Roman Dmitry would end in an assassination.</p>
<p>He felt goosebumps rise for a moment. The Emperor never wanted an all-out war with Cairo in the first place. It occurred to him that he had set up a plan to restore the status of his empire by driving Cairo into a corner and rescuing his men, along with assassinating Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Above the sky, his existence was above the heavens. The empire was called an empire for a reason.</p>
<p>“And from now on, the same things will not work.”</p>
<p>The Emperor said that, and Count Fabius felt lost.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, Fabius returned to Cairo. He went to the King and reported all the things that had happened and bowed to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… I apologize. A variable had popped up.”</p>
<p>The war was avoided. However, as someone who served Roman Dmitry, he couldn’t bring himself to talk about the assassination attempts that would happen in the future.</p>
<p>His face was red. As a traitor, he showed confidence when he left to prove himself, but in front of the giant, the Emperor, Fabius couldn’t find an answer. However…</p>
<p>“Well done.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t seem interested. He had already accepted the things that Count Fabius couldn’t say.</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire never gave up on their decision. Their target had been me from the start, and it is very likely that they wouldn’t step back without a threat. You did your best for what I asked for.”</p>
<p>He had actually expected Kronos’s response.</p>
<p>‘Emperor Kronos. As expected, he is a belligerent person.’</p>
<p>If Roman Dmitry had gone as the envoy, even if he had spoken of assassination, he wouldn’t have killed him. It was more of a matter of pride than profit for the Emperor.</p>
<p>If he had allowed Roman Dmitry to live and killed him outside of the empire, the people would be intimidated by the influence of the empire. So Roman volunteered to go. Knowing that the Kronos Empire was similar to him, he knew that it wasn’t dangerous. Even if the worst scenario happened, Roman Dmitry had a way out.</p>
<p>“… are you sure you are fine? The Kronos Empire has spoken of assassination, and a swordsman of Valhalla who was once their target died.”</p>
<p>Count Fabius was concerned. It was to be expected. He trusted Roman Dmitry, but the name Kronos had its own weight.</p>
<p>But he didn’t know the truth. Roman Dmitry—no, Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, what kind of life did he live? Assassinations were a daily occurrence for him. Emperor Kronos’s intention to scare him was misguided right from the start.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. That is my problem now.”</p>
<p>His blood boiled.</p>
<p>Finally, it felt like he was walking on knives after entering this world.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 195 - New Map (5)</p>
<p>It was a messy time. At the time when the Cairo Kingdom was changing rapidly, Count Gregory, who followed the Kronos Empire, was in prison.</p>
<p>At first, he kept being stubborn as he was being dragged by the soldiers. He yelled loudly, asking if the Kronos Empire would stay still when they would find out that he was being touched, but the situation was becoming worse as the days progressed.</p>
<p>“… is that true?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is a mess outside. It is said that Roman Dmitry led the troops to the Benedict estate and eradicated the rebels. The Kronos Empire joined with the nobles to attack the Western Front, but the nobles fell so quickly that the Kronos Empire couldn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>“This.”</p>
<p>Inside the jail, one of Gregory’s men gave him the information. His heart sank with each piece of news. As Marquis Benedict’s long-time rival, he knew how well-prepared the man was for this kind of situation.</p>
<p>In addition, his castle was impregnable. Yet such a fortress was destroyed in just a few days, which meant that his own life was at stake. His last hope was the Kronos Empire. If they could take over the Western Front, there was a chance that they could compromise with the Cairo royal family. But…</p>
<p>“…the news just came in. I do not believe it either, but it didn’t just end with the Western Front defeating the Kronos Empire. They opened the gates and followed them out, killing Count Fabio, the commander, and Gustavo, the leader of the 10th unit of the Knights of Kronos. What should we do? Roman Dmitry has dealt with all the dangers of the kingdom.”</p>
<p>At that moment, his head spun. Count Gregory sat down and thought of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘That monster.’</p>
<p>He knew that guy was odd. He had such a strong presence that even a small well called Cairo was overflowing. Even when he thought that he overestimated the guy, the truth was that he underestimated him.</p>
<p>If the Kronos Empire stepped back, the nobles of the empires and the rebels would not be able to live in this land. And Count Gregory began to get anxious at that point. In a situation where death could fall on him at any time, he couldn’t just sit in prison doing nothing.</p>
<p>And it was finally the day the prison doors opened. During the time he was summoned by the King, a guard told him,</p>
<p>“Count Gregory, the Kronos Empire didn’t admit their wrongdoings and asked for Roman Dmitry’s arm for the crime of killing Count Fabio and Knight Gustavo.”</p>
<p>At those words, he smiled. There wasn’t any mention of him dying. And if Kronos wasn’t stepping back, then he might live.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Gregory was brought before the King. As he knelt on the ground, he looked at Daniel Cairo with a calm face.</p>
<p>“Count Gregory, you colluded with the Kronos Empire and disturbed the peace of the nation. Do you admit this fact?”</p>
<p>It was the expected question. The moment he admits it, he will lose the power in his hands, and he might lose his head. But…</p>
<p>“I admit it.”</p>
<p>He didn’t step back. Looking straight into the eyes of the King, he said,</p>
<p>“It is an open fact that everyone knows that I follow the Kronos Empire. But is it wrong? Marquis Benedict, who rebelled, had paid for it, but not me. I had nothing to do with it, so why am I being treated like this?”</p>
<p>“So shameless. The fact that you admitted it is a sufficient reason to treat you as a traitor.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you are mistaken. Since Marquis Benedict is from Cairo, it would not be a problem to punish him for treason, but I am someone who has sworn my allegiance to the Kronos Empire. Even if I am a noble in Cairo, I am not in the same position as Marquis Benedict. If you kill me here, will the Kronos Empire stand still? They are hunters. They are even angry that their knight was killed on the battlefield, so how do you think they will respond to my death?”</p>
<p>His attitude changed. There was no way he could live silently. If he had the Kronos Empire behind him, he would make use of it.</p>
<p>“His Majesty, Emperor Kronos, seeks bloody vengeance. If you kill me, you will have to pay a price, so why don’t you just send me to the empire? If you don’t want blood on your hands, then get rid of the dangers in Cairo. We can do that for each other.”</p>
<p>He kept his head up and looked at the King with wide eyes. Even though he was kneeling for his sins, through his eyes, he was showing that he was still higher than Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>The threat worked. At those words, the King’s expression crumbled.</p>
<p>‘… he isn’t completely wrong.’</p>
<p>Fabius returned, and he learned of the pride that the empire had. Daniel Cairo was worried about Roman, but there was nothing he could do about it. In addition, there was no one else other than the Royal Knights who could protect the kingdom. The opponent was the Kronos Empire, a horrible monster that was much stronger than Count Nicholas.</p>
<p>And so guilt took over him. He was sure that it was the right choice for the kingdom, but he felt it was unfair for Roman to pay the price. From start to finish, Roman did everything for him. If he hadn’t defeated the nobles and the Kronos Empire, then Cairo would have been destroyed, but he couldn’t just let Roman pay for the price alone. There was no solution.</p>
<p>Count Gregory touched the King’s soft spot. The empire’s faction—he wanted to kill all of them. However, thinking that their anger toward Roman might grow, he didn’t want to say anything. He was certainly a King, but he was a weak one.</p>
<p>In the situation where he had to make a decision, he felt confused. At that moment, he turned to Roman Dmitry, and their eyes met.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was silent. Roman Dmitry stepped forward and asked,</p>
<p>“Can I say something?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Emperor Kronos is not the type of person who takes back what he says. If he said he would make me pay with blood, then it means that he would send people to assassinate me. But it has already happened. Aside from the problems you have to deal with from now on, what is there to be afraid of when I was just warned about being killed? Count Fabio and Knight Gustavo—they are people with good names and worth that Count Gregory cannot be compared to. If so, make a decision and lighten the burden on Cairo.”</p>
<p>Gregory was shocked. And cutting him off before he says anything, Roman Dmitry raises his voice,</p>
<p>“From the moment the ones committing treason were killed, the peace of Cairo has passed. Your Majesty, your choice paves the path we will move towards. Even if Your Majesty’s people die because of it, it will be the right decision to make, and no one will resent that choice. There is no war in which no one dies. If you weigh the lives of your people and let go of something important, then the situation becomes irreversible.”</p>
<p>The leaders present at the Cairo Royal Palace were at a loss for words. Why? Why was Roman Dmitry so fearless? Even though the Kronos Empire spoke of his assassination so openly, there was no fear in Roman Dmitry’s voice.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo gulped. The weak King was always shaken, but he tried to face reality until the end.</p>
<p>“Cairo owes a great deal of debt to the Dmitry family. Even if this choice makes you the target of assassination, the royal family will not forget Dmitry’s devotion.”</p>
<p>Then he shifted his gaze to Count Gregory. Looking at his puzzled face, he said,</p>
<p>“Count Gregory. Your collusion with the Kronos Empire wasn’t enough. You even dared to reveal the facts in front of us, thus tarnishing Cairo’s honor. Cairo’s chaos has stemmed from neglecting such things. Marquis Benedict, Count Gregory, and Count Denver. From the moment you people only cared about your own interests regardless of the safety of the nation, Cairo fell into absolute chaos.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! There is some misunderstanding…”</p>
<p>“Shut up!”</p>
<p>His face was red. Daniel Cairo was no longer a young King. Due to the ongoing fights and after meeting Roman Dmitry, something changed in his heart. He made a decision as King.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo’s eyes were cold.</p>
<p>“Count Gregory, the traitor, will be sentenced to death for endangering the nation.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Life was both easy and difficult. Cairo suffered for a long time due to the messy power system, but with Daniel Cairo’s decision, things started to change, and two people would climb the guillotine. At the end of Count Gregory and Count Denver, those who followed them didn’t dare protest.</p>
<p>People flocked to the square in Cairos. But before heading there, Count Denver looked at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… I was a fool. If I had recognized you as a threat to the empire right from the start, I would have dealt with you before this happened. If it weren’t for you, Cairo would have been torn to pieces and walked down to its chaos.”</p>
<p>Count Gregory was silent. Unlike him, who only looked at the ground in pain, Count Denver hasn’t given up yet.</p>
<p>“Even now, you can swear your allegiance to the empire. Right now, you must be under the illusion of being great, but you are nothing compared to the empire. Knight Gustavo? In Cairo, he is higher than Count Nicholas, but by the standards of the continent, he is just at the 78th. There are so many stronger people in the empire, and you cannot surpass them. Do you think you can handle those monsters?! Are you sure you can stop them if they try to kill your family?”</p>
<p>His voice gained strength. The King had already given the verdict, but he was sure that if Roman changed his mind, he could live.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. You are not stupid. One choice in life determines everything. If you remain a man of Cairo, all your future choices will turn into hardships. But the empire can put wings on your back. Think wisely. Even if you had crossed the river, which you shouldn’t have with Kronos, Valhalla would give you a chance. And if my head is cut off, your chances are over.”</p>
<p>It was his last chance, but no reply came back. Count Denver gritted his teeth in anger as he said,</p>
<p>“The day will surely come when you will regret the choice you made today. The Valhalla Empire will make you pay the price for my life. With one choice, you are turning both mountains into your enemies.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He stopped walking. This scene was something Roman was used to. The words spoken by losers were always the same, and when they struggled and failed, a loss of hope could be seen in their eyes. Just like Count Gregory, who had given up on everything.</p>
<p>As he looked at Count Denver, who still believed he was right, Roman Dmitry smiled.</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>
<p>Right, that was it. Those should be the last words a loser should hear, and Count Denver was dragged away with trembling eyes. And then…</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>He died in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 196 - Dmitry Duchy (1)</p>
<p>Among the four factions within Cairo, three of them had walked the path of downfall. Those who participated in the rebellion, such as Marquis Benedict, suffered a bloody purge without anyone being exempted, and the future of those who followed Count Gregory and Denver depended on the severity of their mistakes.</p>
<p>Of course, those who actively acted as puppets didn’t get the same fate as the rebels, but those who stayed on the right side were able to save their lives.</p>
<p>The civil war turned the nation into a mess. The number of those who had to be punished just for joining a faction was too great, so they had to decide who could be forgiven and who couldn’t. It was a decision that everyone agreed on.</p>
<p>In their hearts, they wanted them to pay the price, but if they did that, Cairo’s power would weaken. So instead, Daniel Cairo, who finished the issue by freeing the captives of Kronos, prepared a grand ceremony for those who believed in him until the end.</p>
<p>The people gathered in front of the Cairo Royal Palace, and in front of them, the names of the heroes who saved the nation were spoken out loud and given awards.</p>
<p>“Count Vandenberg, the commander of the Western Front, confidently defeated the enemies despite the attack of Kronos and raised the status of Cairo. Accordingly, I, Daniel Cairo, will bestow the title of Marquis to Count Vandenberg and grant him land and the power he deserves.”</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary greeting. It was a position that only two people in the kingdom held. After the death of one of them, the position had to be given to another person. And…</p>
<p>“On the Western Front, besides Count Vandenberg, there were heroes who risked their lives against the Kronos Empire. Baron Noel, Flora Lawrence… Rodwell Dmitry did an amazing job on the Western Front, and I will give each of them a promotion and a reward of 1,000 gold.”</p>
<p>“Ohhh!”</p>
<p>“Woah!”</p>
<p>People were shocked. The rewards given to the Western warriors were not stingy. Besides that, the words continued. Not just those who had defeated Kronos but also those who had helped in the plan to put down the rebellion were naturally included in the list. The King’s people, including Count Fabius, and the people of Roman Dmitry were included.</p>
<p>It was a festive time. The people cheered, and their expectations for one person began to rise. Roman Dmitry, what kind of reward would be given to him? According to common sense, it would be right to give him the best treatment, but there were too many rumors going around.</p>
<p>“Daniel Cairo has taken back the power in Cairo by subduing the factions, but with Roman Dmitry alive, does it mean anything? Roman Dmitry’s troops are stronger than the three factions. Maybe he will form a force that takes down the royal family at once, but that isn’t going to stop them from giving him a reward. The royal family is holding on to his existence right now. It is a bit cruel, but they might have to cut down Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>At the transfer of power, Roman Dmitry was at the center. The great abilities he had demonstrated were now a danger to the royal family. And just like how the royal family was unable to handle the three factions, it was clear that Roman Dmitry would turn into a being that the royal family couldn’t touch.</p>
<p>The rumors began to increase. Despite rising to power thanks to Roman Dmitry, they thought Daniel Cairo would betray the man. The eyes of the people were focused. And looking into their eyes, Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have won this war without Roman Dmitry’s help and the Dmitry family as well. I, Daniel Cairo, recognize their merits and grant the title of Duke to the Dmitry family, and I recognize that the area of the northeast, including the land of Dmitry, will be declared a Duchy. In addition, I promise to provide them with the necessary knowledge and power so that they can establish themselves as a nation.”</p>
<p>The King’s words put an end to all the doubts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It wasn’t like he didn’t know about the dangers of this decision. However, at the meeting held in the Royal Palace, all of those from the royal faction spoke in unison.</p>
<p>“We won the war thanks to Roman Dmitry. He deserves a fair reward.”</p>
<p>“Yes. You are right. Currently, the most horrid rumors are going around in Cairo, but we cannot let those words enter our ears and abandon the favor we have been given. We lived in a world where chaos was everywhere. It was a world where the four factions spoke over Your Majesty’s voice, and those who devoted themselves to the nation were not treated appropriately. If you make the same decision this time, the past is bound to happen again. We have to give what the people want, and that is expected.”</p>
<p>They also knew it. This one decision meant that Roman Dmitry would be out of their control. Even so, those who had lived in an unconventional world wanted Cairo to make the right decision.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“My thoughts are the same as yours. It doesn’t matter that the Dmitry family has enough power to surpass the three factions.”</p>
<p>During the series of events, Daniel Cairo saw and felt things he had never experienced until then. The layer of experiences piled up on the heart of the young king, and his own standard went up.</p>
<p>“The future of Cairo starts with acknowledging the reality. Dmitry is not something Cairo can control. Even if we try to keep them under our control, by defeating Marquis Benedict, they have proven that their power is beyond Cairo’s. Then it is appropriate to regard Dmitry as a Duchy and a friendly nation with equal footing.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a military relationship. Dmitry could regard Cairo as a military ally, but Cairo would never take their alliance for granted.</p>
<p>“Cairo has faced both internal and external enemies. External forces are infesting outside the borders, and the ones inside want to sell out the nation and threaten its safety. If only we would step away from being greedy in subduing Dmitry. Cairo has a firm shoulder on its side with Dmitry as an ally, as long as Cairo doesn’t cross the line.”</p>
<p>He no longer trembled. His mind felt clear, and he could see the way forward. He would keep his promise. And through his relationship with Dmitry, he planned to sketch the future of a new Cairo.</p>
<p>“I want to make use of this hard-earned opportunity. We are a small nation. A nation that cares about its people. Recognizing Dmitry as our ally from the start is a new beginning. People might think we are losing a huge amount of land, but by realizing their existence, we get the chance to build ourselves. The day that Dmitry officially declares itself a nation will be the start.”</p>
<p>He looked at the people. The Cairo royal family showed its desire for the first time.</p>
<p>“I, Daniel Cairo, will be happy with that.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The process and the proclamation of the Dmitry Dutchy came a week later. A ceremony and a party were scheduled in Dmitry, and at some point, rumors about Roman Dmitry spread.</p>
<p>“I am telling you it is him.”</p>
<p>“I told you. From the time he defeated the Hector Kingdom on the Southern Front, Roman Dmitry was no longer the eldest son of a Baron’s family. Even the King acknowledged him. Cairo ended the long-running power struggle against the three factions and even defeated the Kronos Empire in a matter of days, so how can anyone oppose him?”</p>
<p>“But how far can Roman Dmitry grow? I heard that he won against Kronos’s Knight Gustavo.”</p>
<p>At first, they admired him. The people of Cairo cheered at Roman Dmitry’s achievements, and then more rumors spread across the continent—just how great Dmitry truly was. Seeing what happened in the past, they emphasized that the Hero of Cairo was not a frog in a well.</p>
<p>“Is there anyone else in the world who has grown so much like Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“I assure you, there is no other monster like him. Even the one called the Greatest Sword of the Continent didn’t reach the 5-star level at Roman Dmitry’s age. He cannot be touched.”</p>
<p>“… perhaps, for the first time on the continent, a swordsman from the kingdom who can surpass the Demon’s 50th has appeared.”</p>
<p>The Demon’s 50th was the limit for the people of the kingdom, be it Count Nicholas or others. The people from the kingdom have never been named above it, and so Roman Dmitry’s name became a hot topic.</p>
<p>If he had the power to defeat Gustavo even when he was still in his 20s, then his potential for growth was extreme, and people predicted that he might surpass the 50th place before he even turned 30 years old.</p>
<p>Was it because of his unusual moves? People from the continent spoke of Roman Dmitry, and everyone was talking about him everywhere, even in the shabbiest pubs. Those who had finished their day tilted their beer mugs and pretended to wield swords as if they were Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And on the streets, bards would sing songs about him. Outside Cairo, Roman was being treated like a celebrity despite not knowing about it. And the more they talked about him, the higher his status rose.</p>
<p>Even though he was from a Baron’s family in Cairo, his potential and achievements during the civil war changed everything. Cairo even dared to say that they would recognize Dmitry as a nation. And the people’s interest in Roman Dmitry was directly connected to Dmitry.</p>
<p>It was said that his family, which would bring huge chaos to the continent, had taken its first step as a Duchy, so everyone on the continent turned their attention to Dmitry.</p>
<p>However, the series of rumors was not very natural. Of course, it was true that rumors began to get exaggerated, but they all started in a mansion in Cairos.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In a mansion in Cairos, a man received a report from his subordinate.</p>
<p>“The reactions are increasing from all over the continent. The main cause was the hired merchants who spread the rumors and the bards who were made to sing songs about Roman Dmitry being a hero. Now, even those outside Cairo know of Roman Dmitry. After all, the Lord’s plan was perfect.”</p>
<p>Just like his subordinate said, this was planned. Roman Dmitry’s name could be heard everywhere, yet the man wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>“No, this will not do. Roman Dmitry accomplished things that no one else could do in their lifetime. He defeated the Hector Kingdom on the Southern Front and took control of the messy Northeast, and this time, he caught the rebels and defeated the Kronos Empire. Just two years. That was the time it took for a Baron family to change into a Duchy.”</p>
<p>Not a single one of Roman’s achievements was easy. It was because only the big events were mentioned, but if one looked at them closely, so many things happened. The Star of Hector, Edwin Hector, Butler, Nicholas, and even Gustavo, who were ranked in the Continental Rankings.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s action had been odd to the extent that Homer, who was the first one he defeated, was being forgotten.</p>
<p>“Those who know Roman Dmitry’s success do not know of his growth. But some people tend to look down on what happened at the little well called Cairo. It’s those people we’re aiming for. From one end of the continent to the other, everyone should look up to Roman Dmitry. In order for him to become a hero recognized by the continent, we must spread his achievements for everyone to know and not just take small steps forward.”</p>
<p>He was thirsty and desperate. The man said,</p>
<p>“Ask the family to secure funds and release more people to do this. Rumors are a form of a messenger’s battle. The more one talks about Roman Dmitry, the more often people talk about him.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The subordinate lowered his head and left the room. The room was now silent, and the man grinned while thinking of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. Meeting you was a stroke of luck that I will never have again in my life.”</p>
<p>The identity of the man—he was none other than Henry Albert, the guy from the Southern Front.</p>

<p>Chapter 197 - Dmitry Duchy (2)</p>
<p>Henry Albert. How did he live all these years? Well, at first, he was doing just a simple job. As Roman Dmitry’s actions attracted people’s attention, the value of Henry Albert, his point of contact on the Southern Front, also increased.</p>
<p>The fact that he was from the Albert family, which was declining, didn’t matter. He was asked to lecture at the Cairo Royal Academy, which he wouldn’t have even dared to look at, and got the chance to teach the children of famous noble families.</p>
<p>At that time, he didn’t say anything about what happened on the Southern Front and how Roman Dmitry defeated the Hector Kingdom. He just shared what he saw and heard, and the students couldn’t take their eyes off him.</p>
<p>His life had changed so much. Children from noble families approached him to ask for his signature and looked up to him as if he were a hero. They didn’t know the truth. However, the mere fact that Henry Albert was there and experienced war made him appear to be a hero.</p>
<p>Just from one lecture, there was an explosive reaction, and more lectures lined up. Henry Albert just hoped to conduct regular lectures at the Royal Academy in Cairo, but now he was even being given the chance to stand on every high podium too.</p>
<p>But, of course, there was a price to pay. At first, people simply attended the lectures to spend some time knowing the story, but with time, people began to pay money to have Henry Albert speak.</p>
<p>Was it said that one’s position is what makes him a man? People could now recognize him when he walked down the street, so even Henry Albert, who had lived like a fool all his life, began to walk with confidence and a straight back.</p>
<p>He began to study because he was worried the students would ask him difficult questions during his lectures, and he tried to make himself look knowledgeable. Thanks to that, wealth and fame followed.</p>
<p>Everyone in his family was proud of him, and from that point on, they didn’t have to worry about money. Just one lecture brought in tens of gold. Some people would even give him one hundred gold.</p>
<p>“Ah, I am so happy.”</p>
<p>In only half a year, he managed to buy a luxurious mansion in Cairos. In the mansion that he purchased with the help of his acquaintances, whom he met from the lectures, and the nobles living close by, Henry was called a good noble neighbor. He now had the ideal life that he once imagined.</p>
<p>However, Henry Albert, who was sitting on a cozy sofa, suddenly felt like this comfort was all an illusion. In truth, he was nothing. He was lucky enough to live this kind of life, but it wouldn’t be strange at all if everything vanished the next day.</p>
<p>Happiness and unhappiness always go hand in hand. At first, he just enjoyed his happy life, but whenever anxiety rose, he would turn to alcohol. And one day, Henry Albert faced a truly shocking moment.</p>
<p>“Henry Albert. As I listened to your lectures, I couldn’t control my beating heart. It was thanks to the heroes on the Southern Front that Cairo was safe like this. Why are the people in this place not showing their gratitude? Thanks to you, I have come to know the reality of the world. From now on, I will contribute to the defense of Cairo and tell everyone how nice the lectures of Henry Albert are.”</p>
<p>He was a man in his late 60s. With gray hair and a beard, he was a leading professor at the Cairo Royal Academy. He was a man who was recognized for his skills, and such a person looked up to Henry.</p>
<p>It was so shocking. The children might not know much about him, but someone who was older and well-educated was looking up to him.</p>
<p>At that moment, Henry Albert had a realization.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His lectures—were they great? No, definitely not. The reason why people nodded their heads, cheered at every word he said, and went to see him as fans were entirely thanks to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>At first, he took advantage of the fame. However, when Roman Dmitry occupied the northeastern area, and the reactions towards him turned more passionate, he had to admit that things had changed.</p>
<p>The people’s interest in him came from Roman Dmitry. The more fame he gained, the more people wanted to know about Henry Albert, and the more he benefited from it.</p>
<p>‘Why are people going insane about me?’</p>
<p>That was what he thought. Why were his actions and words taken seriously when there were many other people on the Southern Front? The answer was simple—the contact with Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>When he was reporting back from the Southern Front, Henry Albert once took on the role of relaying information on behalf of Roman Dmitry. And it wasn’t because he was important.</p>
<p>Except for Roman Dmitry, there was no other noble who could face the King there, and so it was his face that appeared on the screen. At that moment, people realized that Henry Albert had taken on the role of Roman’s voice. And unlike the others who had served on the Southern Front, Henry Albert had a clear record.</p>
<p>‘People are projecting Roman Dmitry through me. They do not know who I am, but they consider me great because I took on the role of relaying Roman Dmitry’s message. It’s funny. When I was called the fool of the family, people looked down on me no matter how hard I worked, and even though I am still the same person now, the attitude they have toward me is different. It isn’t because they are stupid. Even the professors in the academy look up to me.’</p>
<p>Just one fact changed his life. Even if he wasn’t so great, he had the confidence to live a great life.</p>
<p>‘If I look back in the past, there have been heroes who made a name for themselves in the world. How did they all get their reputation? It wasn’t because they made some great achievements. It was because their neighbors talked about them. They became famous because many people shared stories about them. What I need to do to hold onto this wealth is now clear. It is to announce the achievements of Roman Dmitry to the world. If he continues to remain great like he is now, the fact that I shared a moment of joy and sorrow with him on the battlefield will give me a comfortable life.’</p>
<p>Spreading rumors wasn’t difficult because Roman Dmitry was constantly talked about.</p>
<p>The Hector Kingdom and the Dmitry Alliance. From the Public Ranking Match to the Civil War, the grounds were overflowing with talks. He just made them all known to the people, and everyone considered Roman Dmitry a hero. As a result, Henry Albert naturally turned into an ally of the hero.</p>
<p>He laid down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. I am not as great as people think. But you continue to live the life that others look up to. I will let the world know who you are for the sake of my comfortable life.”</p>
<p>Top quality wine was sweet. The mansion he lived in, the sofa, and the wine—they were proof that Henry was on the right path. It was the new life of the guy who was once called a fool.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Henry’s methods worked. Thanks to the rumors that were circulating, attention on Roman Dmitry increased. And, of course, the biggest concern was the declaration of the Dmitry Duchy.</p>
<p>During the time when Roman, the hero of Cairo, was taking his first step into history, even people from other nations expressed their intention to attend the proclamation ceremony. All of them were longing to hear more about Roman Dmitry. Even if the rumors were only half true, it was worth the distance.</p>
<p>Days before the announcement, Dmitry was distracted by people flocking from all over the continent. In particular, the Knights’ Captain Jonathan, who was in charge of guarding the castle’s gate, showed admiration as he confirmed the faces of the people.</p>
<p>‘To see so many people from other nations flocking to see Roman Dmitry. There are even key figures from other nations among them. People from the Frank Kingdom came yesterday, and the representatives from the three kingdoms of the alliance arrived this morning. That just shows that the Kingdoms’ Alliance acknowledges Dmitry’s existence.’</p>
<p>It was such a new feeling. Until a few years ago, Dmitry was just a bug in the Northeast. The nobles wouldn’t recognize them since they originated as a commoner’s family, and when Jonathan swore his allegiance to Dmitry, his friends were shocked.</p>
<p>It was a natural reaction. As a 3-star aura swordsman, his future was guaranteed, but his choice was what they didn’t understand.</p>
<p>But now things had changed. Dmitry’s value soared to the point where his colleagues asked if they still had any vacancies.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. It is all thanks to him.’</p>
<p>He knew it as well. Baron Romero’s greed wasn’t that great, so they might still have had a bad relationship with Barco if Roman hadn’t stepped forward and made a change.</p>
<p>A change made by one man. It changed everyone’s attitude towards them, and Dmitry’s people were no longer bowing their heads because they were commoners. Their existence became great.</p>
<p>All those who went to visit Dmitry wanted to meet one person, and Roman Dmitry became the pride of Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘Jonathan. Keep your mind straight, and do not get drunk with joy.’</p>
<p>With that in mind, he chose to be the sword that protects Dmitry. He had to prepare for unexpected variables.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as he carefully inspected the visitors, his eyes widened when he discovered an unexpected person.</p>
<p>“… you are?!”</p>
<p>The man in front of him was not someone who deserved to be in Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Baron Romero summoned his two sons.</p>
<p>‘Before the announcement of Dmitry becoming a Duchy, I need to settle the issue of succession. If I give more hope to everyone halfway, there will be problems after the dukedom has been declared.’</p>
<p>A conflict between blood relatives was not an outcome he wanted. Some fathers watched their sons compete and passed everything to the winner, but he didn’t want that. In fact, his mind was already tilted to one side.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry had dedicated his entire life to the family since he was a child, but could he be sure that if he declared him as the successor, there wouldn’t be any resistance from other family members?</p>
<p>So he called for a meeting. The youngest wasn’t invited because he wasn’t competing in the succession.</p>
<p><em>Knock. Knock.</em></p>
<p>“Father, may I come in?”</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>The door opened, and at the sight of the two siblings entering, Baron Romero showed a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“The reason I have called you all here is to clear up the issue with the succession. As you all know, in a few days, the Dmitry estate will be declared a dukedom. It doesn’t simply mean that we will become more powerful; our responsibilities will change. Many lives will depend on us. That is why I want to make a decision right now.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a loud voice. This position was for the head of the Dmitry house.</p>
<p>Baron Romero looked at Rodwell Dmitry. The fact that he had to say something bad to his son, who had lost an eye on the battlefield, made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Actually, he had a right to the position. If he said that the decision was unfair, then he would just summon the main people of the estate and conduct a fair election.</p>
<p>It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“Father. I have something to say first.”</p>
<p>Rodwell said.</p>
<p>When Baron Romero looked at him with a questioning look, he said with a calm face,</p>
<p>“I will give up the position of the successor. Rather than me, Brother Roman is a better fit for it.”</p>
<p>When he arrived at Dmitry after the war, he had been through a lot in the last few days.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 198 - Dmitry Duchy (3)</p>
<p>Dmitry—it was the home that he hadn’t returned to in a long time. Rodwell, who had left to prove himself in the capital, recalled the past.</p>
<p>‘How many years has it been?’</p>
<p>He couldn’t remember it. What was certain was that the environment outside Dmitry wasn’t a good place to live in. Obviously, he was sure that when he returned, there would still be the stench of slums and shabby houses. However, now there was a nicely built village.</p>
<p>He couldn’t find the people with dark and despondent expressions anymore. There were well-fed and well-brought-up children running around with smiles.</p>
<p>And then he turned to the castle walls of Dmitry, which were so overwhelming to look at. It looked a lot higher than before. Not just that, but it had become a structure ready for battle with defensive magic circles and devices on it.</p>
<p>‘A lot had happened.’</p>
<p>While he was away, Dmitry was caught up in the whirlwind of war. There was the fight with Barco, the trouble with the Lords of the North, who tried to conquer the Northeast, and then the commander of the rebels, Marquis Benedict, showed his intention of attacking Dmitry.</p>
<p>Because of those events, Dmitry changed over and over again. If at one time it felt outlandish, then Dmitry is now a place that could be called a kingdom.</p>
<p>The war ended, and Rodwell Dmitry was ordered to take leave. Dmitry was now a dukedom, but that didn’t separate them from Cairo. The parts bordering other nations, like the West and the South, were decided to be common defense points, and he was told that he could continue his life in the West if he wanted to.</p>
<p>In addition, since he was promised a promotion for his contribution to the war, when he returns now, he will be at the level of a captain.</p>
<p>He was at a crossroads of choice. Would he stay in Dmitry? Or would he head to the West again?</p>
<p>Returning to Dmitry to make up his mind, he set aside his emotions and entered the gates, and he was impressed. It was so different from what he remembered.</p>
<p>“… what happened here?”</p>
<p>The nicely built roads and buildings—it was an incredible development for a city on the border, and the most eye-catching part was Dmitry’s soldiers.</p>
<p>He already felt it when he entered, but the soldiers who were just patrolling were so well-trained. They made minimal movements and had sharp eyes. Their refusal to allow anything wrong to happen reminded him of Roman’s men on the battlefield.</p>
<p>He was sure of it—they had all changed. They were not just mediocre soldiers on the outskirts, but they were now comparable to those of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Rodwell walked down the streets. Everything was so unfamiliar to him. It hadn’t been that long since he left Dmitry, and this change wasn’t something he could accept right away.</p>
<p>He needed some time to understand all of this. He went into an unknown diner, took a seat, and listened to what people were saying while sipping beer.</p>
<p>“Hehehe. Did that happen?”</p>
<p>“It did. Because a rookie made a mistake, all of us almost got buried under the tunnel. If Mr. Roman Dmitry hadn’t ensured the safety of that place, I wouldn’t be here either.”</p>
<p>“Right. I haven’t heard of anyone dying ever since the relics were installed in the mines.”</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to Mr. Roman Dmitry that my life was saved.”</p>
<p>“Cheers!”</p>
<p><em>Tak!</em></p>
<p>They bumped their beer mugs. Those who seemed to be miners in the iron mine were talking about Roman Dmitry, and the situation at the other tables wasn’t much different. Roman Dmitry was always at the center of what they talked about.</p>
<p>Hearing about Roman Dmitry’s performance on the battlefield, they seemed to feel immense pride in being a member of Dmitry.</p>
<p>One city was so lively. Dmitry managed to secure jobs for the villagers in the mine, and the money earned from it was being used for people’s consumption.</p>
<p>Naturally, the people were enjoying it. And since they knew that Roman Dmitry was the reason they could live this way, they never stopped talking about him.</p>
<p>There was a gap in his memory. Before Rodwell left this place, his older brother was made fun of.</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>He drank the beer, and then….</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He put down the drink and got up. The taste was so bitter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The same night, Rodwell Dmitry couldn’t sleep. The second son of a Baron’s family—why did he work so diligently? There was no amazing reason for it.</p>
<p>He tried his best to simply become a person suitable for Dmitry, but the world changed while he was away. Roman Dmitry, whom everyone joked about, no longer existed. When he saw and heard those things on the streets, he realized just how much Dmitry’s people respected Roman Dmitry now.</p>
<p>He was devastated, and his mind felt complicated. The current Dmitry estate knew more about Roman Dmitry than he did.</p>
<p>“… seriously like a beggar.”</p>
<p>His efforts in the past qualified him to become the successor. Roman Dmitry was sleeping when he trained with the sword. He would drink while Rodwell studied, and Roman would meet women when Rodwell raised his voice toward the guards. So, everyone assumed that Rodwell Dmitry would become the family’s successor.</p>
<p>Even when he left Dmitry, people said that fact wouldn’t change, and now they couldn’t hide the uncomfortable look on their faces as they met him after such a long time. They felt bad since their hearts were now tilted toward Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>It was the cruel reality. He was saddened by the collapse of the things he had worked hard for. However, Rodwell didn’t resent them. Hadn’t he already seen the results? Dmitry developed, the people were living a happy life, and their Baron family was now a Duchy.</p>
<p>Each of his actions was spotless. So Roman Dmitry seemed to be better suited to be the successor.</p>
<p>‘And I lost my eye.’</p>
<p>Having just one eye felt like a cold truth. Losing an eye as a swordsman was so much different than he thought. The sword felt so foreign to him in every direction he moved it, and even his sense of distance wasn’t entirely accurate.</p>
<p>He looked at the sky. It was such a dark night, like his own future.</p>
<p>‘There is no place for me in Dmitry. And even if I go back to the West, I will not become someone whom they want me to be.’</p>
<p>It was a dead end. Honestly, regardless of the reason, Rodwell Dmitry couldn’t forget what Roman Dmitry looked like on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Other people would have only heard of it by hearsay. However, unlike them, who only talked about Roman dealing with Gustavo, Rodwell witnessed it in person with his own two eyes.</p>
<p>The power he held was so shocking. Seeing him splatter blood every time he blinks, he gave up his position to be the successor right then.</p>
<p>The Dmitry Duchy. They were not a Baron’s family anymore. In order to rule the Northeastern region, Roman Dmitry was more suited to be the successor. He organized his thoughts throughout the night.</p>
<p>One day, two days.</p>
<p>As he was spending time alone, he was summoned by his father, so he went to his office. And then he spoke of the conclusion he had reached after much thought.</p>
<p>“I am not saying that I will yield simply because he is the eldest son. After arriving in Dmitry and observing the lives of the people, I have learned that the majority of the people already accepted him as the successor, and I do not blame my time in the capital. Even if I had stayed in Dmitry, I wouldn’t have shown what Brother Roman did, and it might have just hastened the decision of the people compared to now. Father. For the future of Dmitry, I don’t want to talk about that. And….”</p>
<p>Dmitry’s genius and Dmitry’s future had lost his path. He looked up at Baron Romero with a face different from the past.</p>
<p>“Please let me go. For the time being, I think I need time for myself, not Dmitry.”</p>
<p>He got up and said his goodbyes as he left.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Two people were left, and Baron Romero said,</p>
<p>“… well, I had put too much of a burden on Rodwell. Because you, the eldest son, were called a fool. Because of people who say that commoners have limitations by birth, I believed Rodwell might be the person best suited to be in charge of the family after observing him become dedicated to training and outperforming others.”</p>
<p>His chest felt stuffy. His second son had always been dignified. Perhaps because he trusted him too much, the last glance his son showed him stuck in his heart.</p>
<p>“At a young age, Rodwell lived a life where his father expected too much from him. He trusted me and followed every word I said. At first, the child, who was so young, did everything with a strong look in his eyes and without saying any complaint. Rodwell was the pride of Dmitry. And today, I told Rodwell, who has lived all his life for Dmitry, that he couldn’t be the successor. What a cruel thing it is. But I still don’t think that choice is wrong. For the future of Dmitry’s people, it is only right for you, Roman, to become the successor.”</p>
<p>But as a father, his mind felt burdened. As the head of the family, the decision he made was right, but from the moment Rodwell left, his face was stained with sadness.</p>
<p>‘I am not a good father.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a sore thumb, so he paid more attention to him. He took for granted every great thing that Rodwell did. However, when Roman Dmitry did something well, he was so happy because he was the child who shared his life as a commoner. Back then, he believed that it was right for a father to take care of a sad child.</p>
<p>Whereas, for Rodwell Dmitry, he thought that he should pass down the family to him as compensation.</p>
<p>After getting older and living his life, he ended up becoming a clumsy person, even as a parent. People admired Baron Romero as a political figure. However, he wasn’t a good father.</p>
<p>“Roman.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I am not a smart person. Even after doing something I would regret, I still don’t know what to do as a father. Normally, I would ask your mother about it. But now, there is something I wish to ask of you.”</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>The father and son looked at each other. For Dmitry’s new future, rather than living a life that the people would look up to, he wanted Dmitry to be Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Take care of your sibling. He is a child who has lost a lot. I am not sure if asking this of you is good for Rodwell, but I don’t think it is bad for a family to do what it means to be a family. I am a father to both you and Rodwell. Just as you work hard even if your father is lacking, I hope you do so for our family too. This is my last request from you, who will inherit Dmitry.”</p>
<p>At the word ‘family,’ Roman Dmitry paused for a moment. He wasn’t used to his present life since it was so different from the previous one he had.</p>
<p>“I understand, Father.”</p>
<p>A plain answer.</p>
<p>At those words, Baron Romero finally showed a comfortable smile.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He soon left the office. Roman Dmitry walked down the hallway, looking down at his hands.</p>
<p>‘In my previous life, I used these hands to kill my own blood relatives.’</p>
<p>It was still vivid—the faces of those who tried to kill him and ended up being killed, and the curses he heard until their breathing stopped.</p>
<p>The siblings with whom he thought he had a good bond were the same. At the moment when he ended their lives, they blamed him when he put pressure on their throats and not their father, who instigated it. That was the life of Baek Joong-hyuk and his brothers.</p>
<p>However, his present life was different. When he met Lauren Dmitry and spoke to Rodwell Dmitry, Roman felt calm.</p>
<p>“Foolish bastard.”</p>
<p>It was pathetic. Rodwell looked like he had lost the world just because he lost an eye, and now he just gave up the position of the successor without another thought. It was something he couldn’t have imagined in his previous life.</p>
<p>Unlike his brothers, who were desperate to hold power, Rodwell didn’t want a dispute in their family.</p>
<p>The world was tough. He was his younger brother and someone born with the same blood as him, so he wasn’t going to let Rodwell Dmitry collapse like this.</p>
<p>What kind of person did he have as an older brother, and what did it mean to live as a Dmitry? He was thinking of showing it to him this time.</p>
<p>He took a step and arrived at Dmitry’s training room, where Rodwell was swinging his sword under the sun.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 199 - Dmitry Duchy (4)</p>
<p>In the middle of the training room, Rodwell Dmitry looked at his sword. Unlike before, one side of his vision was dark, and there was this unknown sense of unbalance in his body.</p>
<p>There was a momentary feeling of hate. At one time, the tool called a sword was so familiar, as if it were a part of his body, but now even his own body wasn’t following him.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>And then he ran forward. The muscles he had trained for years were screaming, and he swung his sword against the imaginary enemy.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>It was a short hair difference, and the attack missed. The information transmitted through his senses correctly judged the location of his opponent, but when he swung the sword, the opponent seemed a lot farther away.</p>
<p>There was now a gap in his senses. His brain used the senses based on his memories in the past, but the senses that conveyed the current information gave different information because of the loss of his one eye.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and continued to attack without stopping, but not a single attack was done correctly.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>It was the same now. Even though he was exchanging blows with his imaginary opponent and launching dangerous attacks, he wasn’t even able to scratch the opponent. Thus, he couldn’t produce a satisfactory scene.</p>
<p>His attacks were too shallow, and he was the one dying. When his imaginary opponent killed him, Rodwell gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>It was fine to die. Just once, he wanted to be able to use his senses properly. However, the moment that even the last attack that he tried so hard to do was unsuccessful, he felt his heart sink.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>He fell down badly. Blood flowed from his forehead, but Rodwell looked up at the sky with a dazed face.</p>
<p>The battle with Kronos—he didn’t regret risking his life there. If he could turn back time, he would have made the same decision for the sake of Cairo. However, the realities he had to accept were too difficult.</p>
<p>Even though he had lived for the future of Dmitry all his life, he had to acknowledge that he had to give up the position of successor. Because Roman Dmitry showed stronger results, Rodwell Dmitry lost the greatest goal of his life, and his unstable physical condition made his swordsmanship shaky.</p>
<p>Everything changed, so he himself gave up on being the successor. Even though it was the conclusion that he himself had thought of, the emotions he was feeling were too much.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky. It was sunny. Contrary to his own thoughts, Rodwell looked at the calm sky and smiled. He was annoyed, but he wasn’t exactly blaming anyone. If he had been strong enough not to lose an eye, then he would have been a more suitable successor than Roman Dmitry. In the series of events, there was no reason for him to act strong.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He got up with his sword. He was a man of honor. He didn’t know what had caused his brother to change, but he had no intention of staying as the stain in the family.</p>
<p>So what if he wasn’t the successor? So what if he lost an eye? He would do it all over again. [TL/N: Fight in such a situation.] Gritting his teeth, Rodwell Dmitry began to swing his sword.</p>
<p>He was a mess. There was no longer the sharpness in his movements that he had before, so he tried to adapt to only having one eye. The sun was hot, making his sweat drip like rain.</p>
<p>“That will not solve the problem.”</p>
<p>Said a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was standing on one side.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Your body has been training on how to wield the sword in a normal state for a long time. Your loss of one eye doesn’t mean there is a restriction in your vision, but everything will start to change. It isn’t that your current method is wrong, but there is a way to be more certain of your growth.”</p>
<p>At the time of conquering Murim, many of his subordinates lost different body parts. They had gaps in their senses and numerous handicaps, so different ways to overcome them were created.</p>
<p>“Shut off your five senses and start from the initial point again. If you practice utilizing only one of your senses without recognizing that you’ve lost one, the gap won’t be an issue when you utilize all five senses later on. Of course, blocking all five of your senses is impossible to train. But if you want to, you can try it.”</p>
<p>It was honest advice. He said it in the best way, but Rodwell didn’t seem happy.</p>
<p>“And why should I listen to you, Brother?”</p>
<p>Blocking out a sense could be the answer. Even if it was a short-term solution, Rodwell Dmitry didn’t want to follow Roman’s advice. It was a matter of emotion.</p>
<p>While he did acknowledge Roman Dmitry’s growth and how he was the most suited heir, he still didn’t want to accept his help now. It was that kind of reaction.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry looked away and focused on sword training again.</p>
<p>“The choice is yours. But they are facts you should know.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a conversation. It was a one-sided message. Even if the other person ignored his words, Roman Dmitry spoke honestly.</p>
<p>“Dmitry has now stepped into a new phase. There will be many hurdles from now on, and we do not know what tricks the Kronos Empire and Valhalla will do. In addition, we cannot trust the Kingdoms’ Alliance just yet as we are not allies. At this time, we need to defend ourselves. If we break down and let our emotions eat us, those who believe in us will be the ones paying the price.”</p>
<p>The scope of the fence was widening. As he accepted new relationships, Roman’s values also changed. If he would follow the laws of his previous life, he wouldn’t be pursuing such a direction.</p>
<p>“I need people I can trust for the future of Dmitry. Until now, I was able to handle everything on my own, but with time, I will have no choice but to face my limit. If Dmitry is attacked while I am away from a battle on the borders, and if the empire chooses to attack, I need people to replace me on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>His conquest of Murim wasn’t something he did on his own. In Baek Joong-hyuk’s absence, there were people who could replace him and were called the Four Kings. And so…</p>
<p>“Rodwell Dmitry. You are my younger brother and blood. If I need someone to lead Dmitry in my absence….”</p>
<p>It was a relationship based on trust. A need for mutual exchange should sometimes come from blind emotions on one side.</p>
<p>“I hope it will be you.”</p>
<p>Those were his last words, and Rodwell Dmitry’s eyes widened. His older brother from a long time ago, whom he thought no longer existed, was now in front of him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time went by, and the day of the proclamation ceremony finally arrived. People flocked to the castle of Dmitry, and the ceremony for the declaration of Dmitry becoming a Duchy was held in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Today is a very meaningful day for Cairo and the Salamander continent. Recently, Cairo has experienced events that threatened the security of the nation. The traitorous Marquis Benedict brought the Kronos Empire to his aid, and the battles in the West terrified the people. Actually, the former Cairo would have chosen to compromise in that situation. Even in situations where we were not wrong, we always bowed our heads first, and at one time, I thought it was supposed to be that way. But then the Dmitry family proved that I was wrong. They awakened Cairo’s pride and showed how the nation should move forward for it to exist.”</p>
<p>His voice was gaining strength. The experience was slowly developing him, and now he could handle it.</p>
<p>He glanced at the people. From the Kingdoms’ Alliance and to the Hector Kingdom, and to those who attended the ceremony to celebrate Dmitry Duchy, he expressed his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Dmitry deserves a new start with everyone’s blessings. I, Daniel Cairo, as the King of the Cairo Kingdom, will sincerely congratulate our ally, Dmitry Duchy, and do my best to develop the community of both nations.”</p>
<p>And at that moment, cheers erupted. Dmitry’s people were cheering, and important figures from other nations knew what Daniel Cairo’s remarks meant.</p>
<p>They were friendly nations, and that meant one wasn’t below another. On an equal footing, he was standing with the Dmitry Duchy.</p>
<p>‘… Cairo has recognized the Dmitry Duchy as having its own individual force, and they are putting wings on the back of Dmitry even when people are going insane with Dmitry’s actions.’</p>
<p>It was someone’s idea.</p>
<p>And that was what Daniel Cairo intended.</p>
<p>When Baron Romero stepped onto the stage after the King was done, Dmitry was in a festive mood.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The festival continued. The Dmitry family prepared a separate seat for the nobles in the inner courtyard, and outside, food was prepared so that the common people could enjoy the party.</p>
<p>It was a scene that showed how rich Dmitry was. It would require a lot of money to feed thousands of mouths, but Duke Romero wasn’t stingy.</p>
<p>In Dmitry’s mines, since safety devices had been installed, the amount of wealth they were earning from them had completely exceeded the normal level. From the endless mountains, minerals that people never knew existed were excavated.</p>
<p>There were plenty of jobs, and as rumors circulated that Dmitry was completely safe, workers from outside Dmitry were also rushing over.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s development was just a natural result. With supply and demand in perfect harmony, Dmitry grew into a large city to the extent that treating the people lavishly wouldn’t make Dmitry lose money.</p>
<p>It was such a good time. As people ate and talked, representatives from other nations came to talk to Duke Romero.</p>
<p>“Duke Dmitry, Roman Dmitry is already in his 20s, so shouldn’t he be getting married sometime soon? A man can do great things only when his family is stable. Just in time, the princess of the Umberto Kingdom is also at the right age to get married, so how about setting up a time?”</p>
<p>The representative of the Umberto Kingdom, Count Verdi, asked.</p>
<p>When he directly spoke about marriage, Duke Romero showed a troubled expression.</p>
<p>“I also hope Roman finds a good match, but as you all know, Roman has his own flaws. Even though he was engaged to a woman, he didn’t go through with it in the end, so how can I talk about marriage to him again? Actually, I just hope that he never gets into danger. That is more important to me than his marriage.”</p>
<p>He avoided answering it. Usually, for nobles, the right age to find a partner was during their late teens. However, with Roman’s reputation as a fool, many people didn’t want him, and the one marriage he tried to have failed.</p>
<p>It was a matter that the Dmitry family thought about a lot, and Duke Romero considered that his marriage was not a priority anymore due to the incident with Lawrence.</p>
<p>Besides, breaking up was a huge problem. There was a high chance that the nobles who were sensitive to the issue wouldn’t take the risk of breaking up their marriage. However….</p>
<p>“A flaw? He is Dmitry’s Hero, having defeated Gustavo in his 20s. So who would consider one breakup as a flaw? The life of a hero is full of twists and turns. If people consider breaking an engagement as a flaw, then I will arrange a marriage with a wise woman who appreciates Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>“Right. He is now the heir to the Duchy, too, so breaking off the marriage isn’t a problem at all.”</p>
<p>They were the members of the Kingdoms’ Alliance, Viscount Ringo from the Redford Kingdom and Marquis Marten of the Odelia Kingdom. Representing each kingdom, they added their words to Count Verdi’s remarks.</p>
<p>At that moment, their eyes met. From the remarks that had just been made, everyone knew they had a common purpose here.</p>
<p>‘These guys are here for Roman Dmitry!’</p>
<p>‘Damn them!’</p>
<p>‘How dare they!’</p>
<p>As they looked into each other’s eyes, competition rose.</p>
