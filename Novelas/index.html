<p>Chapter 168 - Cairo’s First Sword (3)</p>
<p>Richard Nicholas, the 1st ranker in Cairo. People acknowledged this man as the best sword in Cairo but they also said that they would not live life the way he did.</p>
<p>“What pleasures does the Count live by? Even though he has been the best for a long time, instead of enjoying wealth and honor, he goes back to relive his training days each day. What a boring person. If I had the skills like his, I would live a comfortable life by siding with Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>But there was a time when Count Nicholas also thought of such things.</p>
<p>And his schedule felt boring. According to his servant, he lived at the training grounds most of the day except for the time he meditated in the mornings.</p>
<p>From the basic movements to advance sword skills, Count Nicholas would be drenched in sweat as he kept repeating the process and sparring with his subordinates. That was his schedule from morning to evening.</p>
<p>And when he skipped his external duties as a Royal Knight, he would focus on his sword technique.</p>
<p>And he was now over sixty years old.</p>
<p>Even though he was the best swordsman in his youth, considering the social status he held, no one understood why he still lived on the training grounds.</p>
<p>But he still continued to live the same way. No matter what people said about him, the sword never left his hands.</p>
<p>The reason?</p>
<p>Because he liked it?</p>
<p>Because he was crazy for swords?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, Count Nicholas forcibly closed his eyes from the aura rising from within him.</p>
<p>‘I don’t want to live this fiercely either.’</p>
<p>In his sixty years of life, he lived his entire life for the royal family. Count Nicholas, who was flogged for being lazy in sword training when he was young, was now a pillar of support for the royal family.</p>
<p>He knew it too. What would happen the moment he became a little weak? And the fact that the Cairo royal family was bound to collapse like a sand castle due to the evil people aiming for the throne.</p>
<p>That couldn’t happen. The royal family was everything Nicholas had. His blind feelings for the family, which had been imprinted in his head, turned Count Nicholas into someone who treasured the family, even if people thought it was boring. And so he held his resolve.</p>
<p>And when he heard the rumors that Roman Dmitry had defeated Butler, the Count went to the training grounds and continued to train against an imaginary opponent all day long.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo and the former King’s smiles and kind words gave the Count a reason to live. The existence that people called great believed and followed the value of mere humans.</p>
<p>One day, his son who lived a normal life unlike him asked,</p>
<p>“Father, why do you do that?”</p>
<p>His father was exhausted each day. Contrary to his fame and name, his father would always return home with a shabby appearance.</p>
<p>At the words of his son, who gave up the sword because he didn’t want to be like him, Count Nicholas showed a heartfelt smile.</p>
<p>“Son, I am the First Sword of Cairo. People call Cairo a small nation and look down on us, but in the small nation called Cairo, I am an existence that no one can approach. That is the purpose of my life.”</p>
<p>And today, people didn’t know the fact that in order to face Roman Dmitry, who was a young challenger, the Count had been preparing for a year before the Ranking Matches were even announced.</p>
<p>Cairo’s First Sword, Richard Nicholas, was completely different from the others that Roman had stepped on.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The ground shook.</p>
<p>In the middle of a violently raging sandstorm, Count Nicholas pushed Roman.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>His face changed. In the beginning, Roman led the attack, but this time, the Count was the one leading.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry doesn’t run.’</p>
<p>Last year, Count Nicholas studied the data about Roman. The testimonies of when Roman faced Homer, the battles on the Southern Front, and when he defeated Butler—he kept all the facts that were informative in his head.</p>
<p>People would ask why the person considered the best in the nation was wary of a young man in his mid-20s, but the Count was the type that did his best in everything he did. The opponent was brilliant and talented, and if he couldn’t overcome him with talent, then he had to press him down with experience.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>There was a huge roar.</p>
<p>With the goal of not letting his opponent run away, he deliberately raised his aura.</p>
<p>Since the aura that distorted the atmosphere couldn’t be stopped just by dodging, Roman raised his sword to block it.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakang!</em></p>
<p>And that was when it started.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry attacked with the best moves he could think of. Instead of judging with his eyes, he began to continuously attack under the assumption that the opponent would block all his attacks.</p>
<p>Right, left, left, and overhead.</p>
<p>Continuing to change the pattern of his attacks, Roman Dmitry blocked all the chances to prevent the Count from coming up with a new move.</p>
<p>One breath.</p>
<p>The price to pay was high.</p>
<p>Cairo’s First Sword attacked by taking the initiative in one flow.</p>
<p>“Wow.”</p>
<p>“… this is the best sword in Cairo.”</p>
<p>The people who were looking from afar were shocked at this. Even though they couldn’t properly see the fight because of the sandstorm, Count Nicholas displayed a tremendous presence. They were certain that Count Nicholas was an existence different from the others.</p>
<p>Oscar, who was ranked second, wasn’t even in the continental rankings, but Count Nicholas ranked 80th. And that was five years ago. Even after that, this man never neglected his training, and the people said that if he challenged others, his rank would rise.</p>
<p>He was at the age of sixty and he was starting to get old. However, he clearly demonstrated how he was able to support the power system in Cairo.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas made his way through the storm. To protect the honor of the royal family and to prove that he was strong, he never delayed his attacks since he knew that he could die from a single mistake.</p>
<p>Just like that, Count Nicholas was roaring. And the more his presence burned, the more Roman Dmitry also began to burn.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Nicholas was strong. Living as Roman Dmitry, he had met a lot of people, but he was sure that none of them were as strong as the Count.</p>
<p>‘He is one level higher than Butler.’</p>
<p>The fight was intense, and it made his blood boil. Ever since he stayed silent for the past year, Roman has waited for a moment like this.</p>
<p><em>Kaaanng!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>He swung his sword. To meet his opponent’s intention and respond to him, he fought him head-on. Without backing down at all, Roman Dmitry countered the opponent’s attack head-on.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>There was a great rumble.</p>
<p>The head-to-head fight drained their minds, but both of them didn’t back down. The First Sword of Cairo? No, the stronger the opponent, the better. Roman Dmitry just wanted to crush his opponent with force.</p>
<p>‘Count Nicholas is strong. But in the end, he is only strong by the standards of Cairo. There are dozens of beings on the continent that are stronger than him, and I cannot even predict how many of them haven’t revealed their identities to the world. For the future, I need to overwhelm Count Nicholas.’</p>
<p>He acknowledged his opponent. If he had been on the same level as Oscar, Roman Dmitry would have ended the fight without prolonging it for another second.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>Nicholas moved to attack. His sword, which was covered in aura, fell like stars from the sky.</p>
<p>Roman stepped forward. Following his opponent’s intention, he also raised his aura to counter it.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>There was a series of clashes as the two continuously collided. As if the fight would end with a single hit, they didn’t want to back out.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Just one hit, but Count Nicholas’s expression changed. It was subtle, but he could feel his body bounce a little at the repulsive force.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>It was the same this time too. He raised his strength more than before, but he was only pushed back further.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>Every time they clashed, Count Nicholas was being pushed back little by little. He obviously had the upper hand at the start, but the more he faced his opponent, the more he saw a new reality.</p>
<p>As if his body was wet from rain, the results piled up once again. The fact that he was being pushed back further made him belatedly realize something was wrong.</p>
<p>‘I am being pushed back by strength.’</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the people who were watching began to realize that the flow of the fight was going in a strange direction.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>People had a particular image in their minds prior to this fight. If Roman Dmitry caused an uproar here, they thought it wouldn’t be from an overwhelming fight.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is just in his mid-20s. No matter how great a swordsman he is, he cannot compete with the aura of Count Nicholas, who has trained for sixty years. Because Count Nicholas is superior in every way, Roman Dmitry must devise a variable that will allow him to win.”</p>
<p>That was what everyone thought, but the results in front of their eyes were different.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Count Nicholas was being pushed back. At first, he was only pushed back so little that it wasn’t noticeable, but now it was one step after another.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>This time, he was pushed back behind the line.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas gritted his teeth. The more he blocked Roman Dmitry’s sword, the more disgusted he was feeling.</p>
<p>‘This makes no sense.’</p>
<p>He was shocked. He was not different from the others. He prepared for a year to face Roman Dmitry, but he never thought that he would be crushed like this. It was not arrogance but confidence in himself.</p>
<p>Because of his experience for sixty years, he was sure that the aura of a swordsman in his mid-20s wouldn’t be much.</p>
<p>His common sense crumbled. The opponent was a monster. People called the Count a genius, but even in the realm of geniuses, Roman appeared to be stronger.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He was now pushed all the way back.</p>
<p><em>“Cough.”</em></p>
<p>In an instant, he coughed up blood. The shock of the constant attacks made thick blood drip down his mouth as if his organs were messed up.</p>
<p>The eye-catching red drops of blood continued to drip down, and the Count sighed.</p>
<p>Being the supporting power of the Cairo royal family, he tried so hard to not make it collapse, and he was wary of the nobles’ faction but not of the young blood.</p>
<p>What if.…</p>
<p>….he lost?</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was claiming to be neutral, but he would never help the King. According to what he knew about him, this man was a practical person.</p>
<p>Unlike him, who had devoted his life to being loyal one-sidedly, Roman would never do that to the royal family.</p>
<p>‘I can’t lose.’</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth and gulped. He suppressed the disgusting smell of blood, and he looked at his opponent.</p>
<p>It was funny how Roman Dmitry was giving him time, as if telling him to calm down and fight him again with all his might. Seeing the guy who was just a challenger act like the champion, the Count raised his aura.</p>
<p>‘Fine, I am not grateful at this consideration.’</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He held his sword one last time. If even this attack failed, then there was no way to defeat Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He kicked the ground.</p>
<p>This time, Roman Dmitry confronted him head-on.</p>
<p>Aura explosion.</p>
<p>It was Count Nicholas’s secret. When he manifested the power that made him the 80th ranker, the aura surrounding his sword burned like a volcano.</p>
<p>‘This is the end.’</p>
<p>It was then that the Count clearly saw it. Even facing an aura that burned like it would devour the world, and even if one understood what it meant, Roman Dmitry didn’t dodge the attack.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 169 - Cairo’s First Sword (4)</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The earth shook. The shockwaves on the ground caused the onlookers to stumble or be thrown backward, and the outcome of the fight was obscured by a cloud of dust that prevented them from seeing it.</p>
<p>This wasn’t a fight between humans. The people who were now covered in dust just looked around with shocked faces.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>The wind blew. And once the situation was revealed, everyone’s eyes went wide.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p><em>“… cough.“</em></p>
<p>Count Nicholas was down on one knee. Even as blood flowed from his mouth and nose, he raised his head and looked at the man in front of him.</p>
<p>‘Was I defeated?’</p>
<p>In their last clash, Count Nicholas did his best. He was convinced that the head-to-head confrontation would be a sure move, but Roman didn’t back down and attacked him head-on.</p>
<p>And this was the result.</p>
<p>Even his own attack, which he had trained for sixty years, was unable to defeat Roman Dmitry, and he ended up coughing up blood.</p>
<p>And the sight of Roman looking down at him with an unstrained face made him feel more miserable.</p>
<p>‘This is it.’</p>
<p>The match was decided, with Roman Dmitry as the winner. It was his turn to admit defeat, but Count Nicholas forced himself to get up.</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>Blood was flowing down from his arm. His whole body wouldn’t listen to him, and he gritted his teeth as he raised his sword.</p>
<p>“… continue.”</p>
<p>His voice cracked.</p>
<p>The willingness to accept the victor was said to be a virtue of a swordsman, but Count Nicholas couldn’t accept the reality, even if he looked miserable because he carried the royal family on his shoulders.</p>
<p>He accepted the fact that he was defeated, but he couldn’t kneel when the thought of the royal family being harmed in the future hit him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure what to do. He had already lost his role as a supporter by showing his weakness here, but in his sixty years of life, he had done nothing but be consistent with the sword. So fighting until the end was the best thing he could do.</p>
<p>He forced his heavy, drooping eyes to open, and he pushed himself up to regain the senses in his dull body.</p>
<p>“Why are you doing this?”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry asked.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas’s attack was truly terrifying. He was able to win because of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art’s middle form, but Count Nicholas was by far the best he had ever fought.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t met Butler and if he hadn’t had a year of imaginary training then Roman Dmitry wouldn’t have been safe going against the roaring flame.</p>
<p>And finally, the winner was him. Breaking through the flames, he stepped on the greatest sword of Cairo.</p>
<p>The Count smiled.</p>
<p>“… why would you ask that? Isn’t it natural? I am the First Sword of Cairo, and even though I have fallen down, my will hasn’t broken yet.”</p>
<p>His voice kept losing its tone. His defeat wasn’t pretty. Count Nicholas was stained in blood and unlike his name, he looked pitiful.</p>
<p>But what could be done? If his sword was broken, he, who wanted to show his will, was also broken.</p>
<p>“Enough.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He kicked the ground but his movement was slow. As he ran, blood was dripping on the ground and it looked like he would collapse anytime.</p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>‘Richard Nicholas.’</p>
<p>The light of Cairo was such a wonderful man. He would not kill him, however, the times were changing and he wasn’t going to show him mercy.</p>
<p>Roman sent him a message. At the words Roman sent him through mana, the Count ran to Roman with wide eyes.</p>
<p>And at that moment…..</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The sword cut right through his chest, and blood splattered. Count Nicholas’s eyes lost focus, and he collapsed as he was charging.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>The First Sword of Cairo.</p>
<p>It was the end of a giant who ruled an era.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the end of a long journey. Looking at Count Nicholas stained with blood, Willas spoke in a trembling voice,</p>
<p>“… with this, Roman Dmitry is now the number one in the Cairo Kingdom.”</p>
<p>No one cheered at the shocking results. The match was too much, as everyone stared dumbfounded at the two.</p>
<p>Willas also couldn’t hide his shock. Even as someone who genuinely enjoyed such matches, this result was too shocking.</p>
<p>‘This is absurd.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s limit was higher. The Valhalla Empire was keeping an eye on him because of his rapid growth and boundless talent. They admired the way he defeated Cairo’s rankers from the 99th to the 2nd.</p>
<p>They had no choice but to admit Roman’s skills, but they didn’t think he could defeat Count Nicholas. According to the information from Valhalla, the Count was stronger than he was five years ago. And no matter how much Roman Dmitry tried, it would be impossible to catch up with him.</p>
<p>But Roman won with overwhelming strength.</p>
<p>Even when Willas witnessed the head-to-head fight unfold, he was not sure what had happened, but that the match just ended.</p>
<p>‘Did we underestimate Roman Dmitry? No, that’s not the problem. No matter how much we thought Roman’s limits were, the monster keeps surpassing them. Well, a monster appeared in the Cairo Kingdom. Roman Dmitry is a person who would have caused a great stir if he had been born in Valhalla.’</p>
<p>His heart pounded. Count Nicholas was someone who didn’t have a high rank in Valhalla. But Roman was someone they had to keep tabs on, especially when he was still in his mid-20s.</p>
<p>“The challenges for the Ranking Matches end now.”</p>
<p>He hastily left that place. The results? They didn’t matter anymore. It was time for him to contact his home nation since he had to relay what happened in Cairo.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is no longer a target we can leave alone. If he adheres to this attitude of not wanting to choose a side…’</p>
<p>Death. If they couldn’t have him as an ally, then Roman’s existence couldn’t be spared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the end of the fight, Roman headed to the palace. It was time to be recognized for defeating Count Nicholas and to announce that he was now the first and best sword in Cairo. But on the way to the palace, a group blocked Roman’s path.</p>
<p>“… Roman Dmitry. I never thought you would defeat Count Nicholas.”</p>
<p>It was Marquis Benedict. He and the nobles appeared in groups. Troops from each allied family filled the streets and even normal people hid at this force.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was unusual. Marquis Benedict who used to gaze at Roman with loving eyes was now showing a cold face.</p>
<p>“As I watched Count Nicholas collapse, I had a complicated thought. Was I stupid for not expecting it, or have you been hiding your power on purpose all this time? And I thought it was the latter.”</p>
<p>For now, Marquis Benedict believed he could still control Roman Dmitry. Roman’s power wasn’t that great, so even after giving him a year, he didn’t worry much about him.</p>
<p>But as a result, Count Nicholas collapsed. In addition, the Dmitry family formed a coalition in the northeast, and Roman Dmitry proved to be stronger than Count Nicholas whom the nobles were wary of.</p>
<p>This was simply not an acceptable result. What he believed he could control was only revealing his power now. This was flustering.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a fox. He didn’t know if this was true but he didn’t think Roman was the type to make such a joke.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry didn’t need a year to prepare himself. With the justification to prepare for the Public Ranking, he must have used that time to reorganize the Dmitry family. Roman Dmitry had known he could handle me from the beginning. Even so, I firmly believed that Roman Dmitry had no choice but to follow my words. And thinking that he is just a fool from the outskirts was my mistake.’</p>
<p>It was different now that Roman Dmitry gained strength. It would no longer be impossible for Roman to oppose them if he put his mind to it.</p>
<p>And because of that, he called for the troops of their faction. Even if Cairo was under the rule of the royal family, the guards would still open the gates for them.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“One year ago. You said you would choose after the rankings are over. Tell us your choice now. Will you follow me and the nobles or make a different choice? If you chose the former I will accept you but if it is the latter, you will have to pay for what you have received from me.”</p>
<p>The moments of acceptance returned with malice.</p>
<p>And Marquis Benedict continued in a determined voice,</p>
<p>“Choose. What is your decision?”</p>
<p>The moment to make a choice has finally arrived.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was the same in Baek Joong-hyuk’s life. As he struggled to live at one point, he had to make a choice.</p>
<p>“Joong-hyuk. I will become the leader of the Heavenly Demon Sect. I have always treated you as my brother. But from now on, your choice will determine our relationship, so you need to choose. Will you enjoy wealth and honor by my side for the rest of your life or will you choose to be my enemy until the end?”</p>
<p>On that day, Baek Ho-yeol, the Great Young Lord of the sect, appeared with a power capable to stain the ground as dark as the night sky.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t a matter of making a simple choice. With Baek Joong-hyuk proving his worth and being discussed as the successor to the new position of Heavenly Demon, Baek Ho-yeol wouldn’t allow Baek Joong-hyuk to grow. And there were their other brothers too.</p>
<p>At first, the people who were fighting for the same position made the choice to surrender to Baek Ho-yeol.</p>
<p>‘What is the choice for me?’</p>
<p>His life was full of struggles and every second was hell. He could never sleep peacefully and many of those who followed him were killed because they were loyal to him.</p>
<p>Every time he struggled, he remembered the words and actions of the people who looked at him and he cursed his fate, wanting to end it all.</p>
<p>But the moment he would hold Baek Ho-yeol’s hand, life would be convenient. He wouldn’t have to struggle, and he’d be able to sleep without worrying about people trying to kill him. But….</p>
<p>“Hyung. I am sorry but I am a person who cannot live for others.”</p>
<p>When he was at the bottom position, Baek Joong-hyuk started his struggle by smashing the head of a boy with a stone.</p>
<p>Kill, kill, kill, and more killing.</p>
<p>If anyone looked down on him, tried to rise higher than him, or even tried to look at him, he would hurt them and emerge as the winner.</p>
<p>His nature would never change. The beast which had tasted blood couldn’t bow its head even if it meant death.</p>
<p>Baek Ho-yeol had a cold expression on his face. And as he took a step back, his men rushed for Baek Joong-hyuk.</p>
<p>On a night with a full moon, Baek Joong-hyuk was drenched in blood. Despite quenching his thirst with blood, the shadow of death was close by.</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk slashed the enemies who rushed at him.</p>
<p>Finally, as Baek Ho-yeol looked up at him with a shocked look on his face, Baek Joon-hyuk cut his head off.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>And now….</p>
<p>“I get what you mean.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry looked at Marquis Benedict and the people behind him. This situation reminded him so much about his previous life and this made him smile.</p>
<p>“But you see. I don’t think I can live for others. That is my choice.”</p>
<p>At those words, Marquis Benedict’s expression twisted horribly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 170 - Purge (1)</p>
<p>As expected, Roman Dmitry had no intention of swearing his allegiance from the start. The doubts started when he spoke about declaring his choice after the Ranking Matches.</p>
<p>“Stupid brat.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict smiled.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry, the new number one ranker, was strong. But even though he was qualified to lead Cairo’s new future, he made a fatal mistake by being intoxicated with his victory. The land he was in now was Cairos. And if he had hidden in the Dmitry estate, then they might not have had the chance to attack him, but he opened up Pandora’s box.</p>
<p><em>Clack! Clack!</em></p>
<p>The nobles’ troops surrounded the area and the sound of iron moving could be heard.</p>
<p>Breaking the silence, Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“From now on, I speak in the name of the head of the Central Government, Marquis Benedict. In the past few years, the Dmitry family has shown a pattern of indiscriminately attacking the troops in the surrounding areas, including the Barco and the Douglas family. Cairo is in a warring state and a civil war is forbidden in a situation where foreign troops might invade it anytime, yet for the sake of their own power, the Dmitry family committed such an unforgivable act. Therefore, in order to ensure a post-war investigation into this matter, I will arrest Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>His voice boomed.</p>
<p>Barco and Douglas were trampled on by Roman. There were no problems with the process.</p>
<p>Barco had a fight with Lawrence, and Roman, who was somehow involved because of his betrothal, had a reason to help them, and Douglas was no different.</p>
<p>As Douglas brought the families from the north, the strife escalated, and the Dmitry family, a powerful family in the northeast, couldn’t stand still.</p>
<p>As the saying goes, if you wear it on your nose, it is a nose ring, and if you wear it on your ears, it is an earring. [TL/N: A Korean saying that means things are how we interpret them to be.] It was just a play on words.</p>
<p>In reality, there was no problem, but Marquis Benedict used trivial excuses to arrest Roman.</p>
<p>“The Central Government is an organization that obeys the orders of His Majesty, the King. The rule on rebellion was violated according to His Majesty’s will, and so the Dmitry family will be punished for it. So go ahead and take him. If you cooperate with the investigation, you can prove that the Dmitry family is not guilty.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict laughed. As the strongest living power, the Central Government could suppress Roman with just words. No matter how strong Roman Dmitry was, this wasn’t something he could get away with, and responding meekly was all he could do.</p>
<p>The Marquis would make sure to cut Roman down so he couldn’t go on a rampage later. But if he didn’t respond nicely to this arrest, it would no longer be a fight between him and the Dmitry family but a fight against the power structure of Cairo and Dmitry.</p>
<p>This was a clever attempt. Marquis Benedict used his power to show a reality that Roman Dmitry couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>‘You should have just listened to me. If you had held my hand, you would have been able to live your life with a powerful person in Cairo and hold power, but from the moment you chose the middle ground, you were not allowed to live. Roman Dmitry, you surely are an existence with too many needs. Before you even return to Dmitry and establish a force of your own, the power you hold will be destroyed so you can never oppose me.’</p>
<p>It was a straightforward decision. They went after Roman Dmitry when he was weak after defeating Count Nicholas. But if he had sworn allegiance, maybe Marquis Benedict would have just tried to capture him.</p>
<p>Being the leader of the nobles was Marquis Benedict’s true face. And without his brutal and daring executions, the nobles would have never gotten such a hold in Cairo.</p>
<p><em>Glance.</em></p>
<p>He focused on the noble troops that approached Roman. Now that they have tied the hands and feet of Roman Dmitry, they are sure he is going to bow down. But…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>“This bastard!”</p>
<p>Blood splattered. A knight staggered and collapsed. Roman Dmitry proudly cut down Marquis Benedict’s knight.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s expression stiffened. No, he didn’t even think he would choose to protest. Rebellion was a road of ruin for Dmitry. And above all, the nobles mobilized their best troops, so Roman Dmitry chose the worst option.</p>
<p>“… are you going to rebel?”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll make myself clear. Marquis Benedict, it’s not a rebellion against the King, but one against you.”</p>
<p>Roman smiled. Shaking the blood off his sword, he looked around.</p>
<p>“Cairos is the land of the King. Unless the nation is in danger of ruin, the soldiers from the nobles’ families cannot send troops that exceed a certain number to Cairos for any cause. But to me, it seems like you have exceeded the number. Marquis Benedict, could it be that you are the one intending to rebel?”</p>
<p>“You cheeky bastard!”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s face turned red. How dare he? He didn’t think that his plan of rebellion would be used against him. Not only did he use words indicating he was the enemy, but he also cut his own men down, yet Marquis Benedict cannot show his anger now. His name was trampled on and whoever wins, one of them should see the end.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“The Central Government is the center of Cairo. That is why it is called the Central Government and all our decisions reflect those of the King. And what? We are planning a rebellion? Hahaha! You are mad enough to deny yours. You cut down the servant who obeys the orders of the King. This is a rebellion, and Dmitry will perish due to your actions.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Punish the traitor!”</p>
<p>The nobles raised their voices, and the situation changed as they were sure of their win. A battle within Cairos would ensue, and Roman would be outnumbered.</p>
<p>But he had already expected it. Roman knew from the moment Marquis Benedict blocked his path that a fight would happen.</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict. It is up to His Majesty to decide who is right. Therefore, from now on, I intend to dispose of the trash in Cairo that plotted the rebellion. After everything is sorted out, I will be judged by the King of Cairo directly and not by the ones who mocked the will of the royal family.”</p>
<p>He moved the same way as his opponent.</p>
<p>Staring at Marquis Benedict who looked shocked, Roman said,</p>
<p>“Chris. Kevin, open up the path.”</p>
<p>At those words, the two swordsmen, who were waiting for his order, rushed forward.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At a glance, there were more than a few hundred troops. And even though they had filled up the streets, Chris and Kevin rushed ahead at the same time as if they were waiting.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“Stop them… <em>Kuak!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>It all started with Kevin. Kevin threw himself onto the opponents and decapitated the knight who was taking the lead. The knight kneeled down with blood spurting, and Kevin moved to slaughter the others.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The knights began to raise their auras and collectively attacked Kevin, but he was now an animal moving on instinct. And….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The enemies continued to die. The screams continued, and Kevin brutally slaughtered the men moving towards him as if he were just doing regular training. It was overwhelming to look at.</p>
<p>If Kevin handled the enemies like a demon soaked in blood, then Chris, who moved later, was like a solid wall.</p>
<p><em>Crush!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>The enemy was split in two with his sword. Chris was not in a hurry. There were plenty of enemies to deal with. The nobles’ forces were still under the illusion that they had the advantage, and now their bodies were piling up against Chris.</p>
<p>Even normal soldiers without aura died, and the enemies who faced Chris collapsed with blood splashing. He didn’t make any special moves, but just after exchanging a couple of clashes, all his opponents would look stained with shock.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>A knight of the noble family fell down. Although he had some reputation as an aura swordsman, he couldn’t withstand three hits against Chris. And…</p>
<p>“Cover Chris and Kevin.”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>His other men also started to attack. When Roman went to the capital, he didn’t bring many troops. He just brought twenty, including Chris and Kevin, but as the two moved first, the others rushed in to attack the opponents.</p>
<p>As Pooky and Volcan attacked the enemies by tearing off their limbs, Henderson and McBurney were calmly taking them down. They had no strategy for dealing with their opponents. They just ran ahead and made a path by making sure no one under Roman was hurt.</p>
<p>Last year, Roman took his time. He did not only focus on strengthening himself. He also prepared his people for future chaos. And this was the result. Roman’s men were slaughtering hundreds of enemies.</p>
<p>And the path was now open. The troops of the nobles rushed to block them, but with the corpses piling up, there was now a gap.</p>
<p>And between them….</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman walked forward.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict was in the front.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry stepped on the corpses and the puddles of blood and moved to his target.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“… t-these fucking insane bastards.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s expression turned pale. His eyes were spinning. He couldn’t comprehend the scene unfolding before his eyes.</p>
<p>‘How dare he attack the nobles of Cairo.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a madman. Attacking the nobles was no different from a rebellion, but he still did it even though he was aware of it.</p>
<p>“What should we do now?!”</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict!”</p>
<p>The nobles were all fear-struck. The atmosphere was strange. Hundreds of troops that were supposed to overwhelm one man and had the numerical advantage were being slaughtered one-sidedly by Roman.</p>
<p>Time was on the nobles’ side. If they could hold out, the guards of Cairo would arrive and attack the traitors, but the fight, which should have been slow, was moving at breakneck speed.</p>
<p>The path was open, and now Roman was walking towards them. Fear began to grip the heart of Marquis Benedict.</p>
<p>‘I was wrong. If I cannot suppress Roman Dmitry with rebellion, then it would be best to avoid him.’</p>
<p>His opponent was Roman Dmitry, who defeated Count Nicholas. There was no way they could defeat him in such small fights. And the power of the nobles was all about their mighty troops.</p>
<p>But once they would step back and make a new plan, they could trample on Roman Dmitry. No matter how much power they had, how could a single noble family withstand such an attack?</p>
<p>They had to take one step back for now and two steps forward later. So Marquis Benedict stepped back.</p>
<p>But even so, he shouted,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, you heinous traitor! Risk your lives and bring me the rebels! Regardless of status, anyone who brings his head will be promised a great future!”</p>
<p>“Everyone! Attack!”</p>
<p>The nobles shouted, and then they ran away, pushing their soldiers forward, while the nobles ran in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>The soldiers were left on their own, and they knew how dangerous it was. However, they had to follow the orders they were given and act, even though they knew they would die.</p>
<p>“S-Stop!”</p>
<p>“This is Cairos! Do you think you can do this?”</p>
<p>The nobles’ troops blocked the path even as they were trembling in fear. They didn’t want to collapse now. They still seemed to believe that following the nobles was the right decision, and they tried to block Roman’s footsteps somehow while screaming threats.</p>
<p>In any case, disobeying their orders meant death. And if they were going to die either way, then it would be better to die fighting than be labeled as traitors.</p>
<p>Roman didn’t stop walking.</p>
<p>Right. He wasn’t in a hurry either. He ignored the nobles who began to flee and turned his attention to the soldiers in front of him.</p>
<p>“You have to do what you have to do. I, too, will do what I have to do.”</p>
<p>He raised his sword. It was now time to purge everything.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 171 - Purge (2)</p>
<p><em>“E-Eik!”</em></p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>Their fear has now reached the breaking point. The soldiers who were shouting and threatening Roman eventually chose to attack him first because the threats weren’t working.</p>
<p>The aura swordsmen rushed ahead. With dozens of people attacking together, they were under the delusion that they could defeat Roman Dmitry. And so…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The massacre began. Roman’s sword could be seen flashing, and the heads of the aura swordsmen flew in the air. Blood gushed out like a fountain everywhere. The soldiers tried to step back in fear, but Roman followed them right away and cut them down.</p>
<p>The whole place was mixed with bright red blood and deafening screams. Because they followed the nobles, they couldn’t avoid the devil, who was right in front of them.</p>
<p>“… Cairo’s Devil!”</p>
<p>“ACCK!”</p>
<p>The Hector Kingdom referred to Roman Dmitry as Cairo’s Devil on the Southern Front. The people of Cairo thought of it as an achievement that they called him that, but standing on the other side, they could see why he was called the devil.</p>
<p>It was truly overwhelming. As if proving the fact that he was the new number one ranker in Cairo, the aura swordsmen were all dying in vain, unable to attack.</p>
<p><em>Blood, blood, blood.</em></p>
<p>And the path opened. In the situation that was dotted red, there was no way to stop Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Actually, the power of the nobles wasn’t weak. But they made the mistake of using their power like this.</p>
<p>‘Marquis Benedict, you will fall into the abyss if you decide to hold onto your attachment to me until the very end.’</p>
<p>While challenging the Ranking Matches, Roman Dmitry rendered his opponents useless. People thought it was simply the price of the Ranking Matches, but Roman Dmitry expected a clash with the nobles too.</p>
<p>If he had killed Jayden, the 99th ranker, the nobles would have reacted negatively and sent their swordsmen, but he didn’t. However, if they step away from fighting Roman because of his strength, then people would consider him the strongest. And that was their mistake.</p>
<p>The core forces, including Oscar, all fought against him, yet they all collapsed without being able to stand. In particular, in Oscar’s case, whom he dealt with at the end, he deliberately used mana to destroy the path of his aura. And Marquis Benedict might not have been aware of this.</p>
<p>Roman’s most powerful sword would not simply render a body useless for a certain time, but it would end the life of a swordsman.</p>
<p>From the start until now, Roman Dmitry has been preparing for the clash against the nobles. Marquis Benedict judged the timing to be perfect, but the truth was that he was sticking his head into the jaws of a beast.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Knights stumbled and fell around him. The soldiers of the nobles couldn’t even bring themselves to run. They didn’t know if they even had a slight chance to win, so they didn’t rush into this meaningless death anymore.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman passed them and walked forward. Without even paying attention to the soldiers who were trembling in his presence, he just followed Marquis Benedict’s traces while holding his sword which was dripping with blood.</p>
<p>The soldiers just looked away because, if they didn’t, they wouldn’t have the confidence to accept this reality.</p>
<p>Roman moved slowly so his opponent could run away far enough. He headed in the direction where Marquis Benedict had disappeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The strongest living power in Cairo, Marquis Benedict, who didn’t even rush to meet the King, was now running with sweat over his face.</p>
<p>‘Fleeing to the palace is not a wise decision. If Roman Dmitry had planned a conspiracy with the King, I could possibly be executed without any resistance. So let’s head back to the estate. If I gather the troops there, I might be able to fully change this situation.’</p>
<p>That was the best decision. And Marquis Benedict was out of breath. The expensive jewelry on his body was falling to the ground, but he didn’t even look back at it.</p>
<p>And the nobles who were on his side were running after him. It was a rare sight to see such influential men running in a group.</p>
<p>Finally, Marquis Benedict arrived near the warp gate.</p>
<p>“<em>Ack, ack.</em> Connect the coordinates to my estate right now!”</p>
<p>“What happene….”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>There was no time to explain, so he slapped the soldier’s cheek.</p>
<p>“You bastard! Do you not know who I am?! If you have the time to question me, then hurry up and connect the coordinates to the Benedict Estate! If you are even a little late, I swear I will destroy the succeeding three generations of your family!”</p>
<p>“I-I understand!”</p>
<p>All of the soldiers turned pale at the threat and hurriedly connected the warp device. Everyone involved came out and activated the function of the warp gate. It was because only a few personnel were around and they had to do it fast.</p>
<p>The warp gate was known to take a lot of time, but they were able to finish it due to Marquis Benedict’s request. But the problem was that they couldn’t accommodate all the nobles around him.</p>
<p>When Marquis Benedict climbed the warp gate first, they followed him on board.</p>
<p>“You people, follow next!”</p>
<p>“Marquis!”</p>
<p>The faces of the nobles were pale. Warp gates had delays when functioning. It was impossible for all of them to escape now, and they would have to wait for the next turn, and the second usage would take a lot of time. But….</p>
<p><em>Wheik—</em></p>
<p>Marquis Benedict turned away from their earnest eyes.</p>
<p>A bright light shone, and then he disappeared.</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>“Fucking bastard!”</p>
<p>The nobles cursed. Being the head of the nobles’ faction didn’t matter now. And so the nobles tried to run on foot, but then they went stiff.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry appeared.</p>
<p>Seeing him holding his blood-stained sword, one of the nobles said,</p>
<p>“… you, please be calm. If you kill all of us, what will you even get? I will die right here, but my family will do everything to get revenge on you. So let me live. If you do that, I will leave the nobles’ faction and follow the Dmitry family right this moment.”</p>
<p>In a desperate voice, the man kneeled down and acted as if he was giving up everything. And so did the others. Now that their escort troops were dead, it was best for them to beg for their lives.</p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“It is too late.”</p>
<p>The people who were here were those who appeared before him and planned on killing him. It was unknown what the situation would have been like had they maintained a passive stance, but they crossed a line they shouldn’t have.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>He grabbed a noble by the head. There was no way for him to resist. The noble struggled, but he couldn’t do much against Roman.</p>
<p>Roman continued to grab his head as he looked at the others.</p>
<p>“If you drew the sword, shouldn’t you pay the price?”</p>
<p>And he cut his throat.</p>
<p>With the squeal of a pig, blood dripped down. And witnessing that made the nobles who were kneeling down pee themselves.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Cairo Royal Palace was in an uproar at the same time.</p>
<p>“A battle just broke out in the middle of the capital. It is presumed that Marquis Benedict, along with the nobles’ faction, is fighting against Roman Dmitry, and Roman Dmitry is reported to be massacring the nobles!”</p>
<p>“…W-What!”</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo was shocked. A massacre? It was unusual. Aside from the battle in the capital, he didn’t expect Roman Dmitry to draw his sword against Cairo’s most powerful man, Marquis Benedict.</p>
<p>He instantly felt an ominous feeling arise. A battle in the capital meant…</p>
<p>‘A rebellion?’</p>
<p>Maybe… maybe today was D-Day.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry defeated Count Nicholas. Because of the challenge for the Ranking Matches, Count Nicholas had to go alone, and the weapon of the royal’s faction collapsed like that. That only meant that the King was now a powerless man. If Roman Dmitry barges into the palace with ill intent, the rebellion will succeed.</p>
<p>The lieutenant of the Royal Knights, shouted with his neck turning red,</p>
<p>“Call the Royal Knights and the guards right now! We never know when the traitors will step into the palace! From now on, the safety of His Majesty will be our top priority!’</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The soldiers moved in order, with the palace in chaos. At the sudden rebellion, Daniel Cairo tried to breathe.</p>
<p>‘… could this be an unavoidable end?’</p>
<p>He knew that a rebellion would happen at some point. The King’s faction only held power with Count Nicholas by their side, and they didn’t have enough power to suppress the others. They were relying on one person until now.</p>
<p>Like a candle in a stormy night, if any faction revolted, he would be immediately deprived of the throne. It was a foreseeable future.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo’s heart was racing like crazy, but he tried to accept this situation calmly. And right then…</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! Roman Dmitry has arrived at the palace!”</p>
<p>The leader of the rebellion finally arrived.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The air was tense. The people in the royal family had expectations. They thought the Roman Dmitry would soon start a massacre as soon as he arrived, but he meekly followed the rules in the palace.</p>
<p>“Disarm!”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He took off his armor and put down his weapons.</p>
<p>The Royal Knights, who were hostile, guided him on the orders of the King. They didn’t let their guard down in the slightest. They were all aiming their swords, ready to attack Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman stopped and looked at Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>“I greet His Majesty, the King.”</p>
<p>“… let’s skip the troublesome process. I heard that there was an incident in the capital. Explain the entire thing.”</p>
<p>He immediately went to the main point. Be it a rebellion or not, Cairo was an important place for the royal family.</p>
<p>In the situation where people’s eyes were focused on him, Roman said with a blood-stained face,</p>
<p>“The situation started with Marquis Benedict’s demands. Right after the match ended, he came with his troops and urged me to follow the nobles’ faction. At that time, there were hundreds of troops blocking me, and it was clearly against the laws of Cairo, and I was considered a traitor for refusing his offer. It was unfair. Cairo follows His Majesty and not Marquis Benedict, so I couldn’t obey him.”</p>
<p>His voice was strong.</p>
<p>And as he expressed such strong emotions, he looked right at the King,</p>
<p>“And then blood was spilled. Even though I knew it was a problem, I couldn’t just kneel.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere turned cold.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, Roman broke the rule in Cairo. They understood his justification, but the people of the royal faction couldn’t make a decision on how to respond.</p>
<p>And his words weren’t over. Roman revealed his reason for coming to the palace.</p>
<p>“From now on, I would like to make a proposal to His Majesty. If you can promise me what I want, as the sword of Cairo, the Dmitry family will suffocate the lives of the nobles and set Cairo’s chaotic power system in order.”</p>
<p>At those words, the people were shocked. The clash between Dmitry and the nobles was bringing an unexpected scenario for the royal faction.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 172 - Purge (3)</p>
<p>Roman’s proposal was unusual. Despite claiming to be the sword of Cairo, Roman Dmitry was offering a deal rather than loyalty to the royal family.</p>
<p>And so, Daniel Cairo wasn’t sure how to respond. He had always hoped that the nobles would collapse for the power struggle to stop, but he was afraid of what kind of price he would be asked for.</p>
<p>It was an expected reaction. Breaking through the silence, Roman said,</p>
<p>“When the Hector Kingdom crossed the border, he was on the Southern Front. The complacent defense system couldn’t stop the intentions of the Hector Kingdom, and the warp gate fell into the hands of the enemy without any resistance. At that time, do you know what I was thinking? While hiding in the mountains with the troops, I resented the Cairo family for not responding quickly. Although the defense was weak, if we had faced danger and learned to react quickly, the entire Southern Front wouldn’t have been taken.”</p>
<p>He rebuked their actions. Whether or not people showed a hint of response, he pointed out the fault of the royal family.</p>
<p>“I learned about the problems in the power system through what had happened. But has anything changed? No. Whenever Kronos makes a threatening move on the Western Front, the royal family just holds a meeting and watches the situation until the Central Government gives their approval. That is really horrible. Even though you know the issue, you just ultimately choose to stand by.”</p>
<p>The four factions were the problem in Cairo. Their relationship was like a magic bomb that couldn’t be touched, so the experience on the Southern Front didn’t fix it.</p>
<p>“Currently, the situation on the Salamander Continent is not serious. In a situation where war is on the verge of breaking out, if the Kronos Empire crosses the border, Cairo will not survive. Knowing that fact, how long will you just stand by? Someone has to wield the power. We need to unite the nation so that we have a systematic structure to deal with the events of the future. And I think it is right for Your Majesty to do it. Being the King, it is right for Your Majesty to hold the center and not Marquis Benedict, who speaks only for the nobles and pretends to be the King.”</p>
<p>His strong voice made the eyes of the people shake. Roman’s words about the King being the head made their hearts beat.</p>
<p>“I attacked Marquis Benedict for forcing me to make a choice. As Your Majesty, the King, you might doubt my intentions, but I want you to know that Dmitry just took a risky chance. The Dmitry family risked our lives and did this. And if Your Majesty ignores the chance we took, then the entire estate will have to face the consequences. Are you willing to stay on the sidelines until then? Or will you take advantage of the situation that Dmitry has given you?”</p>
<p>He passed over the decision to the King.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo who had been silent for a long time, asked,</p>
<p>“I have a question before I make my decision. In return for what you did, what does the Dmitry family want?”</p>
<p>It was important for him to know the promise Roman was talking about.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In his new life, what was his goal? Roman Dmitry wanted to rise to the peak, but that didn’t mean he was going to engulf Cairo to make his own empire.</p>
<p>For the goal that Roman wanted, Dmitry was enough. In order to control a huge land, there was no need to trample on the existing culture and traditions and tread on the path of slaughter.</p>
<p>In his past life, Baek Joong-hyuk’s conquest of Murim and his rise as the Heavenly Demon were different from this. If the beings who once commanded Murim wanted to take over Murim, then what Baek Joong-hyuk did was a mental submission.</p>
<p>The Forces of Justice, the Forces of Evil, and the others, continued their way of life like before, but when asked who was the one above Murim, then they would speak of Baek Joong-hyuk. He destroyed all the forces that tried to stop his conquest. And then he returned to the Hundred Thousand Mountains.</p>
<p>But rather than attempting to control a vast expanse of land, he made the people aware that Murim was a place under his complete control, and everyone had no choice but to support him. And from then on, Baek Joong-hyuk became a sanctuary.</p>
<p>The forces of Murim continued to fight each other, but they never dared to get close to Baek Joong-hyuk. And as such, Murim had achieved the age of peace and prosperity.</p>
<p>If one looked at history, Murim always faced a crisis due to the beings that had dangerous thoughts. However, when Baek Joong-hyuk was alive, he held a certain role, as he became the center for making people abandon any potentially dangerous thoughts they might be having.</p>
<p>And that was the Murim of Baek Joong-hyuk. It wasn’t an empire in the sense that he was exploiting people and receiving things from them, but it was a firm domination that perfectly lingered over the minds of the people.</p>
<p>And the life of Roman Dmitry wasn’t so different. Roman wanted to rise to the top, but it was different from how the Kronos Empire wanted to conquer lands and the continent.</p>
<p>‘I will be the Heavenly Demon in Dmitry. I do not wish for destruction as I rise to the top. The forces standing in my path will certainly be trampled on only when necessary. Cairo or anyone else will have to acknowledge my existence. And when everyone finally recognizes Dmitry as the best in the continent, I will return to Dmitry and find my own peace.’</p>
<p>He had a clear goal in mind. And now, in response to Daniel Cairo’s question, Roman Dmitry has revealed his purpose.</p>
<p>“I want independence in the northeastern region, including Dmitry. If Cairo’s northeastern area is recognized as a Duchy and is given the power to work independently, then Dmitry will do our best for Cairo since we have the same roots. It does not mean that we are asking to break away or become completely independent. We will move with Cairo, but we also want to build our own world.”</p>
<p>At first glance, his words sounded like a rebellion. Looking at Daniel Cairo’s shocked expression, Roman firmly drove the nail into the wall.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, my King. If you cannot do that, then make the best choice for Cairo according to you.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The atmosphere cooled down at Roman’s words. If it was the choice of the King then it was acceptable, but the King’s faction wouldn’t like their King being given an order.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. This isn’t right.”</p>
<p>“You are right. Has there ever been a case in the world where the title of ‘Duchy’ was granted at the request of someone? Dmitry intends to take care of his own interests in the name of nobility. You cannot allow it.”</p>
<p>The royalists protested.</p>
<p>Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“Yes, that is right. There is no such thing. But are there other options? While those present remain silent despite the atrocities of the nobles, I’ve drawn my sword against them. I’ve shed blood, and from now on, I need to fully bear the consequences of going against them. I only want the right price for my sacrifice. The title of ‘Duchy’ needs to be given by Cairo, and Cairo and Dmitry will forever be the same community. All I want is the strength to stand against what lies ahead. If they act complacently as they did at the Southern Front at that time, then at least we as a Duchy can provide you with a solid defense.”</p>
<p>He drew the line that it wasn’t a rebellion. Although his intentions could be seen that way, Roman Dmitry didn’t intend to make it completely clear to them. That was the deal. If the northeast would fall apart, he knew he couldn’t just give positive hope to Cairo.</p>
<p>Finally, the choice was up to the King. As he fixed his gaze on him, Daniel Cairo was lost in thought.</p>
<p>‘What do you mean by this?’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. Even though he was surrounded by soldiers with weapons, he didn’t look scared. Rather, he was looking confident. But it wasn’t arrogance. Even if he gave the order to attack Roman, the Royal Knights couldn’t subdue him. From the moment he defeated Count Nicholas, Roman was an uncontrollable monster in Cairo.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry’s suggestion isn’t that wrong. I just watched and was unable to do anything as the power system in Cairo was being torn down. If it weren’t for Dmitry, I wouldn’t have even thought of fighting the nobles. However, if the Cairo royal family insists on our rights without a sacrifice, Dmitry will have a different line of thought from then on. Right after Dmitry defeats the nobles, they will not think much about rebellion. And if they have the power and justification, it will be enough. And knowing all of this, Roman Dmitry is giving me a chance to stand beside him.’</p>
<p>He faced the reality. Daniel Cairo was called a weak King, but he wasn’t an idiot who didn’t know the reality. The royal family had no power. And if he borrowed power from Dmitry to correct the mess in the kingdom, it wouldn’t be a bad thing.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry started something that the Cairo royal family couldn’t even dare to do. That alone puts Dmitry completely beyond Cairo’s control. And we need to choose now. Will we be content with the current power holders or will we give what we cannot have and bring Cairo into a new direction?’</p>
<p>He had already made the choice. The more he thought about it, the more he realized that he didn’t need to think about it for long.</p>
<p>‘I always wanted to build my own kingdom. Even if Roman Dmitry has other intentions, it cannot be worse than losing my life after being swayed by the nobles who used me as a puppet. At least, Roman Dmitry spoke his honest thoughts. If that is the case, it would be best to make positive ties with Dmitry who has a clear path.’</p>
<p>He knew that this decision was a risky one. If he believed in Dmitry and worked with him, then he might die one fine day. But he was convinced after watching Roman. He believed that this man would surely finish what he had failed to do.</p>
<p>“I promise to you on the honor of the Cairo Royal family that if this issue is cleared, I will declare the northeastern area, including the Dmitry, as a Duchy and give the title of Duke to Baron Dmitry. So all you need to do is win. And be sure to punish Marquis Benedict, the traitor who disturbed the nation.”</p>
<p>The command was given.</p>
<p>It was the moment the puppet King finally made his own decision.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The nation had turned into a mess from the clash between the nobles and Dmitry. Count Denver, who sided with Valhalla, watched this from his home.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. What a scary guy.”</p>
<p>A series of surprises. He couldn’t hide his surprise that Roman was able to defeat Count Nicholas, but then he went straight for Marquis Benedict’s faction.</p>
<p>It was a situation with too many variables. Even if Roman Dmitry was able to defeat Count Nicholas, he never thought he would clash with the nobles.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry made the choice. Rather than choosing a side and relying on them, he intends to create an independent faction for the Dmitry Alliance. And as long as they are attacked by Marquis Benedict in the capital, Dmitry and the nobles cannot stop fighting until one side dies.’</p>
<p><em>Kiik.</em></p>
<p>He leaned back in his chair as he chuckled. Things were taking an extreme turn, but that wasn’t too bad for Valhalla.</p>
<p>‘According to the reports, Roman Dmitry went to the palace. I am not sure if the King had planned this in advance, but it can be interpreted as the King helping out Roman to fight the nobles. A confrontation between the King, Dmitry, and the nobles—it will be a fight worth seeing. After two sides fight to the death, then I will bring Valhalla to the scene to take advantage of it.’</p>
<p>The only risk factor was Gregory. He must be thinking the same thing as him, so the Kronos Empire must also be waiting for their chance.</p>
<p>He was excited. The Cairo Kingdom was in ruins. Rather than sacrificing his life for the kingdom he was in, he hoped to quickly dedicate it to the empire and receive a high-ranking position.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>“Lord! We have trouble!”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>It was a family knight.</p>
<p>As Count Denver frowned, the knight said,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry stormed the mansion with his troops. The atmosphere is not too good. We need to run… <em>kuak!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The body of the knight was thrown to the side.</p>
<p>And behind the door, a man appeared.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry slowly walked inside and looked at Count Denver, who was seated.</p>
<p>“Count Denver. From now on, you shall follow the command of the King.”</p>
<p>Count Denver was shocked.</p>
<p>At the start of his work, Roman Dmitry first chose to remove the wrong plants within the discord.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 173 - Purge (4)</p>
<p><em>Chak. Chak.</em></p>
<p>The soldiers surrounded Count Denver.</p>
<p>Seeing the royal guards follow Roman’s order, Count Denver couldn’t hide his shocked expression.</p>
<p>“… ‘It is the King’s order.’ What is that even supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>He looked at him with wide eyes. Looking at this situation, Roman Dmitry said in a cold voice,</p>
<p>“Count Denver. Evidence has been found against you about your liaising information with Valhalla about Cairo. To ascertain the truth of this, His Majesty has ordered your arrest, Count Denver. So accept the King’s order. If you try to do anything here, you will be judged for plotting rebellion and will be punished.”</p>
<p>“R-Rebellion!”</p>
<p>Count Denver was taken aback by those words.</p>
<p>Rebellion? It took his breath away. He knew things were unusual the moment he saw Roman Dmitry arrive, but he didn’t think he would speak of rebellion right from the start.</p>
<p>‘This is really dangerous. Everyone knows that I follow Valhalla. The royal family never even considered touching me, despite the fact that the evidence supporting it is abundant. But to arrest me right now after the clash with the nobles? The moment I comply with the King’s order, my limbs will be bound.’</p>
<p>His instincts were warning him not to follow him. He could respond to any situation without regard for the royal family, but if he, the head of the Valhalla faction, was taken away, he was likely to be held responsible for everything.</p>
<p>In an instant, his head began to work like a calculator. His skinny mouth couldn’t hide the nervousness he was feeling, but Count Denver reacted as calmly as he could.</p>
<p>“Y-You people! Do you realize what you are doing?”</p>
<p>He raised his voice to intentionally come out as angry to the royal guards.</p>
<p>“It is an open fact that I communicate with the Valhalla Empire. How dare you arrest me by calling this the King’s order! Go back and ask His Majesty if he can handle the aftereffects of this! If you attack me, Valhalla will not stand still.”</p>
<p>He was in the land of the enemy, so excuses would not work. So he needed to use any weapon he could. The reason why Count Denver was able to establish power in Cairo was all thanks to the name of Valhalla.</p>
<p>The soldiers were shocked.</p>
<p>But unlike them, who looked at each other, Roman didn’t waver.</p>
<p>“Count Denver. You need to be very careful of each word you speak from now on.”</p>
<p>“You!”</p>
<p>“Lower your voice. It seems like you haven’t grasped the situation yet. The Cairo royal family started a war against the nobles. Civil war is bound to happen. In a situation where our lives are at risk fighting against the nobles, you will surely be waiting for the right time to make a profit from it. Fighting is meaningless as we are simply going to overpower the nobles. The traitors who are following Valhalla and Kronos—all of you will also have to be uprooted.”</p>
<p>“… insane bastard.”</p>
<p>The threats didn’t work. Count Denver reacted as expected. It was too obvious. But he didn’t know that Valhalla would be mentioned the moment he was cornered.</p>
<p>“The fate of Cairo is at stake in this fight. Valhalla? What will they do for us? Unlike Kronos, Valhalla has separate borders, and even if they storm into Cairo with their troops, we cannot stop what we have initiated. It is a chance that will never come again. And if we lose the battle, we’ll lose everything, so we will have to pay the price. Instead of allowing more rifts to form, it would be wise to resolve everything at once for Cairo’s future.”</p>
<p><em>Glance.</em></p>
<p>The signal was given, and the royal guards approached Count Denver.</p>
<p>“Count Denver. From now on, we will have a very nice and fun time.”</p>
<p>At Roman’s words, Count Denver had no choice but to sit down on the chair.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The plans were carried out right away. At the time when Count Denver’s house was being raided, Simon, the lieutenant commander of the Royal Knights, led the force to attack Count Gregory.</p>
<p>“These bastards! Do you think you will be fine with this? Do you think it will be alright?”</p>
<p>On the order to arrest, Count Gregory rebelled. He shouted and shook the soldiers off and looked at Simon with bloodshot eyes.</p>
<p>“Simon. You know what it means to touch me. The Kronos Empire borders Cairo. If Cairo is found to have attacked me, the empire will send troops as a warning. So judge wisely. Even if you don’t do much either, I don’t know how the Kronos Empire, which is eager to conquer the continent, will react, but they will use this as a justification to move.”</p>
<p>At that moment, all the soldiers went stiff. It was a warning they couldn’t ignore. At least Valhalla was far, but Kronos was right next to the borders.</p>
<p>‘Count Gregory is right. The Kronos Empire is not just a verbal threat to us but one which can actually attack us.’</p>
<p>It was dangerous. After stimulating a reason for Kronos to move, Cairo might be caught in a war. So Simon went into deep thought. He wasn’t sure if this was the right thing to do, but he couldn’t clear his mind of what Roman Dmitry had said to the King in the palace.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the King. You cannot look at the Kronos Empire in the same way anymore. The Kronos Empire crosses the borders of Cairo each year for no reason. Then what are you afraid of? If Kronos declares a war of conquest now, Cairo will never be able to escape it. Even if Cairo makes a decision and we get attacked by Kronos because of it, doesn’t it also happen to us each year? Then, it is much better to use this as a chance to clean up this land and their control over us. This is the only way for Cairo to survive in the future.”</p>
<p>Right. Because they always looked at Kronos, they never cared for Cairo. They occasionally crossed the borders, and Cairo’s soldiers were killed.</p>
<p>And during those times, what did Count Gregory do? He didn’t care. Even though the people of Kronos were slaughtering the people of Cairo, the land he was staying in, he continued to live like a noble.</p>
<p>His teeth clattered. Simon had colleagues who died among them, so he spent time with Count Nicholas and thought about what happened and the new reality of Cairo.</p>
<p>But a chance came. Roman Dmitry stated that he would be the one with blood on his hands in order for the others to be strong.</p>
<p>‘The Cairo Kingdom has crossed a river which we cannot go back from. If the beings that threaten the royal family are not completely cleaned out, they will come to destroy the kingdom from the inside, even before Kronos touches us. If so, sure. As Roman Dmiotry warned us, we cannot leave any variables behind.’</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. Seeing Count Gregory with a triumphant look on his face, he approached the man and pulled him by the hair. And….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>He hit his head on the ground, making Count Gregory scream. He tried to look up at Simon with a puzzled face, but Simon only pressed his head down once again.</p>
<p>“Shut up, you bastard! Anyway, you will be judged, and if Kronos crosses the border to save you, even if it is beyond my authority, I will cut off your head and hang it on a wall. So do not act out, because if you do, I will consider your actions as treason and kill you on the spot.”</p>
<p>Simon was finally letting go of his suppressed emotions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation was quickly sorted out, and both Count Gregory and Count Denver were arrested. And by issuing an alert to the borders, the soldiers began to stay alert, and the guards around the capital were keeping their eyes out. In addition, they contacted the nobles who followed the royal faction.</p>
<p>“The arrest of Count Gregory and Count Denver is a temporary measure. When the facts are checked and everything is sorted out, we will release them again.”</p>
<p>It was a necessary measure to prevent any unexpected movements from other nations. Of course, the nobles wouldn’t believe the words ‘temporary measure,’ but in fact, it wasn’t that important unless they believed it.</p>
<p>The nobles who followed the empires wouldn’t do anything unless the empires moved. No matter how much they cried out about their empires, weren’t they all still living in Cairo? And they would choose to cover their eyes and ears in a bloody civil war. The contact from the Cairo royal family would later provide them with excuses for their stay.</p>
<p>At that time, Roman Dmitry sorted things out and met with Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>“The chances of the empires moving right now are rather slim. Valhalla is far from the borders. They will have too many restrictions when sending their troops, and due to the recent dispute in the south, the Kronos Empire is a bit uneasy. Their priority isn’t Cairo. Even if we look at their troops in the south, it is more important for them to sort things out there than deal with Cairo.”</p>
<p>This plan wasn’t just about exploiting this opportunity. After assessing the situation on the continent, he decided that it was the best time to touch the nobles’ faction.</p>
<p>‘Amazing.’</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo was impressed. Roman Dmitry was such a great man. Despite the short amount of time, Roman Dmitry demonstrated bold action and incredible planning. But it was too early to be relieved by this.</p>
<p>“We are dealing with too many enemies in a short amount of time. Marquis Benedict from the nobles, Count Denver from the Valhalla faction, and Count Gregory from the Kronos faction—eliminating all of them will leave a huge vacuum in the kingdom. The Central Government was everything in Cairo. Getting rid of them is necessary for Cairo’s future, but not creating a vacuum is also essential.”</p>
<p>Cairo has been driven by the Central Government for too long. The vacancy those people would leave behind couldn’t be ignored, and it was possible that the nation would lose its function.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“We are aware of the dangers the civil war will bring us. But we only choose the best option. If the forces that divide Cairo are at their worst, then eliminating them is a risk we need to take. Because the lesser evil is what helps this nation. If we can end the civil war by eliminating the heads of each faction as quickly as possible, the confusion that Your Majesty has can be minimized to an extent.”</p>
<p>The worst scenario that he was thinking about wasn’t really the worst. And Daniel Cairo accepted that reality. Roman was right. From the moment the sword was drawn, there was no better opportunity than this for Cairo.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the Cairo royal family was moving fast, Marquis Benedict wasn’t standing still either.</p>
<p>“They are moving.”</p>
<p>Immediately after attacking him, Roman Dmitry visited the royal palace, and he heard the report that he had joined hands with the King. He was sure that he had done something he could never correct.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry showed his hostility by rejecting his proposal, and the King’s choice was to show support for Roman Dmitry’s move. Then, what was left was the war against the factions.</p>
<p>He knew that he would take the throne one day, but he didn’t think that the throne would be held this tightly.</p>
<p>“Cheeky bastard.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—he would never forgive that man. When he recalled the time he was about to attack him and his arrogance, Marquis Benedict gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>At that time, he was so pitiful. He struggled so that he could live, and he had to abandon his pride. But it was now a fight that would end with one of them dead.</p>
<p>As soon as Marquis Benedict arrived at his estate, he ordered the nobles to gather.</p>
<p>‘The nobles make up a vast majority of the power in Cairo. If we muster up enough forces from the nobles to push Cairo out of the way, even if Roman is holding hands with the King, there won’t be any problem. We need to show the consequences of trying to attack me. Right now, you might feel you are the strongest after defeating Count Nicholas but things in the world will never go your way.’</p>
<p>Within a week’s time or less, he would lead the troops and head for the capital. And the overwhelming numbers would bring him sure victory.</p>
<p>Things were going smoothly, and when the troops of the nobles were responding to his summons, he received an unexpected report.</p>
<p>“Tell me again, what was that?”</p>
<p>His voice boiled with anger. Just now, the report that the subordinate gave was very hard to comprehend.</p>
<p>And the subordinate felt scared. Frightened by Marquis Benedict’s angry tone, he spoke slowly about what he had heard.</p>
<p>“… Count Fabius. He sent an answer saying that he would not comply with the summons.”</p>
<p>It was a clear refusal. And hearing those words hurt Marquis Benedict’s heart.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 174 - Purge (5)</p>
<p>A few days ago, the nobles’ faction’s decision to attack Roman Dmitry left Count Fabius in concern.</p>
<p>“… Umm.”</p>
<p>No matter how much he thought about it, the balance just didn’t seem right. Roman Dmitry, the hero of Cairo defeated the rankers from the 99th to the top ranker, Nicholas, without even being hit once.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said that if Roman Dmitry rejected the proposal to side with him, then he would be forced to make a choice right there, but in reality, it didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>‘I experienced what Roman Dmitry was truly like on the Southern Front. Even if the nobles summoned an army-sized force, would they really be able to subdue Roman Dmitry by force? Impossible, that would never happen. Marquis Benedict thinks that right after the Ranking Matches ends, it will be his chance, but in fact, defeating Count Nicholas means that Roman Dmitry is a lot stronger than he was one year ago. The monster who defeated Butler and opened the gates of the Southern Front must have reached a level that one wouldn’t dare touch now.’</p>
<p>A year ago, Count Fabius was on the Southern Front. When the other nobles were deliberating, he himself went there and experienced what a battlefield was like.</p>
<p>Roman’s power was electrifying for him. It was great that he walked alone and defeated Butler, but the sight of him slaughtering numerous people and opening up the gates made him always think that the devil had descended into the world of humans.</p>
<p>The memories of that time were etched in his mind. Count Fabius actively insisted on recruiting Roman Dmitry, and his thoughts weren’t different now.</p>
<p>And they planned to subject Roman Dmitry to pressure? Just the thought of antagonizing him was unthinkable for Count Fabius.</p>
<p>‘The question is, if the word rebellion comes up, will Roman Dmitry just surrender? The guy never kneels to anyone. People are so sure that he will not make the decision to draw his sword in Cairos, but if he was a man running on common sense, he would have chosen to flee the Southern Front when it was captured.’</p>
<p>So it was now a matter of choice and free will. On the day of the confrontation, if the troops weren’t mobilized, he would be pushed out of the faction. And if Roman Dmitry surrendered or was defeated, then Count Fabius would have to face the consequences.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just about the collapse of his fame and name. Marquis Benedict was the type of man who drew the line, so he would surely go after Count Fabius for what he did.</p>
<p>So he had to think about what was right. It wouldn’t end with just one fight, but there’s a chance it would turn into a war between Dmitry and the nobles’ faction. Finally…</p>
<p>‘Logic cannot determine which side is correct. What is certain is that, since I served Marquis Benedict, I know the strength of the nobles, but I can’t guess Roman Dmitry’s limit or full power. And I saw firsthand on the Southern Front how terrifying Roman Dmitry is as an enemy. Fabius. Fabius. The future of my family depends on my decision.’</p>
<p>And so he decided not to send his troops. When all the nobles sent their troops to the capital, he stayed silent on the pretext of being sick.</p>
<p>And on the day of the final battle, Count Fabius, who didn’t move at all, received a call from the nobles.</p>
<p>[Count Fabius do you really think you can survive making that choice?]</p>
<p>[There isn’t a single person in the world who will believe your excuse of being sick. After the sun goes down today, Marquis Benedict will celebrate the death of a man named Count Fabius without care. It is not too late. Send your troops now.]</p>
<p>[You idiot. You normally behave well but at such an important time, you make such a stupid decision!]</p>
<p>Anxiety began to sink in, and he covered his eyes and ears.</p>
<p>And then Roman Dmitry and the nobles collided.</p>
<p>Count Fabius entrusted his fate to the heavens in his comfortable mansion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict immediately contacted Count Fabius. He couldn’t leave the existence that caused trouble within the nobles’ faction alone.</p>
<p><em>Pat.</em></p>
<p>The communication device was connected, and seeing Count Fabius’s face that appeared on the screen, Marquis Benedict let out his anger.</p>
<p>“Fabius, you are really insane. It isn’t enough that you disobeyed the nobles’ faction’s order and didn’t send your troops to Cairos, now what? Are you going to refuse the summons? Look me straight in the face and tell me. Is this your choice, Fabius?”</p>
<p>His voice trembled with anger.</p>
<p>The raccoon of Cairos. Even though he knew that the man was a turncoat, he liked how quick-witted he was, so he kept the man at his side, but now… he was betrayed.</p>
<p>And the fact that the raccoon made this decision and not some other noble was what offended Marquis Benedict—that quick-witted man turned away from him. Doesn’t that mean the nobles would be defeated?</p>
<p>And Count Fabius said,</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict. Let us be honest with each other about what happened. Didn’t your troops get slaughtered by Roman Dmitry in the battle at Cairos? That is the basis of my decision. Roman Dmitry killed all the powerful nobles during the Ranking Matches, and knowing that you would make such a decision, he drew his sword without hesitation. So how will you fight such a monster?]</p>
<p>“You dare do this, you bastard!”</p>
<p>[Ah fuck. Do you still not realize the situation?]</p>
<p>Count Fabius was serious. Just like Viscount Conrad, when he turned around, he clearly showed his attitude.</p>
<p>[I bet everything on Roman Dmitry. So do not look at me like I am a bastard who will still follow you and send my troops to Cairos because I won’t. And you need to accept the fact that I turned my back on you, clear? You probably think of me as a bastard, but what the hell, man? You even contacted me just to say nasty things.]</p>
<p>“… this choice. Are you sure you’re not going to regret it?”</p>
<p>[Regret my ass. If my choice is wrong, will there be anything worse than death?]</p>
<p>“Fabius. You are a traitor to the nobles. No matter what choice you make, do you think Roman Dmitry will use a traitor like you? Traitors remain traitors. If you still decide to stay on the path you have chosen until now but still help the nobles win, I will certainly reward you despite what you did.”</p>
<p>[No. Even if I am faithful to you until the end, you will abandon me without hesitation if you no longer need me, but not Roman Dmitry. Looking at how he accepted Viscount Conrad, he has the tolerance to accept even someone like me, depending on the situation. And haven’t you heard the rumors about him? How much he cares about his people? Even if I start out as a traitor, from now on, I will do anything to please him.]</p>
<p>From the past incidents, Count Fabius knew that the start was important. It was hard to survive against Roman Dmitry if you’d already shown hostility toward him. But if one hadn’t crossed that line, then it wasn’t impossible to change things like Viscount Conrad. So he didn’t send any of his troops, and he didn’t respond to Marquis Benedict and ignored his words.</p>
<p>Finally, Count Fabius smiled and said,</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict. The war starts right now. You don’t seem to know how things are going yet, but I am probably not going to be the only one who has refused your summons. Even then, to try and contact me angrily like this. It will only be a matter of time before the nobility falls.]</p>
<p>At those words, Marquis Benedict’s eyes widened. What did that mean?</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off.</p>
<p>And it didn’t take long for Marquis Benedict to confirm Fabius’s words.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The nobles were summoned, and Count Fabius was the only exception, but most of them expressed their intention to comply. However, suddenly, something unique happened.</p>
<p>[I, Marquis Valentino, will declare that I will support the Dmitry family.]</p>
<p>Valentino from the neutral forces moved. Since a tycoon in Cairo supported Dmitry, the surrounding families were unable to move their troops.</p>
<p>Recently, Valentino spent a fortune sweeping Cairo’s mercenaries. At that time, he made the excuse that he needed manpower in the process of running a company targeting the continent, but never once did he speak about an alliance with the Dmitry family.</p>
<p>And Count Fabius also exerted his strength. He thought that betrayal should be done at its best. Rather than simply relying on a new force with a change of heart, he ran hard so that Roman Dmitry could positively accept his existence. Thanks to this, the families that had a relationship with Count Fabius also changed their minds. And they decided to betray the nobles and follow Dmitry.</p>
<p>And in just a few days, the situation instantly turned around. Shortly after cutting off contact with Fabius, Marquis Benedict received a barrage of calls.</p>
<p>[… I am really sorry. Since we don’t know when Marquis Valentino will attack us, we cannot just send our troops. But still, l hope you know that this is for our best.]</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict. How should we go about this? If we move hastily, there is a chance that our estates will be robbed, and no matter how important the war against the royal faction is, we cannot let our families be in danger.]</p>
<p>[Sorry, but I decided to share the same thought as Count Fabius.]</p>
<p>He felt dizzy even before he tried to do anything. Marquis Benedict had no choice but to watch the power of the nobles diminish.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the Royal Palace Conference Room, the last meeting before their departure was held. Roman Dmitry took the lead and spoke,</p>
<p>“A few days ago, Count Fabius, a nobles’ faction member, announced his intention to follow us. He and several families have changed their minds, and even Marquis Valentino is supporting us, making it impossible for the nobles’ faction to come into full force against us. Now is the chance to wipe out the traitors once and for all.”</p>
<p>At the series of events, the people of the royal faction were shocked.</p>
<p>Count Fabius and Marquis Valentino—it wasn’t their abilities that shocked them, but the plan that was exclusively made by Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘If the King hadn’t accepted Roman Dmitry’s proposal, he might have succeeded in the plot only with Dmitry’s power. And if that happened, the flag of Cairo would have been burned down by the Dmitry family.’</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose. Dmitry’s potential was shocking.</p>
<p>And in the situation where the nobles were driven into a corner, Daniel Cairo asked,</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you want to confront the nobles head-on?”</p>
<p>“You are right. To be precise, it is likely going to be a siege war. If the nobles had responded normally to the call, they would have come straight to the capital, but due to a series of circumstances, they chose to reorganize their troops. We have no reason to give them any slack. We need to mobilize our troops and wipe out the rebels. We have to crush them down with overwhelming force so that no one makes the same mistake in the future.”</p>
<p>Everyone gulped at this—an all-out war. Everyone waited for Daniel Cairo to decide whether they would fight or not.</p>
<p>‘The force leading this war is Dmitry and not the royal faction.’</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo knew the truth. If they won the war, there was a high chance that the people would call Dmitry a kingmaker instead of acknowledging the royal faction’s growth. And as much as how concerning that was, Roman made the plan from start to end. Instead of clearing up the forces that had divided Cairo over the years, Dmitry might form a force huge enough to swallow the Cairo royal family at once. But he had no intention of rejecting them.</p>
<p>‘Dmitry made this decision for Cairo. Even if Dmitry grows beyond our control, we need to acknowledge their existence. It would have been impossible without Dmitry’s help in the first place. A coexistence with Dmitry, who at least treats me as a King, is better for Cairo than the rebellious forces that would sell their King. Cairo’s system has changed. And in order to not lose a possible meaningful existence in the future, we need to actively step out in times when sacrifices are needed. Just in case Roman Dmitry won’t feel it’s unfair, we will do our best to help him.’</p>
<p>And so he made the decision. With a dignified voice, Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“War is inevitable now. Keep in mind that the royal forces will do their best to assist Roman Dmitry and that his orders will be my will. Roman Dmitry, I entrust with you the control over this war.”</p>
<p>All eyes were on him, and Roman responded like a soldier,</p>
<p>“I will follow your order.”</p>
<p>The fuse for the war had been lit. From now on, it was time to slaughter the traitors.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 175 - For A Certain End (1)</p>
<p>The sun shone through the window. A middle-aged man, who was lying in an infirmary bed, struggled to open his eyes and looked out the window with blank eyes.</p>
<p>“… I am not dead.”</p>
<p>His voice was dry.</p>
<p>The man’s identity was Count Nicholas. His expression was slightly distorted at the belated pain, and he lowered his gaze to check the condition of his body. He was a mess. As if to prove how terrible his condition was, his entire upper body was covered in bandages.</p>
<p>‘Only the external wounds are serious. Roman Dmitry had no intention of killing me.’</p>
<p>That was the conclusion he reached after examining his body. The wound ran from his upper chest down to his pubic bone, but only the skin was cut, and there were no internal wounds.</p>
<p>It was clear that Dmitry had shown him mercy. Although he displayed a dramatic scene for those who were watching, this proved that Roman was sincere.</p>
<p>In his hazy memories, he remembered what Roman told him at the end,</p>
<p>“Do not worry about the aftermath. I have no intention of betraying Cairo.”</p>
<p>And right after hearing that, Count Nicholas was hit.</p>
<p>People thought that Count Nicholas had his eyes open when he sensed his impending death, but the truth and sincerity in Roman’s voice remained in his head.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand Roman Dmitry’s intentions. All this time, he made no contact with the Cairo royal family. Rather, he seemed to get along with other forces, such as Marquis Benedict. Roman Dmitry was the balance of this land. His decision to join the nobles meant that the royal faction without Count Nicholas had lost.</p>
<p>So he accepted the challenge of a Ranking Match. By defeating Roman Dmitry, he wanted to show how strong he was, but the result was a crushing defeat. People would think it was a fierce match, but Count Nicholas, who wielded the sword himself, knew that Roman Dmitry was stronger than him. Otherwise, it couldn’t have been so overwhelming in their first head-on confrontation.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry considered Count Nicholas’s intentions and never pushed him back until the end, as he constantly showed him mercy. And his defeat was an unfortunate result.</p>
<p>However, the fact that he was still alive and the words he heard at the end caused Count Nicholas to worry.</p>
<p>‘I need to understand what the situation is.’</p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>He got up.</p>
<p>Even though he still needed time to recover, for Count Nicholas, it was more important to understand the situation of the royal family than his safety.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Simon.</p>
<p>Seeing Count Nicholas look up at him, Simon looked like he would burst into tears at any moment.</p>
<p>“… all I was told was that the commander might die. I am…. am so fortunate.”</p>
<p>Count Nicholas was the sky for Simon.</p>
<p>Count Nicholas showed him a warm smile.</p>
<p>“You have suffered a lot all this time.”</p>
<p>“No. I just did what I had to do.”</p>
<p>“If you hadn’t led and become the center of the Royal Knights, the chaos in Cairo would have increased. I am so proud of you. Because of you, I was able to comfortably join the Ranking Matches.”</p>
<p>Half a year ago, he left the vacant post of lieutenant to Simon. People expressed their doubts about Simon’s skills, which couldn’t even touch a 4-star swordsman, but Count Nicholas thought that Simon was the right person.</p>
<p>The Royal Knights were the guardians of the royal family. In order to maintain an unwavering heart despite all kinds of desires, loyalty to the royal family was more important than sword skills.</p>
<p>And that was Simon. He was in his mid-40s, and even if his potential as a swordsman wasn’t that great, he was fit to hold the title of a Royal Knight.</p>
<p>And Count Nicholas said,</p>
<p>“Simon. Tell me what happened while I was unconscious.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Right after the commander collapsed…”</p>
<p>He started talking about the clash between the nobles and Roman Dmitry, and how Roman Dmitry went to the King and offered a deal and explained the process of the civil war. And during that time, he developed a sincere respect for Roman. Even though he was carrying out his work for a certain price, the process of how he was able to do it was truly admirable.</p>
<p>The disposition of the imperial factions and his plan to break the enemies’ plan with the support of a tycoon named Valentino. The royal faction held the upper hand. Just by bringing in one ally, Roman Dmitry and the royal faction were able to get so many others.</p>
<p>“… that is what happened. We are about to embark on the mission soon. The commander is Roman Dmitry, and we intend to immediately attack the nobles of Marquis Benedict’s faction.”</p>
<p>The explanation was over, and Count Nicholas was lost in thought. Roman Dmitry was the best swordsman Cairo ever had. Depending on the choice he made, the game of Cairo could somehow change, but Roman Dmitry gave up on glory and wealth as he sided with the King.</p>
<p>And he was extremely grateful for that. The fact that the monster he couldn’t handle didn’t abandon the royal family was something he felt thankful for.</p>
<p>In this war, if they lost, it was all over. Even if he couldn’t go to the battlefield with his current injury, he couldn’t just sit down either.</p>
<p>“Simon, take me to the place where the military meetings are being held. I need to work there.”</p>
<p>Emotions grew inside of him. There was a chance to set the kingdom right.</p>
<p>At this historic moment, he wanted to contribute even a little bit.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Finally, the moment of the decisive battle has arrived. Roman Dmitry prepared for the marching ceremony.</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>He wore a different outfit than usual. Roman, who was normally minimally armed because it interfered with his movements, was now fully armed, representing the royal family. His silver armor was engraved with the symbol of the royal family. And his white skin and black hair had a charm that made people turn their heads to look at him. Even from far away, you could see the people waiting for him.</p>
<p>And then there were the people of the royal faction, including King Daniel Cairo, and an unexpected person on the other side—Count Nicholas. He appeared with a wounded body.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry knew what it meant.</p>
<p>‘Count Nicholas is the symbol of the military. Showing up at the military parade even after losing to me in the match means that he completely entrusts the authority of the military to me. The King and Count Nicholas too. They haven’t yet lost their goodness despite the chaos the power system created.’</p>
<p>Roman might be attracted to their goodness in some way. If he followed the Marquis, he would have gotten the chance to devour Cairo, but he knew that his little desires wouldn’t be satisfied with just that. He hoped Cairo would play a similar role to the friendly relationship Baek Joong-hyuk had with the Emperor during the time he ruled Murim.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He took his place. The numerous troops looked up at Roman who also looked at them and calmly said,</p>
<p>“Cairo has been through a chaotic time. The nobles, including Marquis Benedict, are people who only care about their own interests rather than the safety of this nation, and due to their actions, Cairo was never given a peaceful life. We are going to punish those traitors. What will we get from a civil war that causes people born in the same place or lineage to kill each other and leave behind pain? Well, I promise to completely clean up the chaos in Cairo after this war is over. And…”</p>
<p>He drew his sword.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>Those who trembled with anxiety needed the conviction—the right one—to win.</p>
<p>“I will always be at the forefront of this war. So trust me and follow. If I open the way, you can follow and achieve victory.”</p>
<p>“Woahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Roman! Roman!”</p>
<p>“Roman! Roman!”</p>
<p>The people went insane. Cairo’s most terrifying presence and the words he said about fighting at the forefront made the people put their blind trust in him.</p>
<p>There was no turning back now.</p>
<p>War.</p>
<p>The battle for the fate of the nation has begun.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The response of the nobles’ faction was as expected. After gathering their troops at the Benedict estate, they held a meeting on how the royal family was moving.</p>
<p>“If they use a nearby warp gate, the army of the King will attack Benedict within a week at the earliest. Right now, the odds of an all-out war are slim. We have to lock the gates and look for a chance to turn things around while taking advantage of this place.”</p>
<p>Just as one noble said, the condition of the nobles wasn’t good. Even at first, he thought that with enough troops they could wipe out the royal family, but Marquis Valentino’s declaration and Count Fabius’s betrayal were fatal to them.</p>
<p>And aside from the raccoon of Cairo, they couldn’t figure out why Marquis Valentino changed his mind. He was a key presence among the nobles.</p>
<p>And Viscount Owen said,</p>
<p>“Marquis Valentino has always been neutral. In preparation for the problems that would arise from taking sides with one faction, he ended up drawing a line. And such a person openly supports Roman Dmitry. It means that the nobles are moving behind this new power, and in fact, no one can stop Roman Dmitry, who didn’t lose to a single ranker.”</p>
<p>All of them acknowledged it. Roman’s plan was too perfect. It was as if he attracted Marquis Valentino, and when he was told of the results of the Ranking Matches, the man must have been impressed.</p>
<p>However, the issue was that that person would be their enemy now. Hearing of his success on the Southern Front, no one thought he would declare an all-out war.</p>
<p>“Currently, the nobles’ faction is unable to properly use the strength we have. I think we need to accept the reality and take some damage in order to defeat Roman Dmitry and their army. Marquis Benedict, how about contacting Kronos and the nobles of Valhalla? They have no choice but to worry about the future with their leaders being held captive. If we offer them a suitable reward, they will surely not be able to refuse our offer.”</p>
<p>“… that isn’t a bad idea.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict nodded. With the exception of the royal faction, they always had the option of joining forces with the other two factions. If Gregory and Denver were in good health, they would have chosen to wait, but now they are not here.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict asked,</p>
<p>“How long will it take to appease them?”</p>
<p>“It should be at least fifteen days. It takes time to change the minds of those from the other factions, and it will take a good amount of time to assemble and bring them together. So we need to buy time for them to get here. While buying time, if we bring in support from others and try to attack from both sides like them, we can defeat Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>“I get it. I will entrust you with the full authority in that regard.”</p>
<p>“I accept your orders.”</p>
<p>Even with the new measures, the atmosphere wasn’t so hopeful. At the thought of a devil named Roman Dmitry arriving, the nobles couldn’t react positively.</p>
<p>The massacre in Cairos was one-sided. Hundreds of troops that were secretly brought were killed, and those who tried to stop Roman were brutally killed. And from what they heard, those who weren’t able to use the warp gate didn’t even get to surrender. They were killed right there.</p>
<p>Their mouths would go dry even now when they thought of how he cut off the heads of all those who knelt down and prayed.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“The war broke out suddenly, but we had been preparing for this war against the royals for a long time. Benedict is equipped with supplies and a perfect defense system, and with this amount of preparation, we can even withstand the Kronos Empire’s onslaught. So have no doubt that we will win. As always, after everything is sorted, our nobles’ faction will have the power in Cairo.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“We will do our best.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere changed as they realized that Marquis Benedict was right. Even though the flames of the war suddenly spread, that didn’t mean that they were unprepared for it. They were confident now. Time was on their side.</p>
<p>And they were convinced that if he led them while buying time, they would be able to destroy the royals. They believed in themselves that, as always, the nobles would come out victorious.</p>
<p>And a week later, Roman Dmitry’s army appeared in front of the Benedict Castle.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Shortly after arriving in Benedict, Simon came over to him and asked,</p>
<p>“Commander. In preparation for the long-term battle, they seemed to have built a good stronghold.”</p>
<p>The walls of the Benedict Castle were high enough to be called forts. The battle wouldn’t end in a day or two, so Simon’s judgment was correct. But…</p>
<p>“No, speed is important in this war. The more time we give the nobles, the more options they will have. Therefore, we shall prepare for the first hit before establishing our positions.”</p>
<p>It was a bold decision. If they get hurt, the soldiers would have to spend more time carrying the heavy bodies and building camps. But…</p>
<p>“Felix, prepare for a siege.”</p>
<p>At Roman’s command, a robed man appeared. As for Simon, he looked back and forth between the robed man and Roman Dmitry with befuddled eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 176 - For A Certain End (2)</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>The army of Cairo was moving. The main frame for the launchers was moved with wheels, and the other parts were placed on a cart to be assembled later one by one.</p>
<p>The troops on the wall watched this scene. They had no idea what the kingdom’s army was up to, but they weren’t worried either.</p>
<p>“So is that a Flare?”</p>
<p>A guard of the Benedict Castle’s gate said. He was Cameron, the captain of the guards. The use of a Flare was essential for warfare when it came to a siege. And a powerful siege weapon would make the castle lose its advantage.</p>
<p>In a fight between ordinary nobles, the ones with more money would get a Flare, but a Flare would always be used in a civil war on a national level. Even at a glance, the kingdom’s army appeared to be planning to install up to five of them.</p>
<p>And after about two hours of installation, its firepower would be able to collapse the wall.</p>
<p>But Benedict was different.</p>
<p>‘Staying in Benedict Castle is one of the things we have been preparing for. By making a request to the Magic Tower, we have installed a strong Magic Defense on the walls of the Benedict Castle. It has the defensive power to withstand dozens of Flares, and it even has the ability to recover if it is replenished with enough mana stones, even if its durability is worn out. Cairo’s forces can never capture Benedict.’</p>
<p>Replacing the King was their ultimate goal as nobles. They never overdid it with the precarious power system, but they were steadily preparing for the rebellion over the years. The Magic Defense was just the start. The military training of the soldiers was also carried out steadily, and various options, such as Plan A and B in case of a rebellion, were calculated in advance.</p>
<p>Of course, they also considered what to do if the royal faction attacked first. They didn’t expect that the royal faction would form an alliance with Dmitry, but they also didn’t really think it would change things either. They had an impenetrable wall, and they were able to secure a lot of war materials. Cameron trusted Benedict.</p>
<p>Thinking that the soldiers might be scared, he raised his voice,</p>
<p>“You know that the commander of the army is Roman Dmitry. He is the Southern Front Devil and the best swordsman in Cairo, who has defeated Count Nicholas. But this is a war on a national scale. Even if he is strong, it means nothing if he cannot cross the walls of Benedict Castle, which have been installed with defensive magic by the Magic Tower. In the end, it means that he is just a mere human in front of these tall castle walls.”</p>
<p>Their anxieties were due to the existence of Roman Dmitry. As he reassured the people who looked nervous, Cameron gave them something to believe in.</p>
<p>“Trust me. The enemies will not be able to cross the walls, and the final victors will be our nobles.”</p>
<p>Because of Cameron’s confidence and basis for faith, everyone was feeling positive.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The appearance of the individuals in robes caused everyone to become agitated.</p>
<p>“… who are they?”</p>
<p>“They seem to be up to something.”</p>
<p>Above the castle walls, the troops of the nobles seemed anxious. Their enemy’s unexpected movement gave them an ominous feeling, but they didn’t show it. The safest place was behind the walls, and because they were being protected by the Magic Defense on the walls, they didn’t have to be too anxious.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the individuals in robes, who had been preparing for a while, approached someone to see if the work was over.</p>
<p>“Team 1, preparations are complete.”</p>
<p>“Team 2, preparations are complete.”</p>
<p>These individuals in robes were the magicians from the Phoenix Magic Tower. Felix, who hid his face in a robe, recalled what Roman had told him a month ago.</p>
<p>“Once the Ranking Matches start, Dmitry cannot avoid being caught up in a war. At that time, I will intentionally push the enemy into a corner and start a siege. Felix, your role is to bring your people there to tear them down.”</p>
<p>A month ago, when everyone else was enjoying peace, Phoenix began to prepare for the war. On Roman’s orders, they were ready to risk their lives. The Phoenix Tower was revived thanks to Roman Dmitry, and they quickly found stability with his full support. It was truly the gift of a lifetime.</p>
<p>Everyone in the Phoenix Tower was ready to do anything for Roman Dmitry, and when the order for the siege was given, Felix and the other magicians all laughed for joy.</p>
<p>Magicians were the flowers of siege warfare, and they were given the best role. Now their goal was to pay back for the meals Dmitry had given them.</p>
<p>And Felix said,</p>
<p>“The Lord has done so much for us. Even silent beasts can recognize the goodness of their owners, but we haven’t done anything for our Lord. And finally, the time has come. The Lord has given us a mission that we excel at, and if we cannot do it right, then our existence has no meaning.”</p>
<p>His voice was heavy. Because of what they would do, people would die. However, the moment they would take a step into the battlefield, they had no thoughts of stepping back.</p>
<p>“Let’s show it to the enemies. How the Phoenix Magic Tower has been able to hold the position of the 13th Magic Tower on the continent.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Your orders will be executed.”</p>
<p>The wizards started to move. There were three of them for each launcher. They immediately started to generate mana, and the pattern engraved on the launcher reacted to it and emitted light.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>‘Commonly known Flares have limitations on their damage. If their Magic Defense was properly installed, then they would not break even with the Flares. But what if a magician can amplify the power of a Flare? Its attack power will exceed the limit and the defensive magic on their walls will break down because these are not regular Flares.’</p>
<p>Mana resonated, and the magicians continued. In particular, the Phoenix magicians were known to have mana with the fire attribute that perfectly harmonized with the Flares.</p>
<p><em>Bam.</em></p>
<p><em>Pung!</em></p>
<p><em>Pupupung!</em></p>
<p>The Flares were fired, and the fireballs hit the castle walls.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>They held a strong power. The soldiers screamed at the impact that shook the walls, and they looked at the captain of the guards with shocked faces. The man had told them that the walls had Magic Defense that couldn’t be broken down even with the Flares.</p>
<p>However, the tremendous shock they felt made it seem like they could destroy the castle walls all at once. Even those who didn’t know about the Magic Defense were now taking the situation more seriously.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Boom!</em></p>
<p>The attacks continued. Depending on the amount of mana the magicians generated, the flames caused explosions on similar levels.</p>
<p>The flowers of siege warfare—it was the power of magicians. And among the 13 Magic Towers, the Phoenix Magic Tower specialized in fire the most.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“Captain of the guards! The durability of our best Magic Defense is rapidly declining.”</p>
<p>“If things continue like this, the walls will not stand! Please give us your order!”</p>
<p>The reports kept coming in from all directions, and Cameron looked pale. He never imagined that a kingdom’s army would be able to mobilize magicians in such a large number.</p>
<p>‘The magicians who belong to the Magic Towers always stay neutral. In fights between nations, they sometimes lend their strength to the nation that supported them, but in cases such as civil wars, they never step forward. So who are they? I wouldn’t have cared if there were just one or two, but dozens of magicians are supporting the royal family. Even if the King himself went to secure magicians, this number of people makes no sense.’</p>
<p>He was shocked by the dozens of magicians. This was beyond normal. There has never been a case in the history of the continent’s Magic Towers where they have sent such a large number of people to fight in a foreign nation.</p>
<p>First, he had to solve the problem. As the attacks continued, Cameron shouted loudly,</p>
<p>“Activate the emergency defense system! Even if we have to use all the mana stones, make sure to protect the Magic Defense from losing its durability! Once the walls fall, there is no turning back! Mobilize the ballista right now and destroy the launchers!”</p>
<p>The flames went out. He gave a command that contradicted his words earlier. The war materials would run out quickly, but Cameron had no other options.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cameron wasn’t the only one surprised by the turn of events. Staring at the fire-breathing machines, Simon had a startled expression.</p>
<p>“… what the hell is this?”</p>
<p>Magicians—it was a power that even the Cairo royal family didn’t possess. However, they were very active in attacking the nobles, following Roman Dmitry’s orders. It made no sense.</p>
<p>How on earth did he appease the magicians?</p>
<p>The answer came from Chris.</p>
<p>“Not too long ago, the Phoenix Magic Tower came and settled in the Dmitry estate. In general, the Magic Towers claim to be neutral and do not intervene in civil wars, but the Phoenix Magic Tower belongs to a noble family now. If Dmitry decides to become the sword of Cairo, shouldn’t the Phoenix Magic Tower also help?”</p>
<p>At his blunt response, Simon was shocked. According to what Chris said, it meant that these magicians were from a Magic Tower that belonged to Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘The 13th Magic Tower. It lost its skills and was considered to have the lowest number of people, but it was called the best in the continent for its attacks and flames. A group that would be welcomed anywhere swore their allegiance to Dmitry.’</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose. What if Daniel Cairo rejected Dmitry’s offer? Then Dmitry could have taken down the nobles with the power of the magicians alone.</p>
<p>And if he had pointed his sword at the Cairo royal family, it was clear that the high walls alone would not be able to defend against Dmitry’s attacks.</p>
<p>The choice of the King was a godsend. If he hadn’t embraced Dmitry, they would have faced the monstrous Roman Dmitry and the magicians as enemies.</p>
<p>‘The heavens didn’t abandon Cairo. We made the right decision.’</p>
<p>He let out a sigh of relief. The more he saw the true face of Dmitry, the more Simon was convinced that the war would end in their victory.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sun went down. When the first battle was over, Cameron went to report the results with a miserable face.</p>
<p>“… in order to prevent the attack from the royal faction, we had no choice but to use 30% of the mana stones that we had prepared in advance. I apologize. But please consider the fact that the enemies have magicians. If we hadn’t acted quickly, the walls wouldn’t have lasted long and would have collapsed right away.”</p>
<p>In this meeting, none of the members of the nobles’ faction could blame Cameron. Didn’t they see it too? The nobles watching the situation clenched their hands whenever the flames on the castle’s walls exploded.</p>
<p>They were overwhelmed by the sight. Since they had never imagined the royals would have secured dozens of wizards, the anxiety about the walls collapsing spread to each of them.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the attacks stopped. But just like Cameron’s miserable expression, no one could take it positively that they lasted one day.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict said,</p>
<p>“So how long will they last?”</p>
<p>“… our opponent has dozens of magicians. If they repeat the same attack with proper rest, then we will not be able to last more than ten days even if we replenish with the mana stones that we have.”</p>
<p>“The longest we can survive is ten days?”</p>
<p>It felt hopeless. Roman Dmitry’s strategy was too simple. As soon as he arrived in Benedict, he attempted an attack, and as soon as the mana of the magicians was exhausted, he retreated with his troops, and they would be able to get plenty of rest.</p>
<p>The nobles’ troops couldn’t let down their guards even for a moment against the attacks that could come at any time, but the royal faction did not seem to have any intention of attacking unreasonably.</p>
<p>Ten days like this—it was a completely different pace that favored the royals. While being attacked with such magic, the nobles would get tired, and they wouldn’t be able to stop the troops rushing in when the gates would collapse.</p>
<p>Their plan to appease the empires’ factions hasn’t brought any results yet. The process of appeasing them and assembling their troops would take time, but the movement of the royal faction was so fast and powerful.</p>
<p>Finally, there was just one person the nobles could trust.</p>
<p>“Viscount Owen. What happened to Baron Winston?”</p>
<p>“The troops have gathered, and they have arrived at the entrance in the northeast. The situation could still change. If Baron Winston captures the Dmitry estate, which is empty now, Roman Dmitry will not be able to attack us as he did today. And once that happens, we just need to buy time and bring in the empires’ factions.”</p>
<p>“What is the probability that the attack on the Dmitry estate will fail?”</p>
<p>“We will succeed. Isn’t Baron Winston the proud commander? With his skills, he can destroy the northeast within a day. The only variable is the possibility that there are magicians in Dmitry. However, considering that dozens of magicians have already participated in attacking Benedict Castle, it is almost impossible for them to have any more magicians. And even if that variable does happen, the probability that the result will change due to their presence is not very high.”</p>
<p>Think about it. The opponents were on the outskirts, and with Roman Dmitry away, who would stop their attack?</p>
<p>Not all of those who belonged to the nobles’ faction gathered at Benedict Castle. They split their forces into two, and some of them followed Baron Winston to Dmitry.</p>
<p>Fake in the west and hit in the east. Benedict wasn’t too surprised. After deliberately locking the castle and distracting them, he chose a clever strategy to rob the enemy’s main estate.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s eyes were sharp.</p>
<p>“Deliver this to Baron Winston. In this war, defeat is not allowed, and I will give you full control of everything that happens in the process of bringing down Dmitry, so I need us to be the victors in the end. The Cairo royal family is a sand castle waiting to fall, so if we can deal with Dmitry, then the army of the royal faction will be shaken.”</p>
<p>The nobles were convinced that within three days, the news of their victory would arrive, and then the real rebellion would begin.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 177 - For A Certain End (3)</p>
<p>At that time, as the nobles said, Baron Winston arrived in the Northeast. After ordering the soldiers to rest, he called for the captains to hold a meeting.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>And then he opened the map.</p>
<p>The lieutenant, who was appointed to one area, said,</p>
<p>“If we advance a little further from this area, we will find Count Adelian’s estate. And Adelian is a commercially developed city, so it isn’t quite used to military stuff, but the problem is we don’t have much time. According to what the main unit said, we have ten days here. We need to fight, but dealing with each enemy on the way to Dmitry will take up too much time.”</p>
<p>“You’re right. Ten days is a tight schedule. Even the march to Dmitry is tight.”</p>
<p>The captains looked concerned. When no one else could think of an answer, they all turned to Baron Winston.</p>
<p>Winston was the commander who served on the Western Front. He was a noble from the outskirts, but he joined the nobles’ faction since he was recognized for his skills in defeating the Kronos Empire’s attempts to invade the kingdom.</p>
<p>And after that, whenever there was a military-related fight, Marquis Benedict would always put him in charge.</p>
<p>He checked the map for a while. It was something he had confirmed before the dispatch because he wanted to be extra careful, considering that it was a battlefield.</p>
<p>“You people are right. Ten days from today, considering the travel time, pointless fights will only make things worse. Which means we have to minimize the fights and the distance… and the fastest way is to pass through these estates here.”</p>
<p><em>Tak. Tak. Tak.</em></p>
<p>He put three pins on the map—Adelian, Rollo, and Conrad. He already had a plan.</p>
<p>Baron Winston, who repeated the names of the three estates, looked at the captains and said,</p>
<p>“There are pro-Dmitry factions in the northeastern area. In the wake of the battle with the North, Dmitry carefully established the Dmitry alliance, but that doesn’t mean that they are already loyal. And Adelian, Rollo, and Conrad were the three estates that were not pro-Dmitry before.”</p>
<p>Adelian was neutral. Rollo and Conrad were from the Northeast Nobles’ Alliance. When Roman Dmitry held the tournament, Rollo and Conrad sent out their swordsmen.</p>
<p>Then there was a way.</p>
<p>“Adelian is a commercial place. They don’t want their link with the Central Government to be cut off, so they want to avoid any extreme situations. In the case of Baron Rollo and Viscount Conrad, there is a high chance that they still hate Dmitry now. Therefore, send a message to all three of them. What we want is not their cooperation. All we need is a way to get to our goal without any issues and an extension of time.”</p>
<p>Winston was clever. He made a decision that didn’t require the opponent to make extreme choices. While the opponents turned their gazes, the nobles turned around and moved as inconspicuously as possible.</p>
<p>It was a normal thing to happen in war. Even though he could be unconditionally discovered by the enemy’s scouts and attacked, if he managed to take down Dmitry with the help of those three nobles, then he would be fine.</p>
<p>The command was given, and the magic communication device was connected.</p>
<p>[We, the nobles’ faction, do not have any grudges against the nobles of the Northeast. All we want is Dmitry, so if you choose to turn your heads, we will reward you accordingly. Choose. If you want to fight to the death, the estate that reject this offer will be turned into a sea of fire.]</p>
<p>It was a proper warning. He didn’t think any more time was needed.</p>
<p>And one hour later, the three estates said that they would accept the proposal.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Three days have passed since then, and Baron Winston’s forces moved through the night. They passed Count Adelian’s estate before anyone knew, and their speed increased as they entered Baron Rollo’s estate.</p>
<p>And while moving, the lieutenant asked,
“… Commander. Do you trust the Northeastern nobles? If they had set a trap on purpose, we are likely to be attacked from all sides.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>He thought about the unknown variables. There was no way the commander of the Western Front hadn’t thought of that, so he said,</p>
<p>“First, we need to move quickly to lessen the risk. Even if this is a trap, they have been in a quandary since the moment they accepted our offer. The main unit said that most of Dmitry’s troops have joined the war. Then, the troops here are nothing more than ragtag. Do you think they can win against our elite troops?”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“Right, it’s impossible. The soldiers of the nobles’ faction had gone through the toughest training for rebellion. War means that we cannot deal with things like those written in books, and if the enemy attacks thinking we are trapped, then we are at an advantage. It is a golden opportunity. Originally, we were supposed to fight behind the walls. No matter how different the soldiers’ skills are, the other side will be the one taking the most damage. But what if the land is open on all sides like this? In a fight with troops from both sides, the Northeast will collapse under our force.”</p>
<p>He made this decision with betrayal in mind, as he didn’t trust his opponent. He used them since he needed them, but he had no intention of being careless.</p>
<p>A battlefield was always like that. Those who talked about romance and blindly believed in others would die without lasting even a year.</p>
<p>“There are not that many cities with warp gates in the Cairo Kingdom. And among them, Benedict and Adelian are included. And if troops come from Adelian, there is a way for us to deal with them and even seize the warp gate. If that happens, Dmitry will have a fire set on their feet.”</p>
<p>“… as expected.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant admired him. The man from the Western Front was so different.</p>
<p>The commander, who survived the battlefield of blood and death, chose the most appropriate way to destroy the opponent. Every choice he made was deliberate. The nobles were confident, and they planned on taking down Dmitry at once. But…</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>The night fell, and fire erupted from every direction. As expected, the lords of the Northeast betrayed them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Adelian, Rollo, and Conrad, the three lords, didn’t have to worry about anything.</p>
<p>Who was Roman Dmitry?</p>
<p>If they looked at his previous actions, they would see that he was the type of person who had his own ways of giving punishment and reward.</p>
<p>It was clear that the traitor would be destroyed no matter what excuse he made, and if they wanted to maintain their relationship with Dmitry, they needed to do this.</p>
<p>Then the choice was obvious. As soon as Baron Winston sent the offer, they contacted Dmitry and asked him how to deal with it.</p>
<p>[Open the way. Just lure them in and wipe them out.]</p>
<p>And now the alliance has come forward, with countless troops surrounding the enemies and flames that shone across the land.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>“Baron Winston. We have received reports that you are trying to coax the nobles here with the idea of attacking Dmitry. The nobles from Marquis Benedict’s faction are treasonous. If you surrender, your choice will be taken into account, and you will be given mercy. But if you rebel, you will be charged with rebellion like Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>It was Jonathan, the captain of the knights. Dmitry’s flag was fluttering behind him.</p>
<p>And at the sight of the enemies filling his vision, Baron Winston was shocked. The number of enemies was too great. He expected a good number, but it looked like all the troops from the Northeast had come here.</p>
<p>“… Commander.”</p>
<p>Baron Winston focused his eyes as he drew his sword. He wasn’t going to compromise now. Even if there were many enemies, he believed that the nobles’ elite troops could crush them.</p>
<p>“Stop talking nonsense! Marquis Benedict is not a traitor! That is just an accusation spread by Dmitry. Rather, I give you this proposal, if you surrender now, Marquis Benedict will accept you with great generosity, but the moment you show hostility…”</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>He raised his aura. There was no going back. They had already crossed a river too wide.</p>
<p>“We will kill all of you right here.”</p>
<p>He had a menacing power, but no one seemed to be shaken. Baron Winston was someone who had experienced battles countless times, and the people in the Northeast under Dmitry? They had only experienced Roman.</p>
<p>There were people who were also Roman’s enemies here. For those who had already experienced extreme terror in front of Roman, Baron Winston didn’t look like much.</p>
<p>In this precipitous situation, Jonathan finally made a decision.</p>
<p>“Knox. Please.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>A man stepped forward.</p>
<p>Even at that time, Baron Winston had no idea what Jonathan was planning.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Like the concerns of the nobles, the variables turned into reality.</p>
<p>Dmitry had magicians, even 5-circle ones too.</p>
<p>“Fire Cannon.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>The flame was strong. The moment Winston looked at them, the fire had already hit the nobles from their side.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik, wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ackkk!”</em></p>
<p>A strong flame was cast again. Hundreds of their soldiers were swept away at once as they were charred black. However, the soldiers nearby weren’t safe. They were also caught in the fire and were rolling on the ground in pain from their skin burning. It was just one spell, but the result was too strong.</p>
<p>Baron Winston, who witnessed it, could only shout,</p>
<p>“All attack!”</p>
<p>He already made the choice, and winning was the only way out. The magic of the magicians terrified the soldiers, but they still believed in their strength, but…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The results in front of his eyes were different from what he had expected. And when the troops faced each other, the soldiers from the nobles’ faction were slaughtered one-sidedly.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s men were slaughtering them all at once. And Baron Winston couldn’t accept this situation.</p>
<p>The ragtag soldiers of the frontier must have had crude skills, but Dmitry’s soldiers seemed like they didn’t lack any experience compared with the soldiers from the Western Front.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t know that last year, when Roman Dmitry gave those around him time to prepare, it didn’t just mean his own subordinates, like Chris, but all those related to Dmitry.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s soldiers learned to fight. Just like Roman’s men, they didn’t know how to handle mana, but they learned how to make their bodies strong. And this was the result of their intense training.</p>
<p>The more Roman Dmitry grew, the more the soldiers wanted to become stronger, and they all worked hard without taking any breaks. And as a result, they were totally different from a year ago. In order to kill one Dmitry soldier, at least ten of the nobles’ soldiers had to die.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p>‘This is insane.’</p>
<p>As Baron Winston tried to attack, an unknown knight blocked his path. And only then did he see the reality. They ignored the Northeastern’s skills and power, yet these people were sharper than them.</p>
<p>The nobles’ plans were all in Roman’s palms. The reason he attacked Benedict with his elite troops was that he knew that the other troops back home wouldn’t have any trouble.</p>
<p>However, Baron Winston was desperate now. To live up to Marquis Benedict’s expectations of him, he continued to shout for victory until the end, but he eventually died at the hands of Captain Jonathan.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>He had also learned the Asura technique, and being one step above Baron Winston, he killed him at once.</p>
<p>And that was all. On the fourth day after Dmitry attacked Benedict, Baron Winston’s troops had been defeated.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It’s been a week since the war started. It was as if they went back and forth between heaven and hell every day.</p>
<p>And in one morning, the nobles clenched their fists at the reply from an empire’s faction.</p>
<p>[We will join the nobles.]</p>
<p>It went as planned. If an empire’s faction joined them, then the situation could be changed.</p>
<p>But at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwaaang!</em></p>
<p>“We have bad news! A part of the wall has now collapsed. The repairs on the castle’s wall were being carried out, but it wasn’t easy because the kingdom’s troops were continuously attacking. Please give us an order. At this rate, we won’t be able to last long.”</p>
<p>The lights went off, and Marquis Benedict had a contorted face.</p>
<p>One week. It should have been just one week, and he could have managed to get the empires’ factions to join, so the walls shouldn’t be collapsing like this.</p>
<p>“Baron Winston? What happened to Baron Winston?”</p>
<p>“T-That…”</p>
<p>Viscount Owen was speechless. A few days ago, they had lost all contact with Baron Winston. According to the plan, there should have been immediate results, but word started to spread that contact wasn’t being established.</p>
<p>His stomach churned at this unforeseen situation.</p>
<p>At that moment, more despair struck them.</p>
<p>“We got a call from Baron Winston’s lieutenant! The army that attacked the Dmitry estate was annihilated! Baron Winston died on the spot, and the defeated soldiers had run away!”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Defeat.</p>
<p>Only then did he realize it—the fact that there was a place lower than hell.</p>
<p>At this dark reality, Marquis Benedict’s mind sank into the abyss.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 178 - For A Certain End (4)</p>
<p>His head spun. Was it real or was it some kind of dream? Marquis Benedict, who enjoyed unparalleled power until fifteen days ago, looked ahead, shocked.</p>
<p>“Tell me the solution!”</p>
<p>“Solution? It is over. Baron Winston’s army has been annihilated, and the castle’s walls will fall down at any moment. Didn’t the imperial factions also suddenly cut off their contact with us? The only way to survive is to open the gates and surrender!”</p>
<p>“Surrender! You think that makes sense?!”</p>
<p>It was a mess. The people who had never raised their voices against Marquis Benedict were now furious and had red faces. It was truly a desperate situation. At one point in time, he thought that the nobles were the future of Cairo, but when he faced this crisis, he felt that they were the sandcastle of Cairo.</p>
<p>And it was at that moment when….</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>“Everyone stop! Now isn’t the time for this.”</p>
<p>It was Viscount Owen. Seeing him hit the table, the nobles gulped.</p>
<p>“As you all said, we are being driven to the edge right now. But surrendering is not possible. Even though it hasn’t been revealed outside, according to the information leaked from the northeastern region, Roman Dmitry was involved in Barco’s death. Not just that, even if we look at the steps he has taken until now, Roman Dmitry hasn’t shown any mercy to those who were hostile to him. It means that he is different from the weak King. And if we open the gates to surrender? Normal soldiers will be spared, but all the leaders here will be decapitated by that man.”</p>
<p>“… so what are we going to do? The mana stones maintaining the Magic Defense are running out.”</p>
<p>“Right. Two or three days at most, and during that time, we must reverse the situation.”</p>
<p>They turned to Marquis Benedict. Looking at him who was still shocked, Viscount Owen spoke in a firm voice,</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict. The imperial factions aren’t the only forces that can solve this. Why don’t we skip them and directly work with the empires?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“This is a fight that is over anyway. And instead of waiting to die here, it is more important to survive. Then the Kronos Empire will not refuse our offer. They have always wanted to use Cairo as the starting point for their conquest, so they will unconditionally accept our offer. Our last chance to convince the empire is when all of the leaders of the imperial faction are taken away.”</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict’s eyes came to life.</p>
<p>Not yet. The war wasn’t over yet. The castle hasn’t collapsed yet, and now was their last chance to get their hands on something good before it falls down.</p>
<p>The trouble was short-lived as they had made their decision.</p>
<p>“Contact Kronos right now. I will talk to them myself.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The magic communication device was connected right away.</p>
<p>When Baron Charlton, a member of Kronos’s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, appeared on the screen, Marquis Benedict got straight to the point.</p>
<p>“I think you already realize our situation. Please save the nobles’ factions. If you help us destroy the royal family, we will pledge our allegiance to the Kronos Empire from now on and promise to be your vassals.”</p>
<p>There was no more pretense. When he lowered his head, he wasn’t acting like an idiot who lost his pride.</p>
<p>[… Hmm. I am sorry, but there are already forces following Kronos in Cairo. Isn’t it an open fact that it’s Count Gregory? If we want to choose a scarecrow to rule Cairo, then it will be Gregory for the work he has done until now and not you Marquis Benedict.]</p>
<p>“Yes, I understand. But the situation is different right now.”</p>
<p>And he spoke with some strength in his voice.</p>
<p>If he couldn’t persuade them, then they would die at the hands of that devil.</p>
<p>“The Cairo royal family has begun to purge people, with Roman Dmitry at the front. As a start, Count Gregory and Count Denver, who have followed the empires, were captured first. Do you think they will get out safely? The moment the nobles collapse, it is all over, and their lives will end. Roman Dmitry will take their lives and control Cairo, and then the empire will not be given the right to break through. So what I’m saying is, let’s use each other. If Kronos shows some mercy, the nobles will bring the royal family to their knees as people of the empire. Later on, when the conquest of the continent is declared, the Cairo Kingdom will be willing to sacrifice itself for Kronos.”</p>
<p>The continental conquest. It was a decision that required sacrifices. However, if Kronos becomes the winner, then only the soldiers would die, and the leaders would stay in power.</p>
<p>And in the end, Benedict put the kingdom up as collateral. For his own survival, Marquis Benedict didn’t hesitate to be a traitor.</p>
<p>“It is a choice that isn’t much different for the Kronos Empire. Gregory to Benedict. The only difference is the people who will give up their lives for the Kronos Empire, and the empire only needs to take the best ones into account.”</p>
<p>[You seem to be talking about yourself highly.]</p>
<p>Baron Charlton grinned.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict could see it. Actually, for the Kronos Empire, it wasn’t that important to invade the kingdom, which was as good as dead. They could come and take it whenever they wanted. It didn’t matter if it was Benedict or Gregory.</p>
<p>[Actually, we are quite disappointed that Count Gregory was caught this time. Although we have supported them until now, they haven’t been able to use the advantage they were given at all. So say it. What do you want Kronos to do for you?]</p>
<p>“Attack the Western Front.”</p>
<p>[Kukuku, did you just ask us to attack your own nation?]</p>
<p>“Yes. In return, only attack the first line. Just give a warning to the royal family as usual to prove that Kronos and the nobles have joined hands. If we show them an aggressive move on the Western Front, they will back down.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t much. Just the mere fact that Kronos has sided with the nobles would give them time to breathe. They would be able to bring in the imperial factions that have turned their heads to the nobles, and once the royal family is threatened, they will no longer attack Benedict.</p>
<p>And if that happens, the royal family would think that the troops in the West are beginning to capture the throne, so it felt like a reasonable plan.</p>
<p>Even during the conflict with the kingdom’s troops, attacking the Western Front wasn’t that difficult for Kronos.</p>
<p>[Fine. I will accept your offer.]</p>
<p>And so the Ministry of Foreign Affairs accepted. It was such an easy matter that it didn’t require the Emperor’s mission. With Baron Charlton’s reply, the small nation of Cairo was going to fall into great chaos.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And twelve hours later, shortly after Kronos accepted the offer, the imperial army invaded the Western Front, and out of the three defense lines, two were pierced.</p>
<p>And unlike usual, the Cairo royal family also caught wind of their movement to attack the third line of defense.</p>
<p>Simon said,</p>
<p>“…. The Kronos Empire is currently regrouping and preparing to attack the third line of defense. Once they break through that line, they will come into Cairo’s estate. Your Majesty, we must somehow stop them at the Western Front.”</p>
<p>The attack was a sudden disaster for no reason. It could be criticized later on, but the disaster was happening right now. And right then…</p>
<p>“A communication request has come in from Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>They couldn’t refuse it. Since the movement of the empire was likely due to the nobles, Daniel Cairo connected the call, and he had a cold look on his face.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict was beyond the screen.</p>
<p>[It’s been a while, Your Majesty.]</p>
<p>“What is this? Regardless of your disadvantage, you are bringing an enemy empire into the fight!”</p>
<p>[We couldn’t help it. Roman Dmitry has put us under pressure to the point of death. Shouldn’t we at least live? Listen carefully now. The nobles joined hands with the Kronos Empire. For that reason, they attacked Cairo at the Western Front today and while you are trying to take down the Benedict Castle, they will make a mess of Cairo.]</p>
<p>His voice was strong. The person who was cornered was speaking with an arrogant voice.</p>
<p>[The Kronos Empire has always wanted the Cairo Kingdom, and this civil war gives them a good reason to capture Cairo. What do you think will change if Roman Dmitry takes Benedict Castle? You need to choose now. Promise to remain the puppet King that you are, and we will end this by amputating the limbs of the King. Well, we will spare the Royal Knights. And if you won’t be too greedy, then maybe Your Majesty the King will live a long life in Cairo. This is our last consideration for you.]</p>
<p>The seat of the King? It never mattered. No matter who was called the King, people knew that Marquis Benedict was the one controlling Cairo. And that was the way for him to live.</p>
<p>The offer to spare the King, rather than pushing the opponent to fight until death, would result in infighting with Dmitry, and that was what he aimed for. While throwing a choice at the indecisive King, he would put the nation into chaos.</p>
<p>[This is a problem that has ended since the moment Kronos stepped in. Your Highness. This is your last chance. Think carefully and make a wise decision.]</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off. Benedict’s face vanished at the one-sided conversation, and Daniel Cairo felt horrible.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Royal Palace Conference Room was silent. If they choose to fight, then the royal family would be destroyed, and if they choose the other option, the forces that followed the royal family, like Dmitry, would be killed.</p>
<p>It was a matter of choice. Marquis Benedict provoked infighting.</p>
<p>Benedict—he was once the King’s maternal uncle. The person who had the same blood as him had now pushed him to the edge of the cliff.</p>
<p>‘My situation is truly miserable.’</p>
<p>The seat of the King—Daniel Cairo never wanted it. It was a reality that was hard to accept since he was born into royalty, and the power he held never meant anything. It was the puppet King’s reality.</p>
<p>With Roman Dmitry’s help, he tried to bring Cairo in the right direction, but Marquis Benedict dragged in a monster the nation couldn’t handle.</p>
<p>What if they had killed him without giving him a choice? Even if he died, Daniel Cairo would have accepted it.</p>
<p>‘I can survive if I abandon Dmitry.’</p>
<p>But what would it mean? If he was going to continue living like a puppet, he would have to move according to what others told him to do.</p>
<p>‘Even if Dmitry defeats the nobles, my power is not guaranteed. Dmitry is a force as strong as the royal family now, and I will stay as a puppet even then. I, Daniel Cairo, am destined to live as a puppet for others. If this is an unavoidable reality, then I want to make a choice for the kingdom, no matter what my life turns into.’</p>
<p>Benedict was a traitor who sold his country. Rather than surviving as his puppet, he at least wanted to see the world that Dmitry was going to show him.</p>
<p>He accepted the reality of his messy life. Even if he had no skills to change this weak nation into a strong one, he trusted and followed his values.</p>
<p>“Simon.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>He had made a choice.</p>
<p>The Cairo royal family.</p>
<p>“Contact Roman Dmitry right now.”</p>
<p>Even if he was called a weak King and remained a puppet, he would never let himself be called a traitor.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 179 - For A Certain End (5)</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry appeared on the screen. As soon as the communication was connected, Daniel Cairo spoke about the situation.</p>
<p>“The nobles’ faction of Marquis Benedict held hands with Kronos. The Western Front has already collapsed until the second line of defense, and at this rate, it seems like it is only a matter of time before the third line of defense will collapse. You realize what this means. The moment the Kronos Empire invades Cairo’s territory, the chaos in Cairo will be further aggravated by the civil war. How should we proceed? Taking down Benedict’s nobles’ faction is important, but we cannot leave the Kronos Empire’s troops alone either.”</p>
<p>In the western part of Cairo, the people who lived there would be in danger. While they settled here to end the civil war, the Kronos Empire could do anything to them.</p>
<p>[If the civil war isn’t settled at once, it will drag on. Marquis Benedict knew this, which is why he brought in the Kronos Empire, and if we retreat now, we’d be going along with his plans.]</p>
<p>“It isn’t like I don’t realize that. However, Marquis Benedict abandoned the Cairo Kingdom. He no longer cares about what will happen to the kingdom, but as the King, I am unable to make a choice like him. They will probably lead this war by helping Kronos invade. And after a day or two, new terrors will come from the West and engulf the people in Cairo.”</p>
<p>It was a dilemma. The position of the kings and nobles was different. If he decided to abandon the people, then his role as the King was useless.</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict urged me to surrender. If I abandon the forces involved in this purge, I get to keep my life and my throne. I declined the offer. It’s not because of my greed to hold power but because I will not be able to avoid sacrificing the people if I become a vassal of Kronos. If so, I will ask this question. What is the most important thing that can help people now? The lives of those in the West also hold the same weight as those in the Capital. Then what should I tell them? Do I tell them to die until the civil war ends? Or would it be much better to set aside the civil war and push out the Kronos Empire now?”</p>
<p>The nobles had been defeated once. If he was satisfied with that and decided to turn his troops around, he could attack Kronos and save the people in the West. But of course, Marquis Benedict would not just leave it there.</p>
<p>Even if it wasn’t like before, he would still surely sell the kingdom. However, from the time he rejected Benedict’s offer, Daniel Cairo didn’t consider holding the power of the royal family important.</p>
<p>For the future of the kingdom, he couldn’t abandon Dmitry, but among the options between Dmitry and the people, he sided with the people. That is who Daniel Cairo was. Even if he was a puppet, he wanted to choose a path for the kingdom to have a chance.</p>
<p>[I know what you mean.]</p>
<p>Roman reacted calmly. He understood him. Roman Dmitry was a man who had to see the end of something if he pulled out his sword.</p>
<p>[Your Highness. From the moment we decided to purge, we knew that the Kronos Empire would cross our border. Whether it’s because of Count Gregory or Marquis Benedict, it doesn’t matter why. Kronos is making fun of us. They have the audacity to attack the Western Front without calling for more troops. What would happen if we left the enemies who had communicated with them safe in the nation? You might think that this is a step back to take one forward later on, but this will only cause twice as many deaths.]</p>
<p>If he had been born in a great time of peace, then Daniel Cairo might have been a good King. But these were turbulent times, and the cruelty of this world was something he had to face.</p>
<p>[The third line of defense on the Western Front is different from the two previous defense lines. And it’s clear that Kronos didn’t use their full force to attack. Trust the captains and commanders of Cairo. If we buy them enough time…]</p>
<p>A King who was emotional—Roman Dmitry didn’t think of it as bad. Because he was so tired of reality, he hoped the King would be someone who thought about the people.</p>
<p>[Within three days, I will clean up the nobles’ faction here and head to the Western Front to stop the Kronos Empire.]</p>
<p>Roman’s words made him go speechless. Even though he thought he couldn’t handle both, Roman Dmitry seemed determined.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. Roman Dmitry…..</p>
<p>“… Fine. Before the third day, make sure to punish those traitors.”</p>
<p>……was the best choice for the Cairo royal family.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The nobles’ final outburst in order to survive was expected. If pushed to the edge of a cliff, Marquis Benedict’s next best option was to attract the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>‘Last week, we slowly drove the nobles into a corner. And if we had stopped there, the civil war would have extended, but now that we made sure to cut off one of their attempts, they are trying to create a way for the fight to end to their advantage.’</p>
<p>On the first day of the siege, Roman Dmitry immediately attacked. Contrary to the force that seemed to indicate that the troops would advance right away, he chose a long-distance attack while taking enough rest.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Was it to minimize the damage?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry moved the troops at night. He had blocked the escape routes from the castle as much as possible and waited until the Magic Defense in the wall reached its limit. For a definite conclusion, he took the necessary steps.</p>
<p>The moment the enemy’s castle loses its defense on their walls, the perfect environment would form and prevent any of them from escaping.</p>
<p>One week was the perfect amount of time for the perfect purge. The enemies were currently thinking that the castle was worth staying in, but Roman Dmitry was already thinking about D-Day.</p>
<p>And tomorrow, as planned, a massive attack on Benedict Castle would begin. But on that evening, Roman Dmitry found an unexpected person.</p>
<p>“Commander. Please put me in as vanguard.”</p>
<p>It was a loud voice.</p>
<p>He was none other than Count Fabius.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Betraying the nobles, Count Fabius joined the King’s side. However, the fact that he wasn’t called for an important meeting at the time didn’t sit right.</p>
<p>‘From what I know, Roman Dmitry is a man who rewards and punishes equally. It means that if I do a good job like his men, then he will not turn a blind eye to my presence.’</p>
<p>After one week, Roman Dmitry finally spoke of a major attack. Once he heard about it, Count Fabius saw it as an opportunity and went to visit Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And then, he said in a loud voice,</p>
<p>“Commander. Please put me in as vanguard.”</p>
<p>The vanguard played a dangerous role. Knowing that his life would be in danger, Count Fabius looked right into Dmitry’s eyes.</p>
<p>Their relationship began as a traitorous one. And in order to immediately make progress in his relationship with him and not lag behind others, he needed to show his blind loyalty and stand in danger.</p>
<p>“I was a member of the nobles. However, I thought that their words were unreasonable, so I refused their summons and chose to follow Roman Dmitry. Give me a chance to prove my loyalty. By serving as the vanguard, I will bring your name to light.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a desperate voice. And at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Smile.</em></p>
<p>Roman smiled. He was an interesting man. He clung here and there like a bat, but he didn’t seem like a bad person to Roman.</p>
<p>‘Strange Demon held a position among the Four Heavenly Kings, and he had this kind of personality too.’</p>
<p>Strange Demon was a peculiar old man. If Crazy Demon represented excessive loyalty to Baek Joong-hyuk and Blood Demon showed the desire to be strong, Strange Demon had changed his Lord three times until he stuck with Baek Joong-hyuk.</p>
<p>If he were an ordinary person, he would have been killed, but he survived until the end and stayed with Baek Joong-hyuk. Baek Joong-hyuk hoped for a mutually beneficial relationship. When Strange Demon abandoned his third master and came to visit him, he gladly accepted the man’s oath of allegiance.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to put a fake face in front of me. Prove your worth with your skills. As long as you prove your use to me, I will not care about what you think.”</p>
<p>Betrayal was an option anyone had, and Baek Joong-hyuk chose to believe in their abilities. He didn’t want blind loyalty from those who followed him, but with his overwhelming skills, he controlled them in a way they wouldn’t betray him.</p>
<p>Strange Demon was the same. If he had betrayed him despite seeing his skills or shown him lesser skills, then he would have had to pay a price, but he didn’t do that. As a result, the monster held a position among the Four Heavenly Kings.</p>
<p>He led the battlefield without Baek Joong-hyuk and brought numerous victories, and his name made everyone tremble. And until the day Baek Joong-hyuk died, the man didn’t betray him.</p>
<p>They had a conversation once, and he said that his mind couldn’t think of betraying the Heavenly Demon at all.</p>
<p>‘Count Fabius.’</p>
<p>He was a traitor to the nobles. In a situation where others would choose to save themselves, he came to the other side and bowed his head.</p>
<p>And he was right. Just as he accepted Viscount Conrad, he didn’t judge him.</p>
<p>“It is dangerous. Can you do it?”</p>
<p>“I can do it! I will devote my life to you!”</p>
<p>His expression brightened, and Count Fabius touched his head.</p>
<p>The heirs of the noble families and the high-ranking nobles. There was a difference in their status too, and yet, despite betraying all of them, there was no shame on his face.</p>
<p>“Sure. Fabius, you will be standing at the forefront of this war.”</p>
<p>Fabius grabbed onto the string of opportunity.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day was bright. The nobles were no different from before. The fact that Kronos had their back made them happy. And it was then…</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>A figure walked towards the wall. A man in a robe.</p>
<p>It was a different development than before. The soldiers on the wall looked doubtful.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>And the man stopped walking as he looked up at the castle’s wall.</p>
<p>‘It’s my turn to repay the Lord’s trust.’</p>
<p>It was Felix. For the entire week, he hadn’t used magic at all. He only led the magicians, who gave power to the Flares with their own little magic, and saved his own power. In the first place, the time he would manifest his power was fixed. When the magicians had sufficiently reduced the durability of the wall’s Magic Defense in front of them, all the preparations were complete, and Felix stepped forward to take his role.</p>
<p><em>Swoosh.</em></p>
<p>The wind blew. As Felix ignited mana, sparks rose around him.</p>
<p>“Summoning Salamander.”</p>
<p><em>Crackle. Crackle.</em></p>
<p>Flames broke out. They wrapped themselves around each other and turned into a monster in the form of fire. It was the elemental magic of the Phoenix Magic Tower. And…</p>
<p>“Burning.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeeik!</em></p>
<p>The magic circle opened, and Felix swallowed Salamander. His entire body was blazing in flames, from his hair down to his legs.</p>
<p>Felix’s teacher always valued the ability to absorb fire. If someone else used Burning, they couldn’t survive Salamander.</p>
<p>“That.”</p>
<p>“Look there!”</p>
<p>There was an uproar on the wall. They couldn’t comprehend the scene in front of them. It wasn’t self-immolation, but they were fascinated by the sight of a man on fire.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p>“Fire Rain.”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>He broke through the boundary of his magic circle. Felix, who was just a 5-circle magician, borrowed Salamander’s power and entered the 6-circle level.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>Roaring!</em></p>
<p>Flames rose everywhere. There were just small sparks at first, but then a dark cloud rose, and the sparks turned into fist-sized balls as they all poured down.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>“Raise your shields!”</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a massacre. The soldiers, who were looking dumbfoundedly at the flames raining down, burned right then, and in an instant, screams spread everywhere.</p>
<p>The soldiers hurriedly tried to hide, but the torrential rain of flames kept them from getting too far away. The walls’ Magic Defense couldn’t block any of the flames, and because the Flares were being used at the same time, the Magic Defense couldn’t save everyone.</p>
<p><em>Pupung!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The Flares and the 6-circle magic—it was a real disaster. People called the Phoenix Magic Tower the best in terms of firepower. However, because the skill to accept fire was quite limited, they couldn’t produce more than two magicians who could use Burning. So Phoenix was rated to be the lowest of the 13 Magic Towers.</p>
<p>And Felix, the new Magic Tower master, succeeded in manifesting Burning.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!!</em></p>
<p>It was like hell. Just one magician and the Flares of five launchers. The walls, which were thought to be indestructible, started to burn, and the soldiers were burned black by the flames.</p>
<p>One week—Roman waited for the right time to fully demonstrate Felix’s power. After mobilizing the Flares to reduce the durability of the Magic Defense, he put an end to the delay.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“The wall has collapsed!”</p>
<p>The Magic Defense on the wall lost its power. They poured more mana stones, but the magic of the 6-circle magician made it reach its limit.</p>
<p>A hole was drilled, and at this point, the walls weren’t so tough anymore. As if welcoming the enemies, it opened wide.</p>
<p>“Soldiers, follow me!”</p>
<p>The Raccoon of Cairo, Count Fabius. He didn’t just give an order; he rode a horse himself.</p>
<p>“Put your lives on the line to punish the traitors!”</p>
<p>“Woahhhhh!”</p>
<p>His cry was the catalyst, and the battlefield was on fire. It was a scene that happened only on the first day of the three days that Roman had promised.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 180 - For A Certain End (6)</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>Arrows flew high in the sky. At the shower of the arrows raining down all at once, Count Fabius tightened the reins of his horse and raised his shield.</p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>The soldiers who were hit by the arrows collapsed. Although they protected themselves with their shields and armor, they weren’t completely safe when hundreds of arrows were raining down at the same time. The arrows pierced their flesh accurately. The soldiers who fell to the ground screamed, but the others didn’t care as they rushed to the wall.</p>
<p>And at the forefront was Fabius. He ran ahead on a war horse, and his heart continued to beat hard when he approached the wall.</p>
<p><em>Thud. Thud.</em></p>
<p>He was no longer young. Like the other nobles, no one would criticize the man for turning back, but he risked his life here. The people of Cairo called Fabius a Raccoon for his ever-changing attitude, but it was his way of life.</p>
<p>Now that he had betrayed Marquis Benedict and followed Dmitry, he would devote himself to Dmitry as if today were his last. It was the same on the Southern Front. He took the risk to prove his worth to everyone.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Flames were continuously falling from the sky, yet he ran through them. He kept moving toward the wall despite the fact that arrows were hitting the knights all around him and screams were echoing.</p>
<p>All his life, he faced many obstacles on the battlefield. And once he made a decision, he followed through with it.</p>
<p>And so…</p>
<p><em>Jump.</em></p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p>He jumped right into the hole in the wall. As soon as the hooves of his horse crushed the enemy, he jumped off his horse and swung his sword like lightning.</p>
<p>Blood splattered. Even though he didn’t possess the strength of an aura swordsman, he still had the power to defeat a single soldier.</p>
<p>At the same time, the other troops arrived. Count Fabius and the knights arrived a little earlier, but in an instant, the walls inside the castle turned into hell.</p>
<p>“Kill those traitors!”</p>
<p>It was the start of a full-blown battle. Count Fabius madly cut down the enemies. The number of enemies didn’t show any signs of decreasing no matter how many times he cut, and he started to run out of breath even though he had only swung the sword a couple of times. And because he had lived in the peaceful capital and since he was no longer young, he wasn’t able to maintain his momentum as fast as when he first entered the battlefield, but….</p>
<p>‘Haste.’</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>He used a relic, and soon a blue light spread over his body as he passed through the battle with agile movements that didn’t match his age.</p>
<p>Fabius wasn’t some stupid man to put his life in danger. If he had been hit by an arrow, the shield spell engraved on his armor would have activated, and in order to survive on the chaotic battlefield, he purchased buff-type relics in large numbers.</p>
<p>It was true that he risked his life as a vanguard, but that was only after he increased the chances of survival as much as possible.</p>
<p>Performance was a necessary element. Count Fabius was the type of person who wanted to be recognized for his accomplishments.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>He cut the throats of his enemies. He had already killed ten people. He had a hard time because he couldn’t cut their necks open quickly, probably because he was weak.</p>
<p><em>“Huak, huak.”</em></p>
<p>He gasped for air. His role was over. He couldn’t get himself to run any further. In this land that had turned into hell with people dying here and there, Count Fabius didn’t rush any further.</p>
<p>Anyway, from now on, he could no longer do much for the battle. Since he had properly fulfilled his role as the vanguard, he focused on calming his rapidly rising breath while paying attention to his surroundings. And…</p>
<p>‘From now, it is Roman Dmitry’s time.’</p>
<p>Fabius witnessed it.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—he was slaughtering the enemies who were behind him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The role of a vanguard. It wasn’t a matter that he could fully entrust to Fabius. Roman Dmitry had always been the vanguard on the battlefield, and that wouldn’t change now.</p>
<p>And so Roman Dmitry appeared right behind Fabius. Seeing the massacre begin as soon as he entered the battlefield, the soldiers of the nobles’ faction screamed at the top of their lungs.</p>
<p>“Stop him!”</p>
<p>“It is Roman Dmitry!”</p>
<p>“Cairo’s Devil has appeared! Kill him by any means!”</p>
<p>In this hell, the demons revealed their murderous intent to Roman Dmitry. All the nearby soldiers rushed for Roman Dmitry, hoping to take him down with the numerical advantage they had.</p>
<p>But the results were different. In the blink of an eye, the bodies of those who Roman Dmitry came across were torn to pieces, and blood and death followed.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuaaak!”</em></p>
<p>The battlefield was mixed up with different people. It was impossible to properly grasp the situation from a distance, but blood was surely splattered everywhere, and the soldiers on the nobles’ side screamed.</p>
<p>In an instant, Roman Dmitry bathed in blood.</p>
<p>Even though he was covered in bright red blood, he didn’t slow down and continued moving forward without any care. Hostility was present everywhere. If he cut down the enemy in front of him, other enemies would come from both sides.</p>
<p>Before being killed by the devil, they wanted to somehow hurt him, but they only suffered in pain. Their bodies heated up, and when they came to their senses, they all had missing body parts.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming kill; it was one-sided. The enemies surrounded Roman Dmitry just like a pack of wolves unleashed on a sheep, but they all died in agony.</p>
<p>And the path was now open. They had no choice but to give way. The people who stood in his way all died, and their bodies paved a path.</p>
<p>How far did he go? Only Roman Dmitry could be seen in the enemy’s camp. There were others following him, but they were not able to break through the enemy lines as quickly as Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p>“Now! Everyone attack!”</p>
<p>The captain of the guards of Benedict Castle shouted.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>During the series of events, Cameron witnessed Roman Dmitry’s overwhelming power. As if a natural disaster suddenly unfolded, they couldn’t dare fight against this monstrous being as humans.</p>
<p>‘This is Cairo’s Devil.’</p>
<p>Goosebumps rose. Even after the Hector Kingdom captured the Southern Front, they seemed to understand why they were defeated just because of Roman Dmitry. With a monster like him shaking everything inside of them, how could they withstand it?</p>
<p>Cameron did not dare deal with Roman, but he had no intention of stepping down.</p>
<p>‘We even took into account the possibility of Roman Dmitry crossing the wall. Cairo’s best sword, Roman Dmitry, with his belligerent tendencies, will surely overdo it, and that is our chance to deal with him.’</p>
<p>So he waited for the right time and the perfect chance.</p>
<p>As Roman Dmitry pulled away from his allies, Cameron appeared.</p>
<p>“Now! Everyone attack!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura rose from all sides, and it was only because of a single enemy. The nobles recruited all of the remaining aura swordsmen from their families.</p>
<p>Their only goal was Roman Dmitry. They, who held their positions even when Count Fabius climbed over the wall and devastated the castle, rushed at Cameron’s command.</p>
<p>One hundred swordsmen—it was an overwhelming sight. And they simultaneously began to use their auras to attack Roman Dmitry. But….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The first one. The swordsman who rushed forward was split into two. His sword, which shone lightly with aura, slowly lost its light, and the man’s eyes went wide, unable to accept that he was cut down without even swinging his sword.</p>
<p>And it was just the beginning. Various forms of aura exploded and attacked Roman Dmitry, but they all coughed up blood and flew back.</p>
<p>With just one attack, the aura swordsmen had been swept away. It was the same with the 1-star aura swordsmen and the 3-star ones. Everyone was now scared, and they all lost their confidence to win.</p>
<p>There was something strange about it. Obviously, the number of people reaching one hundred should guarantee an overwhelming victory, but as time went on, the existence of aura didn’t seem to have such a meaning.</p>
<p>Both for the normal soldiers and the aura swordsmen, the results were not different. Before anyone could do anything, their necks were slashed with a sword clad in aura.</p>
<p><em>Crush.</em></p>
<p>A fist slammed into a man’s face, and he collapsed.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t seem like he would stop anytime soon. He didn’t just want to win this war. In the process of punishing the traitors, he wanted to showcase how Dmitry chooses to treat his enemies so that no one would do the same thing again. Roman Dmitry made his presence known. After taking down a hundred swordsmen, he slaughtered them as if they were normal soldiers.</p>
<p>“…N-No way.”</p>
<p>Cameron was shocked.</p>
<p>The one hundred swordsmen—the nobles’ faction were all smiles as they hired them. No matter how strong Roman Dmitry was, they were sure that so many people could handle him.</p>
<p>But what was this? It wasn’t human power. Roman Dmitry was a type of being that hadn’t been found in Cairo before.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Another life was lost.</p>
<p>They didn’t know anything about Cairo’s Devil. The swordsman, in his own way, was a person who was called the most powerful swordsman among a hundred. Looking at the corpses, his eyes were wide open, unable to accept the reality, and Cameron backed away.</p>
<p>It was over. The wall fell. And subduing Roman Dmitry in combat didn’t make any sense.</p>
<p>‘I need to inform the commander.’</p>
<p>He turned around. There were many soldiers waiting on the battlefield for his orders, but Cameron just left them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The head of the nobles’ faction was in a safe place. While the nobles waited for the results with anxious faces, they finally received an audio communication from the castle’s walls.</p>
<p>[I-It is a huge deal!]</p>
<p>It was Cameron.</p>
<p>In a terrified voice, Cameron told him the grim reality.</p>
<p>[The wall has been completely breached. The Magic Defense has lost its function, and it is only a matter of time before the castle’s walls are taken over by them. In particular, there is no way to stop Roman Dmitry. All the aura swordsmen that the noble families sent suffered a one-sided annihilation.]</p>
<p>“… this.”</p>
<p>Beyond the device was Marquis Benedict, who looked so pale.</p>
<p>He felt dizzy.</p>
<p>Obviously, even the day before, they were hoping for a pink future with the support of the Kronos Empire, but now the Benedict Castle, which was called an iron castle, didn’t last even for a single day.</p>
<p>Fighting to the death here was madness. Knowing that, the leaders of the nobles faction did not even go near the castle walls in the first place.</p>
<p>[Hurry and run… <em>kuak!</em>]</p>
<p>A scream of death made Marquis Benedict hesitate. He felt goosebumps. The sound of a person’s life ending meant that someone killed Cameron.</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict.]</p>
<p>A familiar voice. Roman Dmitry followed through and grabbed the communication device with bloodstained hands.</p>
<p>[In the past week, you have committed an atrocity that threatens the safety of the nation. You tried to mobilize the nobles to attack Dmitry and then draw them in for rebellion, which eventually forced the Kronos Empire to intervene in the civil war. I think there are degrees of mistakes you did, and what you have done cannot be put aside anymore.]</p>
<p>It was cold. Even when no one responded, Roman didn’t stop talking.</p>
<p>[It is obvious to me. You will not be allowed to keep your life. So keep fighting until the end. On your knees, bowing your head, crying out the sins you committed from your mouth, and bursting into tears. I will punish all of you and your family members for treason.]</p>
<p>Between his words, the time to breathe felt like an eternity. They all held their breaths. They didn’t want Roman Dmitry to know that they were on the other side.</p>
<p>[We will meet soon.]</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off, and their hearts sank. A message was left by a one-sided call. The nobles, including Benedict, couldn’t take their eyes off the device with frightened expressions.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 181 - For A Certain End (7)</p>
<p>His hands felt weak. Watching the device fall to the ground and break, Marquis Benedict’s mind sank into the abyss.</p>
<p>‘… just where did we go wrong?’</p>
<p>He began to look back. Right after the Ranking Matches, Marquis Benedict led a group of nobles to visit Roman Dmitry and forced him to make a choice. As a result, a full-fledged fight began, but he didn’t think it was the wrong choice. It was something he had been working on for over a year.</p>
<p>But the man said he would take an independent route and be alone, and they knew that leaving him alone to grow would weaken the power they held. He wanted to cut Roman down before he grew stronger. It was obviously the right decision, and Roman Dmitry drew his sword too.</p>
<p>Could it be that attacking the man was a mistake? If he held the troops in Benedict and didn’t send them to the Dmitry estate, then maybe the castle wouldn’t have collapsed.</p>
<p>No, on second thought, that didn’t seem like the case. Even with so many troops, Baron Winston wasn’t able to defeat the Dmitry estate. The difference in their power was too great in the first place.</p>
<p>Looking back at his choices, Marquis Benedict could come to one conclusion.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry made all my plans meaningless.’</p>
<p>Think about it. Whether it was his plan in Cairo or the Benedict Castle’s divide and conquer, these operations should not have failed. That was the power of being objective. It was the natural result when he brought in the best swordsmen to fight. But they couldn’t even get the job done. When Roman Dmitry was slaughtering all of them alone, it made his head spin.</p>
<p>The power the man held was the reason for the failure. Just as the Cairo Kingdom did not dare look at the empires, the nobles chose the wrong opponent in the first place. It was the end.</p>
<p>Looking at the broken communication device, Marquis Benedict was frightened.</p>
<p>‘If we stay like this, death cannot be avoided.’</p>
<p>Cairo’s Devil was chasing him. Marquis Benedict came to his senses and spoke in an urgent voice.</p>
<p>“The siege warfare at the castle is a failure. We have to avoid this place for now and borrow the power of the Kronos Empire to reverse the situation. Move fast. If we are captured like this, the future of the nobles is over.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The nobles nodded with pale expressions.</p>
<p>There were still soldiers left at Benedict Castle. They risked their lives here for the nobles, yet the leaders didn’t even care about them. After all, they were just collateral. As long as they could save their own lives and use Kronos to get power, they could secure more people. So they moved quickly.</p>
<p>Fortunately, a secret passage was created for such situations. Since they had a way to escape unnoticed, they still had a spark of hope in this situation.</p>
<p>How long did they run? They were out of breath.</p>
<p>Their bodies were weighed down by the armor they wore for no reason, and their foreheads were drenched in sweat. Normally, such things would have annoyed the nobles.</p>
<p>Thinking that just one second of delay would give the devil a chance to kill them, they continued to rush forward.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached the end. They saw a bright light for the first time after passing through the dark passage, but Marquis Benedict, who was in the lead, had a pale expression.</p>
<p><em>Drop. Drop.</em></p>
<p>The sound of blood dripping from a sword.</p>
<p>A man was using a corpse as a chair. And confirming it was Marquis Benedict, he stood up with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>“You are too late, Marquis Benedict.”</p>
<p>He was Kevin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Benedict’s choice was so obvious. If he failed in the war, everyone knew he wouldn’t take the risk to stay and die.</p>
<p>Last week, they had perfectly grasped the secret passages. Kevin and the other soldiers were guarding one of them. And the Marquis appeared right where Kevin was.</p>
<p>It felt like his last hope had been crushed. His face still had a youthful look, but Benedict knew how terrifying Kevin was.</p>
<p>‘Dmitry’s demon…!’</p>
<p>At Roman’s command, two swordsmen rushed forward. Kevin was one of them, and he still couldn’t forget the sight of him rushing at hundreds of troops. He gulped and hurriedly hid behind the escorts who followed him and shouted in a terrified voice,</p>
<p>“Attack now! I want you to kill them!”</p>
<p>The escort knights were also clearly frightened. They exchanged hesitant glances for a moment, but they couldn’t refuse Marquis Benedict’s order.</p>
<p>Kevin didn’t move an inch when he saw them. And seeing him just staring at them made the knights grit their teeth.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“Kill him!”</p>
<p>Dozens of knights risked their lives. With faces that suppressed their fear, they swung their swords at Kevin, looking like they would burst into tears at any moment. And…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>A throat was cut open. Blood splashed with every move of his sword. And Kevin avoided the attacks that came in from all directions through the narrow gaps.</p>
<p>One sword cut his fluttering hair, but Kevin, without even blinking an eye, used his short stature to shove his sword into the opponent’s chin.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“Uhhh.”</p>
<p>The knight choked on his own blood. The opponent’s eyes were white, and he collapsed, scattering dust on the ground.</p>
<p>Just one swordsman. Only Kevin moved. There were other soldiers behind him, but they all just watched Kevin fight.</p>
<p>It was a scene that made them go stiff. The escort knights desperately attacked Kevin, but they were helpless as their body parts were cut off one by one. And when he swung his sword with his right hand, the arms of the opponent blocking him were cut off. And when the knight turned to run away with a scared face, Kevin jumped to cut his throat.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s demon. He was exactly as the rumors claimed. As the blood flowed in streams, the nobles, including Marquis Benedict, fled without looking back. After all, the escort knights were just collateral.</p>
<p>He looked at the nobles with anger in his eyes, but the nobles only grew farther away from him. However, Kevin didn’t go after the nobles. He only stopped the breath of the knights who were left behind. Because Marquis Benedict was nothing more than a cornered rat.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>“Huak, huak.”</em></p>
<p>Marquis Benedict gasped. The soldiers and the knights were abandoned. He didn’t think he was a coward. Since they existed for their well-being, he didn’t feel the slightest sense of guilt while running away.</p>
<p>The problem was…</p>
<p>“This fucking…!”</p>
<p>As they retreated, another being held them back. It was Chris. Roman Dmitry’s men didn’t participate in the siege.</p>
<p>Knowing that the moment the castle would collapse, the opponent would collapse as well. Hence, they were given a special order, and they completely blocked the way for Marquis Benedict to escape.</p>
<p>In this war, not a single person involved in the rebellion would be spared. And he knew that the way he would deal with them would remain a mark for the future.</p>
<p>“Where are you going so quickly?”</p>
<p>Chris stepped forward, and Marquis Benedict hurriedly turned around. Seeing them flee in the other direction, Chris captured the other nobles, leaving Marquis Benedict alone.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuaaak!”</em></p>
<p>There was a scream. Chris killed a noble on the spot. He stabbed his sword slowly to make him scream more, and Marquis Benedict covered his ears as he ran away.</p>
<p>It felt like he was losing his sanity. It was hard for him to accept that he, who once had great power, was now afraid.</p>
<p>Wherever he went, there was a subordinate of Roman. At first, many nobles followed him, but then one by one, they continued to die.</p>
<p>And now his face was covered with tears and snot. But he continued to run by thinking,</p>
<p>‘Right, play with me how much you want. If I manage to get out of here alive, I will definitely avenge what happened here, regardless of whether I side with Kronos or not. And at that time, even if you beg to be spared, I will rip out your limbs and kill all those who followed you.’</p>
<p>The desire to survive fueled his thoughts of revenge. His feet were swollen, and his toenails were broken. He got scars on his body while running through all sorts of things, but he didn’t care. And after running for a long time, there was hope in his eyes.</p>
<p>‘Here.’</p>
<p>There was a small gap under a rock. The animal feces around it gave off a terrible smell, but saving his life was more important now, so he didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>He hid under the rock and dragged himself, with animal feces smearing all over his body. He held his breath, unable to breathe in the air. He would do anything just to live. And Marquis Benedict’s desire to live burned stronger than ever.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The sun had gone down. The night had never been so long. Even though he was trembling from hunger and cold, he shut his mouth when he heard some people nearby.</p>
<p>“Huh.”</p>
<p>Roman’s men were roaming everywhere. It seemed like they were checking the surroundings to find him, but they didn’t seem to think of checking the place where there were animal feces.</p>
<p>Marquis Benedict was the symbol of power. Even if his life was at stake, he never thought he would do such a thing.</p>
<p>Tears trickled down. He was used to this smell, but the situation he was in felt miserable.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry—it is all because of him. Cairo’s throne was right in front of me, but then he ruined everything. I will not fall, I will survive and claim the throne.’</p>
<p>He shuddered. His consciousness was starting to fade, but he forcibly endured all of this.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>“… Marquis Benedict. It is all over. Come out now.”</p>
<p>It was a familiar voice. It was Viscount Owen’s. And hearing his voice, Marquis Benedict almost screamed out, but then he covered his mouth.</p>
<p>It was a clear attempt to use the prisoners to locate him. If that wasn’t the reason, wasn’t it enough to just pull him out?</p>
<p>“The Benedict Castle has been captured, all the nobles’ troops have been captured, and not a single one of the leaders managed to escape. We are done, Marquis. Your family was also dragged out and is now pleading for their lives. So please convince Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>His voice was desperate. At first, his voice was far away, but now it is closer.</p>
<p>“You don’t even know, Marquis. There is no way to escape from here. Roman blocked all the routes, expecting us to flee from the start. Didn’t you feel that when running away? We are being played with. That means there was no way to escape in the first place.”</p>
<p>His blood went cold. Those words seemed to indicate that he knew where he was.</p>
<p>At that moment, along with the movement of a human being, a new voice filled his ears,</p>
<p>“Hey! You bastard! Do you think people don’t know you are hiding there? You said you would spare my life if I showed the way, but now you are acting selfishly until the very end. Please just go to hell… <em>kuak</em>!”</p>
<p>The sound of death made him go pale. And then he knew—his position was discovered right from the start, but Roman Dmitry just let him stay there.</p>
<p>Blood spilled on the floor. The blood that flowed from Viscount Owen soaked Marquis Benedict’s clothes.</p>
<p>And….</p>
<p>“Come out.”</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry’s voice.</p>
<p>As his heart sank, Marquis Benedict tightly closed his eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 182 - For A Certain End (8)</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>“Walk quickly.”</p>
<p>A hard object was pushed onto Marquis Benedict’s back. He walked along the path missing one of his shoes, with his hair all messed up and with a miserable appearance.</p>
<p>Running through the bushes, the soles of his feet were torn. His feet were in pain, but as soon as he arrived at Benedict Castle, he couldn’t help but raise his head as all eyes focused on him from all directions.</p>
<p>“Marquis Benedict!”</p>
<p>“Fucking trash!”</p>
<p>“Look at who ran away alone!”</p>
<p>They were the soldiers of the nobles’ faction. Those who tried to defend Benedict Castle until the end were captured. Actually, the war shouldn’t have ended like this.</p>
<p>They fought until the end, even after Roman Dmitry appeared, but at some point, they realized that something was strange—no one was giving orders.</p>
<p>Obviously, Cameron was shouting from the walls, but soon he disappeared, and the nobles’ faction, including Marquis Benedict, never showed themselves the entire time. The moment their trust collapsed, the war ended. One by one, they threw away their weapons and expressed their intentions to surrender, and such feelings quickly spread everywhere.</p>
<p>This war was a civil war that was happening in their kingdom. It was a war that happened according to the cause of the leaders who led the soldiers, but since their leaders had fled, they no longer had any reason to fight.</p>
<p>The balance had collapsed. The kingdom’s troops arrested all the soldiers who had lost their hostility and looked inside the castle until the day was over, blocking any unknown variables.</p>
<p>It was all over, and the victors were the troops of the kingdom.</p>
<p>And at the sight of Marquis Benedict being dragged out, the prisoners spat curses at him.</p>
<p><em>“Ptooey!”</em></p>
<p>“Go to hell!”</p>
<p>The saliva hit his face and dripped to the floor, and this made Marquis Benedict’s stomach boil. His body was already smeared with animal feces. In addition, he couldn’t accept this situation where the nobles were being punished by mere soldiers, and the most powerful person in Cairo was being manhandled.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>He got down on his knees right in the center of the square. All eyes focused on him, and he raised his head, watching Roman Dmitry approach him.</p>
<p>‘… This is how I will die.’</p>
<p>At that moment, Marquis Benedict’s mind drifted into his past memories, which he had forgotten.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Decades ago, a grand banquet was held in Cairo. At the marriage between the Cairo royal family and the most prestigious Benedict family, envoys from many nations sent their best wishes and blessings.</p>
<p>And Marquis Benedict was also there. Having inherited the estate from his father at such a young age, he couldn’t hide his delight at the marriage of his younger sister, whom he looked after like a father. From that day on, he was really happy.</p>
<p>It was Daniel Cairo’s father. Even at that time, the former King was known to be incompetent.</p>
<p>“The actions of the Kronos Empire are becoming worse with each passing day. They invade our borders at any opportunity they get, and even within the kingdom, they interfere with our state affairs! Your Majesty. Cairo is powerless now. I know very well that we have no other choice but to watch them do this, but that doesn’t mean we should just suffer like this. We need to set an example of our power. We need to prove Cairo’s will by cutting down the heads of the spies.”</p>
<p>Many people were dying at the Western Front, and Marquis Benedict visited the royal palace with rage and spoke loudly, wanting some results. And at that time, Benedict was a patriot.</p>
<p>Thinking that the Benedict family and the Cairo royal family were one and the same, he couldn’t bear to watch the Kronos Empire looking down on the kingdom.</p>
<p>But the King didn’t do anything. The reason was simple. He couldn’t put more people in danger. The King decided that he couldn’t handle the loss of life from a retaliation that wouldn’t bear any results.</p>
<p>It was said that loving the people was a virtue of the King, but it didn’t seem like that to Marquis Benedict. He was just standing aside when such things were happening. Looking far into the future, it was clear that many people’s lives would be lost.</p>
<p>However, the King pushed for peace more than power, and for him, it was ideal not to fight back. And from then on, Cairo’s power began to collapse.</p>
<p>As the King remained indecisive and delayed his judgments, the Kronos Empire and the Valhalla Empire managed to increase their powers. And to oppose them, Marquis Benedict gathered forces. Even if the Cairo royal family was being foolish, he wasn’t going to give up.</p>
<p>And around that time, something happened. The Queen, who was weak, fell ill and died. It was the same disease as Marquis Benedict’s father. At that moment, all the ties he had with the royal family collapsed, and he watched his sister’s funeral with a cold expression and questioned if the King was right.</p>
<p>The queen’s position was one of honor, yet the empires laughed at them. Their expressions were devoid of sadness, which fueled Marquis Benedict’s rage.</p>
<p>“I can no longer trust the Cairo royal family. I will set up an independent force that represents Cairo and lead it down the right path. Tell this to the nobles who wish to follow me. ‘If you intend to follow me, ‘Benedict,’ rather than the Cairo royal family, come and pledge allegiance to me on the appointed date.’”</p>
<p>And that was how the nobles’ faction was formed. He couldn’t trust the King who only spoke ideal words, and Daniel Cairo, their only heir, was too young. The kingdom held no future.</p>
<p>Later on in the history of Cairo, even if he would be labeled insane for power, he believed that his decision was correct.</p>
<p>And then the previous King died.</p>
<p>With the result that everyone hoped for, Marquis Benedict took the throne.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The execution of his death. He wanted to face his end as calmly as possible, but the memories of that time made him cry.</p>
<p>It was unfair. What did he do wrong? Even though he could have given up the kingdom at any time, he did his best to maintain the Cairo Kingdom. And although he didn’t follow the royal family, he also did things for the sake of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Right in front of him, Roman stopped walking. Seeing his gaze coldly looking down with his sword, Marquis Benedict raised his face and shouted,</p>
<p>“I-I am not wrong. I have been devoted to the nation, and here you are, trying to kill me! Cairo’s former King clearly had the chance to deal with the forces of the empires, but he didn’t, and that caused the deaths of the people. If this world were heaven, where blood and death aren’t allowed, he would have been a King that the people would admire, but that is not the reality. While the weak King ruined the nation, I held the balance so Cairo wouldn’t collapse!”</p>
<p>He yelled out loud. He was desperate. He wanted to release his accumulated emotions, regardless of how others perceived him.</p>
<p>“The previous King died. Daniel Cairo ascended the throne, spouting absurd remarks about creating a nation where the people are happy. Roman Dmitry. Can you sincerely serve such a King? If you’re making cold judgments like you always do, you should understand how I feel. The Kronos Empire crossed the border too many times, and we are now infested with spies from other nations, and then the Hector Kingdom declared war on us. That is Cairo. Then, shouldn’t the person who takes the throne be strong enough to protect the kingdom from all of this chaos? Try answering me. Tell me I am wrong!”</p>
<p>He succumbed to evil. His eyes were red, and it felt like tears of blood were flowing down from them.</p>
<p>Roman looked calm. Looking at Marquis Benedict’s figure, who insisted that he was right, brought back their past interactions.</p>
<p>“I will not criticize the choice you made. As you said, Cairo had the chance to set things right.”</p>
<p>But….</p>
<p>“I will not say that the choice of the former King was wrong. If you had led the nobles’ faction and made Cairo stronger, you would have had the right to criticize him for not drawing his sword at a better time, but look at these results. What did you do? Despite forming a faction, the power system remained the same, and when Hector crossed the border you didn’t think about the safety of the nation. You only cared about your power, and the cause you speak of has lost its meaning. And when you were on the verge of being defeated, you joined hands with the Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>He pointed his sword, and Marquis Benedict didn’t avert his gaze. Even at the moment of his death, he spoke about how unfair things were.</p>
<p>“It is not shameful for the powerless to bow their heads. If the King had not taken responsibility for that decision, he would have had to bear the weight of countless lives. You cannot blame him. I can tell even looking at it now. When you put yourself in the position of a decision-maker, you will realize that you have become more of a scumbag than the person you are blaming. Even though the royal family is criticized for being incompetent and the royal family’s existence has been completely denied, they never made the choice to sell the nation.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Marquis Benedict’s eyes wavered. He felt he was wrong. He understood what Roman’s words meant. He crawled on his knees and grabbed onto Roman’s legs.</p>
<p>“… please, please let me live. I wanted people to realize my hard work. From now on, I will do my very best for the Cairo royal family—no, for Dmitry. So please spare me.”</p>
<p>In his miserable state, he pleaded. His face was determined not to die, and Roman said,</p>
<p>“No, from the moment you drew your sword against me in Cairos, I was prepared for what to do if I lost the war—after Dmitry was burned, my family would have been made fun of. You started this war. This is a fight that only ends when one side dies. It doesn’t matter whose side is right. The loser takes all the blame for the war. Benedict, I’ll show everyone that you were wrong.”</p>
<p>“Please, just this…”</p>
<p>“Cairo will remember this day.”</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>And his sword moved as everyone gasped. Some stared straight ahead with their eyes wide open, some averted their gaze, and some were shocked.</p>
<p>This was the price of rebellion. Roman’s sword cut off Marquis Benedict’s head.</p>
<p><em>Drip.</em></p>
<p>His head rolled down on the ground, and his body thumped down.</p>
<p>The giant of Cairo—it was the end of Marquis Benedict, who was once called a living power.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time passed slowly for the Cairo royal family. Daniel Cairo couldn’t accept that the fate of the nation rested on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘The first day of the three days had passed. If we take a long time to subdue the nobles, the chances of Kronos invading us through the Western Front will increase. Did I make the right choice? If I had reached a compromise at the right time, the people of Cairo would not have had to face a war.’</p>
<p>He pondered over the same thing and began to envy people like Roman Dmitry. A man like him couldn’t shake off the thoughts of whether his decision was right or wrong.</p>
<p>And then he opened his eyes. He sat on his throne with a straight back, and he was determined not to doubt his choice as much as possible. His own father was a good person. But he didn’t want to be a good person like him. It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! We won! It is said that Roman Dmitry has captured the Benedict Castle!”</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>He jumped up and left his chair.</p>
<p>Just one day, one day to take down a castle. His entire body felt tremors of joy as Roman Dmitry turned his words into reality.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was surely a monster Cairo couldn’t handle, and in the future, in order to move with the monster, he would have to give up his meek actions.</p>
<p>But still, he felt good. He didn’t mind the life of a puppet as long as he could lead Cairo in the right direction. This feeling of happiness was good enough.</p>
<p>“Congratulations on the major achievement, and those who did this will be rewarded. Order them to move to the Western Front at once. The movement of the Kronos Empire is odd, and late reactions will bring horrible consequences.”</p>
<p>He suppressed his joy.</p>
<p>Although the civil war was settled, Cairo’s peace was not yet guaranteed.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 183 - Current Life’s Relationship (1)</p>
<p>On the day before the fall of the Benedict Castle, Count Vandenberg, the commander of the Western Front, received a report that disrupted the peace in Cairo.</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire has crossed the borders! The first line of defense has been breached, and they are leading their troops to the second line of defense. Commander, please give us your order. It is only a matter of time before the second line of defense is broken!”</p>
<p>He received a report from his subordinate. There has been a civil war in Cairo for the last few days. Daniel Cairo raised his troops to suppress the rebellion, but none of the troops on the Western Front were summoned because there was an evil force that existed beyond the West.</p>
<p>And since no one knew when the Kronos Empire might invade the borders, they put up a minimum safety net. The first line of defense was nothing more than a temporary defensive position.</p>
<p>In fact, they had the role of a scout to report the invasion of their enemies, and from the second line of defense, supplies for a battle were prepared.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg said,</p>
<p>“Call the troops right now! Cairo is in chaos due to the civil war. Under the current situation, if the Kronos Empire steps into our land, the chaos will be out of control.”</p>
<p>It was the best decision that their enemies could make. The third line of defense was their last resort, so they needed to win at least one battle in the second line of defense.</p>
<p>And right then….</p>
<p>“No. We have to abandon the second line of defense and retreat with the troops.”</p>
<p>It was the end of the meeting. One of the staff on the Western Front spoke up, and Count Vandenberg asked,</p>
<p>“Flora, what do you mean?”</p>
<p>It was Flora Lawrence, and everyone turned to her.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The odd one on the Western Front—Flora was a celebrity in the West. After she left her family, she entered the Royal Academy and studied tactics. Then she suddenly announced her intention to volunteer on the Western Front, and the capital was in uproar because of it.</p>
<p>It was an unusual request, and she was not just any ordinary woman but the daughter of a noble family, so the opinions were divided. In the end, they left the decision to Flora’s father.</p>
<p>Viscount Lawrence, who heard of his daughter’s decision, sent a message saying that he believed in her.</p>
<p>It was the first time it happened in Cairo. There had never been a case where a woman from a noble family with a great future wanted to head into war, and many didn’t like it. Sometimes, there were such people.</p>
<p>Because some people had the choice, they could head to the battlefield for the sake of experience and not risk their lives. So there was a lot of prejudice. The people in the West rejected Flora, but it only took less than a month for that perception to change.</p>
<p>And what she had shown thus far had made the Count willingly listen to her.</p>
<p>“Flora. What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire has periodically invaded Cairo’s borders. They were meant to be a warning, but they didn’t genuinely intend to capture Cairo. But it’s different this time. Civil war broke out inside Cairo, and Marquis Benedict was reportedly cornered. The situation is quite tricky, and I think the Kronos Empire’s attack has something to do with the civil war.”</p>
<p>“… you mean, the Kronos Empire has joined sides with Marquis Benedict?”</p>
<p>“I am not sure who it is, but it might be because of Count Gregory, who is imprisoned, or it might also be because of Marquis Benedict, who requested for help. What is certain is that the Kronos Empire invaded the borders despite the conflict within the kingdom. Therefore, we shouldn’t be overlooking this situation.”</p>
<p>The room was in chaos. Flora’s words meant that the Kronos Empire was involved in the civil war.</p>
<p>In this unusual situation, one person asked,</p>
<p>“Flora. If so, isn’t it more important to stop the Kronos Empire at the second line of defense? War is a crucial thing, and we need to hold the lead. If we withdraw right now, then we will have to give up a lot of war resources.”</p>
<p>“Yes, right. Under normal circumstances, it makes no sense to abandon the second line of defense. However, if Kronos has decided to use the civil war for their motives, then their goal is to pass through the third line of defense at all costs and invade Cairo. In addition, with the kingdom dealing with the rebellious forces, if they don’t have supporting troops to spare, then the worst situation awaits us since we have to deal with the Kronos Empire all on our own. We cannot always have the best option, and the fate of Cairo is at stake this time, so we must filter out the worst and best options.”</p>
<p>Flora added strength to her voice. Ever since she was assigned to the West, she had proven her merit on the battlefield. And the moment people fully embraced her, regardless of her gender or status, Flora Lawrence turned into a key member.</p>
<p>Therefore, Flora’s advice couldn’t be overlooked.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg was silent. After thinking for a long time, he made a decision.</p>
<p>“Flora is right. Order the troops in the second line to retreat. In case the worst happens, we will prepare for a war against Kronos in the third line of defense.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation was as they had expected. The Kronos Empire wasn’t satisfied with the second line of defense. They marched beyond that place, and soon after, the troops received a call from the Cairo royal family.</p>
<p>[Marquis Benedict colluded with the Kronos Empire. They intend to break the third line of defense and directly attack Cairo, and the kingdom’s forces need time to sort out the rebellion that is happening. Hold on for three days. If you can endure that much, I will quickly organize the troops and send reinforcements to the Western Front.]</p>
<p>After receiving the message from the royal family, a meeting was called. As the heads of the Western Front gathered together, Baron Noel, the head of the staff, spoke.</p>
<p>“His Majesty promised us three days. But common sense tells us that it is impossible to quell a rebellion in three days. Marquis Benedict has been preparing for a rebellion for a long time, and from what we know, his castle has all the preparations needed for a war. Although the commander leading them is Roman Dmitry, who had defeated the Hector Kingdom, we need to prepare something.”</p>
<p>“Right. Besides, even if they manage to subdue the rebellion, it will take them some time to move. Even if they used the warp gate, it will take them a day to arrive, so does it make sense for them to clean up Benedict Castle in one day?”</p>
<p>Everyone felt negative about it. The West and Benedict—since they had warp gates, there was no need to travel long distances on foot. But even taking those advantages into account, it felt like three days were too short.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg said,</p>
<p>“You are right. If we really don’t want the Kronos Empire to invade us, then we need to secure war materials as fast as we can and prepare to defend. In the worst case, the army of the kingdom might be unable to clean up the rebellious forces, and in the end, it means we will have to overcome this crisis on our own.”</p>
<p>“I have different thoughts.”</p>
<p>A beautiful voice. It was Flora who spoke this time.</p>
<p>Baron Noel asked,</p>
<p>“You think differently? Do you think the troops of the kingdom will clean them up in three days?”</p>
<p>“I also think three days is tight, but His Majesty said that he gave a 3-day deadline to Roman Dmitry. Then, there is a good chance that it won’t last longer than five days at the most. They will likely capture the rebels in three days, and given their travel time, they will arrive in five days.”</p>
<p>“How can you be that sure?”</p>
<p>“I think everyone is familiar with the relationship between Dmitry and Lawrence. Roman Dmitry is a man who makes the best of the worst situations. From the moment he took down Barco with Lawrence, I knew that he wasn’t a person who could be judged according to common sense. And such a being said three days, so I trust him.”</p>
<p>The people on the Western Front weren’t incompetent. Each of them had their own strengths, and as long as they could protect this place, Flora thought they could change the situation.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. She experienced his power firsthand. Even with the absurd time they were given, she trusted Roman Dmitry, but Baron Noel was different.</p>
<p>“All baseless judgments. If we take a step back and your words turn into reality, what do you think is the right way to respond?”</p>
<p>“Time is running out for us and for Kronos. Marquis Benedict will try to encroach on Cairo’s territory before he falls, and if so, it is clear they will do their best from the start. Even if we move to the third line of defense, there is no guarantee we can stop their attack. In the end, there is just one way.”</p>
<p>Her gaze was focused. If she had noticed Kronos’s intentions and decided it was best for them to retreat, she also needed to pay attention to this choice.</p>
<p>“There is a saying that offense is the best defense. I think it is best if we run into them first and weaken them so they cannot knock us down in the coming five days.”</p>
<p>Attack—at Flora’s remarks, the faces of the leaders were flustered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a different and impossible idea. And because Flora knew why they were flustered, she presented what she had prepared in advance.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Rustle.</em></p>
<p>She unfolded the material. As the people’s eyes focused, she explained in a calm voice,</p>
<p>“We need to analyze Kronos’s attack pattern. When they invaded simply as a warning, they normally attempted hand-to-hand combat, but when they needed a certain victory like now, they liked to mobilize their war magicians. The data presented here proves it. It is Kronos’s general pattern to use magic to demolish the walls and invade the castle with their troops.”</p>
<p>“That is something we know. Isn’t it more important to secure the mana stones along with war supplies?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If we use Magic Defense, the fight will last for a long time. But it is an open fact on both sides that if the enemy uses their war magicians, we will use Magic Defense. And the war magicians will amplify their power. And if it is the Kronos Empire, which has seven Magic Towers, bringing in more magicians isn’t a difficult task to do.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The page was turned.</p>
<p>“Look at this. The enemy’s attacks have a certain pattern. Their magicians maximize their power while using magic from a safe distance from our arrows. This is because mages are vulnerable when casting magic, and the distance is usually around 1 km. Not only do the arrows not reach the distance, but even if we attempt a long-range attack, the accuracy is very low. And if they have more magicians, they will be ready with defensive spells.”</p>
<p>“It’s about 1 km. Does that mean there’s a way we can use that?”</p>
<p>“Yes. If we can anticipate where the magicians will be and set a magic trap in that area.”</p>
<p>Baron Noel smiled as if he were exhausted. Flora’s words were nice to listen to, but they were also absurd.</p>
<p>“It is impossible. Although the 1 km distance can be specified, it only refers to the distance from the castle wall, and it isn’t possible to guarantee where they will cast their magic. We also can’t secure magic traps in huge quantities, and the magicians can detect the location of the traps with mana. If they feel anything strange, they will make the traps useless and use magic from a safe location.”</p>
<p>“Right.. so, from now on, we need to act strategically.”</p>
<p>Flora’s voice rose as she looked at everyone. Right after entering the academy, she learned about the bloody battlefields.</p>
<p>“We must offer them a Battle of Great Warriors.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In a war between nations, a Battle of Great Warriors is used to suppress the opponent’s initiative. Since the Kronos Empire is strong, they will not refuse it because they are sure that their men will win.”</p>
<p>“Even if they accept it…. No way?!”</p>
<p>Baron Noel was shocked at her strategy. He figured out what Flora said.</p>
<p>“If we set up in advance and offer them a Battle of Great Warriors, they will have no choice but to move their troops according to our position. Then, it is possible for the magicians to select a place from which they will cast their spells. They will leave the troops behind and move forward to cast their magic, which will greatly reduce the margin of error.”</p>
<p>“Then, how about them feeling the mana?”</p>
<p>“The swordsman who will participate in the Battle of Great Warriors plays a huge role. If the swordsman fights with his aura at its maximum, the mana concentration in the surroundings will increase. Even the most sensitive magician cannot get through such a raging aura and detect the magic traps. The moment they step on the magic traps with complacency because of the battle in front of them, we can destroy them slowly and surely.”</p>
<p>The plans she made surprised all of them.</p>
<p>Baron Noel, who had been looking at her negatively, was now nodding his head. This was the best outcome. He only raised his voice because it seemed impossible, but now he was willing to accept it. Her plan was charming. They could deal with the magicians and delay Kronos.</p>
<p>Flora added,</p>
<p>“The question is, who will be the Great Warrior willing to go? The allied warriors will have to risk their lives and prolong the match for our plan to work. No, to be honest, the one who is willing to go might not even survive. I am not sure what kind of swordsman the Kronos Empire will send out, but the opponent won’t be easy to defeat.”</p>
<p>It was a dilemma. In order to complete the operation, one had to die.</p>
<p>And right then, one of the people in the meeting said,</p>
<p>“I will do it.”</p>
<p>At that moment, everyone was surprised. The man was Rodwell Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 184 - Current Life’s Relationship (2)</p>
<p>All the people who were there looked at each other. Rodwell Dmitry was someone who fit Flora’s conditions perfectly. He had the skills and the courage, and he was confident enough to make the plan happen.</p>
<p>His time in the West had proven his worth. No one would deny that, but the problem was that Dmitry’s name was too valuable to be lost right now.</p>
<p>So Baron Noel said,</p>
<p>“No. Didn’t Flora say it? The one who will participate in the Battle of Great Warriors must be prepared for death. I understand Mr. Rodwell’s will, but we are not sacrificing someone like you here.”</p>
<p>Rodwell’s older brother, Roman Dmitry, had risen to power in Cairo. If the nobles’ rebellion is settled and Kronos gets defeated, then the era of Roman Dmitry would start.</p>
<p>Baron Noel wasn’t stupid. He was patriotic and experienced all sorts of hardships on the Western Front, but he also had the desire to return to the capital with great achievements, so he couldn’t send out Rodwell now. Roman Dmitry’s existence, the backbone of the Dmitry family, made the value of this man different.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“So is there another swordsman who can participate on my behalf then?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that something we have to look into? Rather than making a quick decision…”</p>
<p>“No. When a choice is made because of the decision of the leaders, we have no choice but to force the sacrifice on those who obviously do not want it. It’s for Cairo, so how can a knight refuse this act? And with this plan, there aren’t that many options. There are swordsmen stronger than me on the Western Front, but their lives cannot be sacrificed in such a place. You have to think about the situation after the Battle of Great Warriors is over. So it is only right to make the most meaningful choice now.”</p>
<p>He was not the best swordsman in the West. Currently, even Count Vandenberg was a 4-star swordsman, but he couldn’t let the commander die.</p>
<p>Rodwell looked at everyone. They were all shocked, but no one could say that he was wrong.</p>
<p>“Someone has to do this. But this doesn’t mean that I am going with the intention of putting my life on the line. I will do my best to defeat the warrior that the Kronos Empire sends, so allow me to go there.”</p>
<p>“….Rodwell.”</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg called out to him, looking sad. Rodwell Dmitry, who was assigned to the Western Front as his first assignment, was an immature kid like any other his age. He had seen so many deaths, and he finally grew up. He is now a full-fledged swordsman, and he has earned the respect of everyone.</p>
<p>The meeting room was silent. Even though he was his disciple, Count Vandenberg couldn’t be considerate of only one person. And so…</p>
<p>“I understand. Rodwell Dmitry, you will take on the role of participating in the Battle of Great Warriors.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>The decision was made. The plan was in motion, and Rodwell Dmitry nodded with a calm expression.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>After the meeting, there was someone waiting for Rodwell Dmitry to come out.</p>
<p>“Why are you so eager to do something risky each time?”</p>
<p>The Western Front had two famous people. One was Flora Lawrence, and the other was Rodwell Dmitry. They both went to the Cairo Royal Academy.</p>
<p>Rodwell was granted one year of service for training, but he chose to stay on the Western Front to complete his full term. It was during the time when Dmitry was in the spotlight. And no one understood why he chose to abandon his wealth and honor only to stay back in this dangerous place.</p>
<p>In each battle he participated in, he always took the lead. He never backed down even a little against the Kronos Empire and led the Cairo army in front.</p>
<p>And now the people on the Western Front truly respected him. He was considered a strong warrior, but not by Flora.</p>
<p>“You are not a normal person. People say that it is an act of patriotism for Cairo, but the truth is that you are a madman who can’t die. There are a lot of people here who follow you. The leaders here have acknowledged the fact that you are the best, but if you really want to do something, then you shouldn’t die like this.”</p>
<p>“This is something I need to do.”</p>
<p>Rodwell looked at Flora. Flora Lawrence—he had heard of the rumors about her. She was the woman who promised to marry his older brother but broke off their engagement and gave up her noble life. Perhaps she was someone who could understand his feelings.</p>
<p>“Flora. You know what kind of person Roman Dmitry was. That was why a wise woman like you made the extreme decision of breaking off that marriage. How did you feel then? Were you willing to accept the fact that Dmitry’s trash is different from the rumors? I do not. During my time in the West, so many things changed in Dmitry.”</p>
<p>In the last few years, Roman Dmitry’s transformation had been shocking. He denied the truth at first, but the rumors forced him to accept it. And everyone told him how they wished to have an older brother like him. However, Rodwell Dmitry, who remembered his time with his brother, fell into a sense of alienation.</p>
<p>“In my life, Roman Dmitry was nothing more than an idiot. Yet he is now called the Hero of Cairo. People applaud Dmitry for his bright future, but I will never entrust my future to someone whom I hate calling my brother. So I extended my period here, and I will do anything to surpass him here.”</p>
<p>He denied the reality and covered his ears. He risked his life on the battlefield and made every effort to get stronger.</p>
<p>And it will be the same now. It was a life-threatening decision to move forward, but he hoped that this would make him stronger.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry defeated Richard Nicholas. Hearing the rumors that he stood tall as the greatest in Cairo burned Rodwell’s heart.</p>
<p>Flora was speechless. She was feeling complicated. At one point, she was also confused by Roman’s personality, so she couldn’t conclude what the other person’s feelings were.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry asked,</p>
<p>“Then why are you here?”</p>
<p>Flora bit her lip.</p>
<p>What should she say? Thinking of an excuse to give, she realized she didn’t want to lie to Rodwell Dmitry. She and he were both swept up in the same fate. If Roman Dmitry hadn’t changed, the two of them would have never met on the Western Front.</p>
<p>“There was a time when I almost killed a lot of people because of my immature thoughts. And so, I decided that I needed real experience to not let that happen again. So when you asked me, I wasn’t sure. I will not ask you why. But…”</p>
<p>She looked into Rodwell’s eyes. His eyes didn’t look like the eyes of someone who had given up on life.</p>
<p>“You need to win. I hope you survive and live a meaningful life.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day of the showdown arrived. Far away, the Kronos Empire’s army was visible. Rodwell Dmitry went out of the fortress alone and looked at the enemies.</p>
<p>‘I might die today.’</p>
<p>He made his decision, and many people came. Those who dissuaded him, saying he was being reckless, sighed as they looked at Rodwell, who didn’t waver.</p>
<p>After hearing the rumors about Roman Dmitry, Rodwell, the wise man people knew, began to act like he had multiple lives.</p>
<p>He knew it too. It was dangerous this time, but if he didn’t do this, he would never become stronger.</p>
<p>‘With experience that conforms to common sense, there is no choice but to grow. Roman Dmitry is the greatest sword in Cairo. The world calls him the best in Cairo, but I don’t want to be inferior to him.’</p>
<p>People could call it an inferiority complex. But for whatever reason, Rodwell Dmitry stood there. Breathing deeply, he raised his sword that he had sharpened all night.</p>
<p><em>Chak! Chak!</em></p>
<p>Not far away, the troops of the Kronos Empire lined up, and Rodwell Dmitry stood tall. With all their focus on him, he used mana in his voice.</p>
<p>“I am Rodwell Dmitry of the Cairo Kingdom. I, Rodwell Dmitry, will request the Kronos Empire to a Battle of Great Warriors!”</p>
<p>From now on, he took a step into the crossroads of life and death.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was as Flora had expected. The Kronos Empire had no reason to refuse. They arrogantly sent an unknown swordsman.</p>
<p>“I am Osford. I will duel against you.”</p>
<p>Osford was someone who couldn’t even reach the bottom of the empire’s rankings. Yet no one from Cairo smiled at this. Unlike in Cairo, where you could pass the rankings even if you only reached the 3-star level, in Kronos, one had to be around 4-stars. It was a different world from Cairo.</p>
<p>They sent Osford as a mockery, not thinking that he was weaker than Rodwell. Besides, Rodwell wasn’t even a ranker in Cairo. Since the apparent difference in their skills was absolute, Osford was also confident.</p>
<p>And the battle started like that. As expected, Osford took the lead.</p>
<p>“How dare you?!”</p>
<p><em>“Kang!”</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>It was overwhelming. As soon as the start of the battle was announced, Osford rushed ahead, and his sword with aura didn’t allow Rodwell to catch his breath.</p>
<p>Osford was a 3-star swordsman. The Kronos Empire obtained data about the swordsmen in the western part of Cairo and found out that Rodwell was a 2-star swordsman.</p>
<p>Reaching the 2-star level in his early 20s was an impressive achievement. However, that was only a high evaluation for the future, and it wasn’t enough to threaten the Kronos Empire now. So they deliberately sent out Osford.</p>
<p>They wanted to show that Rodwell Dmitry could be overwhelmingly defeated by an unknown swordsman who was not a ranker.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuek!”</em></p>
<p>He was pushed back. Rodwell Dmitry blocked the attack with his quick reaction speed, but he couldn’t help but be pushed back by a couple of collisions. From the start, the difference between the two was obvious.</p>
<p>Osford slammed forward once again, prompting Rodwell Dmitry to defend, and as soon as his opponent blocked his attack, he kicked his stomach.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>A strong shock happened. Suppressing what was rising inside him, Rodwell Dmitry quickly tried to counterattack. But…</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p>His own forearm was cut, and blood splattered. No matter what he did, Osford responded, and with time, the wounds on his body increased. As a swordsman whose skills were recognized in Cairo, he was blocked by the empire’s walls.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry clearly had a promising future, but he had never held his breath against an unknown swordsman.</p>
<p>A weak nation—that was the reality of Cairo. The reason they couldn’t even open their mouths against the empire was that there was an overwhelming difference in power.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p>His armor was distorted from the punch. He felt dizzy. Rodwell had this urge to just collapse, but he clenched his teeth and held on until the end.</p>
<p>‘This is the expected result.’</p>
<p>The people expected a miracle. Could Rodwell win? No, it was impossible. No matter who they sent, the Kronos Empire would send someone stronger. That was what it meant to go against an empire.</p>
<p>It didn’t take long for them to gather their troops, but they ruthlessly trampled on Cairo’s estate.</p>
<p>‘How the hell did Roman Dmitry defeat these beings? I cannot even handle a 3-star swordsman, but he became the sword of Cairo and defeated Butler. Obviously, the Roman Dmitry I remember isn’t that strong. But while I left for the battlefield and tried to become stronger, he reached a level that I can’t dare surpass, to the point where all my efforts seem worthless.’</p>
<p>Hearing the rumors, people praised Rodwell Dmitry. The higher Dmitry’s status was, the more he was treated well wherever he went. But he wasn’t happy. He couldn’t take Roman Dmitry’s fame seriously because he never trusted him.</p>
<p>‘This morning. I heard a report that Roman Dmitry subdued the rebels. He made the impossible possible again and proved his worth. I can no longer deny that Roman Dmitry is now an untouchable being. I’ve heard the rumors about his fame, and it proves Roman Dmitry’s worth.’</p>
<p>He also knew it—he could no longer close the gap between himself and his older brother. But even though he knew that, he still stood on the battlefield because he couldn’t accept it in his heart.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>His face was cut. There was a long cut on his cheek, but Rodwell Dmitry’s eyes didn’t waver. Looking at Osford, he rushed forward.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>“How dare this bastard?!”</p>
<p>He knew he couldn’t win this duel in the usual way, so he came up with a plan. It was the same pattern. He made a counterattack, aiming it at the opponent’s lower body.</p>
<p>After pushing him to defend with repeated attacks, he aimed at the opponent’s vital points in a different pattern than before. He gave up on his body and the pain. His entire body was stained in blood, and he couldn’t withstand it any longer.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. The attack was swift.</p>
<p>Because of his experience on the battlefield, Rodwell’s movements were bold. His attack, which moved like flowing water, pierced a gap, but Osford managed to respond well.</p>
<p>“You cheeky bastard!”</p>
<p>His sword flashed, but even so, Rodwell didn’t stop. As he continued to receive his opponent’s attacks, he accumulated data in his mind on how he had been moving until now.</p>
<p>‘At this rate, I might lose concentration.’</p>
<p>The opponent was sure that he would back down, but Rodwell clenched his teeth.</p>
<p><em>Pat.</em></p>
<p>One side of his vision was already dark. At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>Rodwell’s sword pierced his opponent’s vital points. Osford was shocked, but by the time he was about to counter, Rodwell Dmitry had already decapitated him.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Blood gushed from his cut neck.</p>
<p>During his time on the Western Front, he learned that the difference in aura doesn’t guarantee victory on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Blood flowed from his eyes. One eye was stained with terrible pain, but Rodwell Dmitry smiled, raising his middle finger at the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>“Get lost, bastard.”</p>
<p>On the second day of the three days that Roman promised, the Cairo Kingdom succeeded in overpowering the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 185 - Current Life’s Relationship (3)</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry didn’t have a very happy childhood. Although born into a noble family, his only older brother kept walking on the wrong path.</p>
<p>“I really don’t understand. How can he and Rodwell be brothers?”</p>
<p>“Maybe they are half-brothers?”</p>
<p>“What is certain is that Rodwell is in a bad situation. He has to live with that horrible Roman Dmitry for the rest of his life. If I was in Rodwell’s shoes, I would have demanded my father to drive out Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>On that day, Roman Dmitry found a slum. He went to meet his friends from the time their family was still commoners and after playing all day long, he smelled and looked filthy when he returned home.</p>
<p>It was a scene that Rodwell and the other noble kids witnessed, and the words they whispered to Rodwell stuck to him. At that time, Rodwell was still a child.</p>
<p>He had lived all his life as a noble so he could not understand Roman, who undermined their family’s status.</p>
<p>‘Why is he living like that? I know that we were commoners once, but we are nobles now. It wouldn’t be too much if he tried to live with a little bit of dignity, but Roman still chooses to do things that ridicule our family. I cannot accept such a person as my older brother.’</p>
<p>He was angry. No matter what achievements he attained, the label of having commoner origins was always attached to them. It was all because of the rumors about Roman Dmitry, and Rodwell couldn’t stand it.</p>
<p>From then on, he desired to be the successor. Rumors said that if Roman inherited the Lord’s position, the Dmitry family would be ruined. So Rodwell swung his sword all night long, and he worked in the forge all morning.</p>
<p>Every time he hit the steel, anger rose inside of him. Rodwell understood Roman Dmitry. He was once a commoner, so he couldn’t abandon the life he once had. But on the other hand, what about his younger siblings? His younger siblings, who were born as nobles, were being dragged into his selfish recollections of his commoner days. It was a world they never experienced but made people point at them.</p>
<p>Rodwell knew what it felt like, so he wanted to make sure his younger brother didn’t feel the same humiliation. He had to be the brother their youngest was proud of. So he worked hard to become an aura swordsman and entered the Royal Academy.</p>
<p>He had a life that people looked up to. Everything was perfect, at least until the rumors spread that Roman Dmitry had defeated Homer.</p>
<p><em>Kiiik.</em></p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>The gates opened and Rodwell Dmitry stepped inside. Blood was flowing down from his left eye, which had deep sword wounds, and every part of his body had injuries. Just the fact that he could walk was already amazing.</p>
<p>As the cheers of the soldiers on the fortress walls sounded muffled, Rodwell suppressed his memories. He still couldn’t accept his brother’s existence. It seemed that unless he saw Roman Dmitry in person, he would never be able to shake off the emotions from his childhood.</p>
<p>And at that moment, there were people who went out to meet him. They were Count Vandenberg, the leaders, and Flora.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry walked up to Flora.</p>
<p>“My role is done. Will the plan succeed?”</p>
<p>He asked a humble question, not losing eye contact.</p>
<p>Seeing him straight in the eye, Flora nodded.</p>
<p>“Yes, definitely.”</p>
<p>A confident voice.</p>
<p>From now on, it was time for them to lure their enemies into the trap.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Even after their defeat in the Battle of Great Warriors, Kronos didn’t waver at all. From the moment they sent Osford, it was just simple entertainment for them. Their victory was a natural result, and even if one of them was defeated, they didn’t doubt their win.</p>
<p>Rather, anger rose. Count Fabio, the commander of Kronos, marched forward.</p>
<p>“Prepare the Flares!”</p>
<p>“Starting now, the Flares and the magicians will attack and break down the enemy’s walls.”</p>
<p>It was as they had expected. The war magicians came out, and from the top of the fortress’s wall, Flora watched them.</p>
<p>‘If the magician is more than 300 meters away from the magic traps, they cannot be killed right away. The farther the explosion range is, the weaker the power of the traps is, and it is certain that they will use shields to protect themselves right after they explode. As planned, the margin of error is around 100 meters. If the magicians on top of the traps are defenseless when they cast their magic, we can wipe out their existence with a single blow.’</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The magicians moved, and their location was not as they had planned. It was possible to identify the location of their enemies during the Battle of Great Warriors, but the miracle of them standing on top of the magic traps didn’t happen. Their location was about 150 meters away from the magic traps. It wasn’t the ideal situation, but that didn’t change Flora’s plans.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg asked,</p>
<p>“Flora. When will you explode the magic traps?”</p>
<p>“They’ll have enough time to prepare if the explosion happens too soon. Magicians become vulnerable at the moment they cast their magic. If we aim for that perfect timing to set off the magic traps, the backflow of mana will render those war magicians immobile.”</p>
<p>“I get it. Just give me the signal.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Their nerves were on edge. First, Cairo’s soldiers moved. By directing them to attack from a distance, it showed that the Cairo Kingdom would respond normally.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The arrows that were shot through the sky didn’t reach the magicians. Most of them couldn’t even get close and fell, and the arrows that landed near the magicians lost their power.</p>
<p>At that moment, an aura of mana rose around the magicians. Until their magic reached its peak, the war magicians didn’t notice the existence of the magic traps.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Their manas shone brightly, and at that moment, Flora shouted,</p>
<p>“Now!”</p>
<p>“Explode it!”</p>
<p>The magic traps were triggered. Just before the magic of the magicians manifested, there was a huge explosion.</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t something anyone could react to. Flora had installed layers of magic traps in specific locations, and the series of explosions completely wiped out everything.</p>
<p>The magic of the war magicians was canceled in that shock, and they all coughed up blood. Before long, many died from the explosion.</p>
<p>Flora’s plan was a success. It was a plan that began with the Battle of Great Warriors, and now they have succeeded in removing the powerful weapon of the Kronos Empire. But…</p>
<p>“It is fine. This only makes me angrier. The Cairo Kingdom is currently in a civil war. How dare those bugs think they can stand up to the Kronos Empire?!”</p>
<p>“Woaahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>The command was given. They were only able to remove one weapon called the war magicians. At the sight of the enemies flocking towards them, dark clouds rolled over the Western Front.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a blood-curdling sight. Not long after, the army of the empire stormed into the walls, straddled a dozen ladders, and quickly climbed up the walls.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>“Push the ladders!”</p>
<p>Cairo’s soldiers were desperate. They were pushing down the ladders that were being set up on the walls, and some soldiers threw hot water and arrows at the enemies. It was clear that they had the advantage. They managed to reduce a significant number of enemy troops with this method, but this didn’t guarantee their victory.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the empire didn’t stop. They continuously climbed the ladders, and soon they were able to set foot on the walls.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>An arrow pierced the enemies. It was Flora. Equipped with clothes for war, she aimed her arrow and climbed up the wall to deal with enemies one by one.</p>
<p>“Do not lose focus! The enemies have lost their war magicians! The fight is in our favor!”</p>
<p>She screamed loudly. Blood and death—screams could be heard from everywhere. There was no way to know whose side was screaming, but Flora wasn’t shaken.</p>
<p>Right after she arrived in the capital, Flora had two teachers. One was a professor teaching tactics at the Royal Academy, and the other was a commander who was called ‘Sharpshooter’ in the neighborhood.</p>
<p>She experienced war in Lawrence. Her plan, which she thought would work, collapsed with a single Flare, and looking back now, her decision almost cost them their lives.</p>
<p>Why? Couldn’t she have thought of the Flare? No matter how financially overwhelming their opponent was, she should have considered the existence of the Flare.</p>
<p>So she studied tactics in order to make the right decision in similar situations, and she learned archery because she knew that war is ruled by logic. No matter how plausible her tactics were, she needed the power to kill the enemy.</p>
<p>Flora didn’t want to be a commander. She wanted to become a being who could defeat the enemy by joining forces with the soldiers.</p>
<p>Her pretty hands became ugly. Even though her fingers now had scars and calluses, she wasn’t ashamed of her hands because these hands would bring her results.</p>
<p>The arrow that left her hand pierced the enemy’s head.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“Do not pull back! The moment the Western Front collapses, our families in Cairo will be in danger.”</p>
<p>The battle was fierce. The Kronos Empire, which appeared to be on the verge of capturing the castle at any moment, was being pushed back as time went on.</p>
<p>Once again, it was a strategic success. Count Vandenberg gave up the second line of defense and concentrated the troops here, and thanks to that, they weren’t shaken by the empire’s attacks.</p>
<p>And finally, the Kronos Empire retreated. They didn’t win the war. Their first attack was blocked, but the war had just begun.</p>
<p>On the next day, the attacks resumed. They pushed their troops to the wall, almost fell, and then ordered a retreat once again.</p>
<p>It was their last breath at the edge of a cliff. The original plan was to last five days. However, since they had to deal with the war magicians, the Western Front faced a crisis.</p>
<p>But the Kronos Empire didn’t attempt a third attack. The reason was clear—Roman Dmitry’s army of the kingdom arrived on the Western Front.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Just three days. The miracle turned into reality. During the time when they thought that he was still putting an end to the rebellion, Roman Dmitry appeared on the Western Front.</p>
<p>The leaders gathered. Count Vandenberg couldn’t hide his admiration for Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… you are amazing. In just one day, you were able to clean up the rebellion of Marquis Benedict. Thanks to you, we are able to take a breather. If you had arrived later, the fate of the Western Front wouldn’t have been guaranteed.”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed. The Western Front did its best. Obviously, it resulted in a perfect situation, but the problem was that the power of the Kronos Empire was too great.</p>
<p>In the meeting room, Roman saw familiar faces—Flora with her haggard hair and Rodwell with bandages around his eyes. From the moment they saw Roman Dmitry, they both seemed agitated. Every time their eyes met, their eyes would widen, but Roman Dmitry never spoke to them, and then they would avert their gazes.</p>
<p>Looking at Count Vandenberg, Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Please assemble the troops now.”</p>
<p>“… can I please know the reason? Kronos might not attack. Marquis Benedict’s nobles’ faction, which was communicating with them, failed, and their siege in the third line of defense also failed. From what we expect, within a day or two, the enemies will likely clear this place.”</p>
<p>The war was over. It was Cairo’s victory—no, it couldn’t be called a victory. The Kronos Empire judged that there was no benefit and chose to withdraw. But Roman had other thoughts.</p>
<p>“The enemies invaded Cairo’s land. Up until now, Kronos has become accustomed to trampling on us and leaving whenever they please, but from now on, Cairo will take a hard stand against the enemy’s actions. His Majesty has entrusted me with full authority over the situation. So prepare the troops and open the gates.”</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg was shocked. He knew what Roman’s words meant.</p>
<p>“We will pursue the enemies who are returning to the empire and defeat them.”</p>
<p>It was a statement that was different from what they expected. Everyone was shocked.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 186 - Counter Attack (1)</p>
<p>Everyone doubted their ears. In a situation where the war was over, the option of opening the gates and attacking the enemy was never considered.</p>
<p>And Baron Noel said,</p>
<p>“… that is impossible. Even though we used our geographical advantage to defeat the opponents, the difference in our powers is too much. The moment we leave the city gates, Cairo will be the one suffering. And even if we can take down the Kronos Empire, will that benefit Cairo? Even if it doesn’t, the atmosphere in the kingdom is still chaotic due to the civil war, so I think now is the time for us to strengthen our internal power.”</p>
<p>The captains of the west recognized Roman Dmitry’s abilities. Seeing how he had arrived in the West in just three days, which they thought was impossible, they seemed to understand why Roman was called the Hero of Cairo.</p>
<p>He was the type of person who couldn’t be judged by normal standards. They were happy to have him, but they couldn’t agree with his plan. Even Flora Lawrence, who previously didn’t support Baron Noel, sided with him.</p>
<p>“The soldiers on the Western Front have endured a hard time in the past few days. They are  tired from watching the enemies all night, and opening the gate now is like suicide.”</p>
<p>She looked at Roman—the man who made a huge difference in her life.</p>
<p>He was never the type to speak of lies, so she clearly emphasized how dangerous this was.</p>
<p>“The Western Front is a strategic point. Our priority isn’t to kill as many forces of the Kronos Empire as possible but to protect Cairo’s safety. Roman Dmitry. Your proposal will not be accepted. If all the nobles of Marquis Benedict, who were siding with Kronos, had been handled, then the Kronos Empire would have had no reason to stay. It will be a huge risk for us to walk out and fight with someone as powerful as them.”</p>
<p>It was a valid argument. The war was over. As always, it was time to focus on cleaning up the aftermath of the war. But…</p>
<p>“Do you really think that is the best choice?”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He wasn’t going to accept the general opinion.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The captains of the West—their words and their reactions were the same as the King’s. On the way to the Western Front, he had spoken to the King, who reacted with concern.</p>
<p>[… you want to attack the Kronos Empire as soon as you arrive on the Western Front?]</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>[That is a reckless move. Even if the Kronos Empire attacked us, we do not have the power to do the same. Defeating enemies in a war is a different matter. If we attack the Kronos Empire first, which is aiming for our land, they will use this as a dispute between the nations and invade us again. And the truth will never work for us. Regardless of who made the first mistake, Cairo’s safety cannot be guaranteed.]</p>
<p>It was the reality of the weak. Even if their actions were the same, the results were different depending on the logic of power. The Kronos Empire has always invaded Cairo’s borders despite being criticized by international forces, and Cairo would never be able to respond to them.</p>
<p>It wasn’t that they didn’t have the desire to take revenge. Anger rose whenever their people died, but Cairo’s survival was more important, so they chose to stay silent.</p>
<p>Roman understood it. The reality of a small nation was hard to accept, but the situation is different now.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty. The Cairo Kingdom experienced the pain of having its flesh cut due to this civil war. The army of the kingdom had a cause and punished the rebels, but the killings that occurred in the process were cruel in the eyes of the people. We have a lot of work to do in the future to become united. Once the remnants of the nobles have been cleaned up, we will have to decide what to do with the empire’s spies. At that time, what justification will the King present to the people? Will you be able to pull out your sword to deal with the Kronos Empire, which directly attacked the borders? Or will you just stand by? A slaughter that has lost its justification cannot garner the support of the people.”</p>
<p>It was an obscure problem. The Kronos Empire openly joined the rebellion. They invaded the borders because of Marquis Benedict, but the Cairo Kingdom didn’t even touch them.</p>
<p>Then, what did the empire’s spies do? Marquis Benedict declared rebellion, so there was a justification for going against their faction, but would it make sense to subdue the rebels without touching the empire that sided with them?</p>
<p>If the civil war was prolonged, then people’s dissatisfaction would grow. And the royal family, which has remained silent to the empire, led a massacre.</p>
<p>“Cairo is at a crossroads. By clearing the nobles, we have unified the power system within the nation, and in the future, we will not repeat the same mistake on the Southern Front. Now is the chance to gain the trust of the people. Attack the Kronos Empire. Show them how wrong they were to use the civil war to invade our borders and that Cairo can wreak havoc too. Even if our action is a problem to the international community, there aren’t that many chances to secure such a situation.”</p>
<p>His voice was strong. Right after the rebellion was sorted out, there was a chance for change. Roman Dmitry knew that the kingdom wouldn’t change in just one step.</p>
<p>From a weak nation, they had to rise into a strong one. And he decided he wouldn’t show mercy to the nobles of the Kronos Empire, unlike before.</p>
<p>“The Cairo Kingdom cannot be swayed by the empire forever. Just one time. If Cairo shows that we have changed by even one percent, then from henceforth, Kronos will be wary about choosing to attack us. We must not fear what this war will bring. If a war will happen anyway, the right time is when the Kronos Empire forms an alliance with the nobles.”</p>
<p>Beyond the screen, the King fell silent. Roman Dmitry was a difficult subject. He constantly put himself at the crossroads of a choice and took on responsibilities that were difficult for him to handle.</p>
<p>A united nation was Daniel Cairo’s dream. Was he drunk on Roman Dmitry? After thinking for a while, he made a decision for Cairo.</p>
<p>[Your words are right. If Cairo moves forward in the right direction, I will have to prove to the people that my decision is right. The Kronos Empire invaded our borders. If we leave them alone, as they openly came to us in the middle of a civil war, the people will think that the civil war is simply a meaningless massacre for the power of the Cairo royal family. Roman Dmitry. I will take full responsibility for this. Go to the West and make them pay the price for invading our borders.]</p>
<p>The weak King showed his will.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry looked at him and did his best as the commander.</p>
<p>“I will execute your orders.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And at the present, the captains of the West looked at Roman Dmitry. When asked if it was the best choice, they weren’t sure.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“Those of you who have been on the Western Front know the truth. Saying that there is no benefit in pursuing the Kronos Empire, saying that going out is dangerous, saying that the soldiers are tired—they all mean nothing. Don’t you all know? Due to the conflict with the Kingdoms’ Alliance, the Kronos Empire’s eyes were on the South, and the enemies were unable to exert their full strength. Furthermore, the recent siege has resulted in the loss of many soldiers on their side, so the Kronos we will face now is weaker.”</p>
<p>Roman picked up on the truth that they chose not to see. For those who didn’t have the courage to open the gates, he showed them the truth.</p>
<p>“The benefit of this decision is that one truth is all we need. And to show that Cairo will not just watch the Kronos Empire commit wrong deeds. If they openly conspire with Marquis Benedict and we are able to take our revenge on them, the people of Cairo will look at us in a different light. They will believe that the Cairo royal family protects them. We must attack our enemies for that.”</p>
<p>Roman’s words agitated everyone. Only then did they discover that Roman Dmitry was different from them. If they were hoping to find stability before their eyes, the Hero of Cairo was fighting for a new future for the kingdom.</p>
<p>Choosing to courageously open the gates wasn’t normal. Since it has never been allowed in history, no one could speak out. Even so, their eyes were burning with desire.</p>
<p>The words spoken by Roman Dmitry set fire to their hearts. How long had they wished for a different future? They had previously been unable to unite due to the power system, but now that it has been demolished, things will be different in the future.</p>
<p>As Roman said, this was a chance. The eyes of the captains focused on one place—Count Vandenberg.</p>
<p>He smiled. The rumors were true. Roman Dmitry was the man who would bring storms and great change to Cairo.</p>
<p>He said,</p>
<p>“So what do I need to do?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The meeting was over. It went as Roman wanted. Hearing that a scouting team would be sent as soon as the sun rose tomorrow, Flora went out and looked at the dark sky.</p>
<p>‘… Roman Dmitry.’</p>
<p>He was a really consistent man. Even in the war with Barco, he chose a method they hadn’t thought of, and this time he showed the same attitude. In the meantime, even though she studied enough books for war, Flora didn’t dare fight back.</p>
<p><em>Thump.</em></p>
<p>Her heart pounded. This wasn’t a rational thrill. As a fellow human being and as someone who studied tactics, she acknowledged how great Roman Dmitry was.</p>
<p>‘I have made a lot of progress all this time. I thought I was a little different from when I was innocent, but Roman Dmitry is at a point where I cannot even look at him. How can I be like this? Whenever I hear anything about Roman Dmitry, I am so shocked by his choices and his ability to execute them.’</p>
<p>She admired Roman Dmitry. If she hadn’t met him, she would have been stuck to the estate like a flower in a greenhouse, but now she was living her own life and creating a life for a person named Flora Lawrence.</p>
<p>Everyone had stopped calling her the Flower of Lawrence. When Flora Lawrence remembered her old self, she was satisfied with this new reality.</p>
<p>She still regretted her past mistakes. But because of that choice, she was now confident, and she had no intention of denying what had happened.</p>
<p>But there was a bit of sadness. She wanted Roman Dmitry, whom she hadn’t seen for a long time, to know that she had changed.</p>
<p>‘Tomorrow, we will face the empire for the first time on the plains. No matter how weakened they are, Kronos is an opponent we can’t take lightly. Things might not work out as we hope, and in the worst case, the third line of defense will fall. I need to calculate the variables that will happen on the battlefield tonight. Just because we will follow Roman Dmitry’s words, it doesn’t mean we should be blinded by them.’</p>
<p>Tonight, she had a lot of things to do. Flora Lawrence was going to war, and she had to be prepared.</p>
<p>Just one mistake. In the past, she might have acted on her emotions, but now she was close to being a perfectionist.</p>
<p>It was then…</p>
<p>“… Uh?”</p>
<p>Far away, she saw two men talking under the night sky. One was Roman Dmitry, and the other was Rodwell Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 187 - Counterattack (2)</p>
<p>During the meeting, if Flora Lawrence had positive emotions then Rodwell had confused ones.</p>
<p>‘…that person is Roman Dmitry?’</p>
<p>The commander of the kingdom’s army. When he appeared, the soldiers of the Western Front opened the road on both sides and let out cheers. Roman Dmitry was a symbol of hope. His arrival on the Western Front in just three days meant that Cairo was no longer in danger of being attacked by the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>Even though they didn’t know much about Roman Dmitry, his actions in the past of defeating the Hector Kingdom, becoming the greatest sword in Cairo, and even taking down Marquis Benedict, caused the people to have complete faith in him.</p>
<p>It was an overwhelming sight. Rodwell Dmitry, who went into battle despite his injured body, looked at the scene with trembling eyes. It made no sense. The existence that was looked up to by the people was different from the Roman Dmitry he knew.</p>
<p>And then the meeting that followed. It was one surprise after another. Seeing him press on the captains and asking them to do their best made him recall his memories.</p>
<p>‘The Roman Dmitry I remember is a drunkard. He lived a life far from the sword and it was common for him to be dragged out of a bar by guards. There isn’t that much of a difference between then and now, so how can a person change so much in such a short amount of time?’</p>
<p>Common sense would say it was impossible. While listening to the rumors, he was always curious as to how the existence in his mind had risen to 5-stars.</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry’s voice and face. He was sure of it. Even though his appearance was a lot better, the marks on his face proved he was indeed Roman.</p>
<p>Actually, he had come to accept this reality to some extent. Even if the rumors were just half true, Roman Dmitry would no longer be called the trash of Dmitry.</p>
<p>And during the entire meeting, he looked at Roman Dmitry. As he listened to everything he was saying, he was getting more confused.</p>
<p>Soon, the meeting ended. Breathing in the night air, Rodwell Dmitri looked up at the sky.</p>
<p>‘… I lived with the single thought of raising my family’s name on the Western Front. But Roman Dmitry made all of my achievements here worthless. Is this the difference in our talent? Everyone called me the future of the Dmitry estate, but I am nothing more than a mess.’</p>
<p>He accepted it. Roman Dmitry, it was clear that his brother was better. Even calling the man who had lived like trash his brother made his stomach churn, so he worked hard, but now it felt like the difference between them was collapsing.</p>
<p>His left eye was sore. As a reward for defeating an existence that was nothing compared to the opponents Roman Dmitry had defeated, Rodwell lost his left eye.</p>
<p>It was a disaster. What had he been striving for?</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p>“Rodwell.”</p>
<p>He heard a familiar voice, and all the hair on his body stood up. When Rodwell Dmitry turned his head, he looked at the older brother in his memory staring at him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A clear face and a manly voice—it was Roman Dmitry. Unlike his face, which reminded him of the past, Roman gave off the atmosphere of not wanting people to touch him.</p>
<p>“I heard your eye isn’t in the best condition.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Rodwell looked shocked. Roman, who had pretended like Rodwell didn’t exist since he had stepped foot on the Western Front, was now asking him this.</p>
<p>“You don’t have to worry about it.”</p>
<p>“With your sacrifice, they were able to deal with the war magicians of the Kronos Empire. You did well. If you hadn’t carried out that plan, the Western Front wouldn’t have held on until I arrived.”</p>
<p>Rodwell kept his mouth shut. It was awkward. This conversation and this situation. Roman Dmitry, who appeared in front of him as his older brother, felt so unfamiliar.</p>
<p>And it was the same with Roman. However, he spoke first.</p>
<p>‘Rodwell Dmitry, my flesh and blood.’</p>
<p>Last year, his father told him the same thing over and over again. Rodwell has been self-assured since he was a child and has always tried to get things done in his own way, but in the end, he was still in his 20s. So he hoped Roman would take care of him.</p>
<p>He knew that the relationship between the brothers wasn’t the best given the issue of succession, but from his father’s point of view, they were both his precious children.</p>
<p>The word ‘blood’ wasn’t a pleasant topic for Roman Dmitry, no, Baek Joong-hyuk. He was forced to compete because he was the son of the Heavenly Demon, and he had to rise to the top.</p>
<p>But this life was different because Roman Dmitry accepted new relationships. Those who remembered the existence of Dmitry’s trash looked at him with prejudiced eyes, but they never rejected his new self.</p>
<p>One by one, he made connections in his current life—Hans, Chris, Kevin, and even Flora Lawrence.</p>
<p>And then he met Rodwell Dmitry. The stories he heard had proven that he hated Roman, but he didn’t care.</p>
<p>‘When I started this new life, Hans gave me blind feelings for just one reason: I am Roman Dmitry. I could have rejected and hated myself like everyone else, but thanks to Hans’s approach, I was able to adapt quickly to this world. The same goes for my relationship with Rodwell Dmitry. There is no reason for me to unconditionally wait for the other person to approach me. I need to renew my relationship with him, just as I have forged new relationships with the ties I had in my present life.’</p>
<p>Dmitry’s second son.</p>
<p>He looked at his younger brother. Whatever he was thinking about him, Roman Dmitry wanted to approach him first. It wasn’t because of their father’s request. There was only one reason: Rodwell was his younger sibling. And for that alone, Rodwell Dmitry deserved to get inside his own walls.</p>
<p>Unlike in his previous life, where he and his siblings had to kill each other, he accepted them as a family in his current life.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“I am not going to be kind anymore, but keep one thing in mind.”</p>
<p>He looked into Rodwell’s eyes. Even though he didn’t show it, Rodwell lost an eye when he was still in his early 20s. And it wasn’t something to be ignored. Even if he was reacting calmly now, the bitterness of losing his eye would sink in.</p>
<p>“You are my younger brother. If you follow me into the battlefield, I will show you what it means to live as a Dmitry. In exchange for Roman Dmitry’s younger brother losing his eye, the Kronos Empire will have to sacrifice countless lives.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Rodwell’s eyes twitched. He didn’t expect any of it—Roman talking to him first and saying those words.</p>
<p>Just as Hans accepted him, Roman was going to embrace Rodwell too.</p>
<p>“So remember. The fact that you and I are brothers.”</p>
<p>A night full of stars. The two brothers reunited like that.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, the Kronos Empire was in a dire situation.</p>
<p>[… Benedict’s rebellion was a complete failure. Now that Roman Dmitry and the kingdom’s troops have arrived on the Western Front, the Kronos Empire has no reason to waste any more time. I think it would be better for us to return.]</p>
<p>It was Baron Charlton, who belonged to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.</p>
<p>He was as annoyed as Count Fabio. He couldn’t let the troops retreat.</p>
<p>“Fucking bugs. We will attack the Western Front, and it should collapse in a day. Baron Charlton. It isn’t that I do not understand the reason for the retreat call, but we have suffered huge damage in the past few days. Does it make sense to run away without doing anything? Just give me a day. Before that, I will make sure to show them what an empire is compared to them.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a matter of winning or losing. Right after the Battle of Great Warriors, and watching the magicians get annihilated by the magic traps, Count Fabio knew they fell into a trap. He couldn’t blame the opponent.</p>
<p>The Cairo Kingdom sent out their warrior, and it was a fair battle. It was because of the empire’s actions that they lost their magicians.</p>
<p>And that was why he hated it. When he thought that his actions were what got them into this mess, he felt horrible. Just once, he wanted to get revenge. Aside from the practical benefits, it was a matter of pride.</p>
<p>[I am aware of Count Fabio’s feelings. However, the opponent is Roman Dmitry and his army. The man is quite an odd character, and if we do anything wrong, we might end up with more damage. Count Fabio, the empire is focusing on the conflict with the Kingdoms’ Alliance. If Count Fabio loses his troops, the aftermath is inevitably going to affect the South. Think carefully, should we continue this war?]</p>
<p>“… Uhm.”</p>
<p>Count Fabio showed an expression that said he wasn’t fine with it. He wasn’t wrong. They fought with the troops on the Western Front in this war.</p>
<p>If they suffered great damage in the war with the Cairo Kingdom, they would have no choice but to bring in troops from other places to handle the situation, and the responsibility of that couldn’t be avoided. Their defeat against the Cairo Kingdom was not enough, and the Kingdoms’ Alliance would not let it pass.</p>
<p>“Damn it. I understand. As soon as the sun rises tomorrow, we will recall the troops.”</p>
<p>Count Fabio accepted it. His stomach churned in rage, but what could he do? There was no other way.</p>
<p>[You made the right decision.]</p>
<p>And that was the end. Count Fabio cut off the communication.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the next day, the Kronos Empire chose to retreat. They organized their camps early in the morning and chose to retreat before the sun rose in the middle of the sky.</p>
<p>“Commander, I will leave the scouts behind, just in case something happens.”</p>
<p>“There is no need for that.”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be dangerous? If the Cairo Kingdom sends us a pursuit team, we might end up having our tails bitten.”</p>
<p>The man’s advice was correct. They needed to leave some scouts behind to see how the enemy was moving instead of just withdrawing.</p>
<p>Normally, Count Fabio would have listened. However, having spent a frustrating time last night, he looked angry.</p>
<p>“Do you think that a nation like Cairo will send someone to pursue the Kronos Empire? The reason the enemies were able to deal with us is because of their wall. If they open their gates and send a team after us like what you said, we can just defeat the Western Front.”</p>
<p>In the wide lands, there was no place to protect themselves. In a situation where they would have to collide head-on, there was no way Kronos would be defeated.</p>
<p>Rather, he wanted them to come out. If Cairo made that mistake, they would pay the price for their complacency.</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant withdrew. He also agreed with his words. Leaving the scouts behind was a precaution, but there was no way that they could threaten Kronos.</p>
<p>Was that why? The reason why the Kronos Empire also decided to call back all of their troops?</p>
<p>Usually, in preparation for enemy attacks, they would move in formation as close to each other as possible, but now they just formed a long procession line. The moment they would get attacked, there was a risk that they would be cut off in the middle. However, despite knowing that, the Kronos Empire made a bold move.</p>
<p>‘Cairo Kingdom. It may seem that the world is yours now as you clean up the rebellion, but it is just a matter of time before you become a vassal state of the empire. Cairo is a starting bridge for us to conquer the continent. The moment Kronos appears on the Western Front again, it will be unstoppable.’</p>
<p>Count Fabio grinned. It was a little comforting to know that their revenge would take place in the future. Trudging along the path, he pictured the future of Cairo in his mind.</p>
<p>How long was it? Just as the sun had risen in the middle of the sky and shone, the lieutenant who withdrew earlier, ran up with a pale face.</p>
<p>“Commander! Enemies have appeared! Enemies are attacking the rear!”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>
<p>At that moment, Count Fabio doubted his ears. Enemies attacked from the rear. Did that mean that they opened their gates?</p>
<p>“Right. The people of Cairo made a stupid mistake.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p><em>Neigh!</em></p>
<p>He pulled the reins of his horse. If the enemies have come out….</p>
<p>“Order the soldiers. Kill every worm of Cairo!”</p>
<p>… Count Fabio judged that this was the golden chance.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 188 - Counterattack (3)</p>
<p>Two hours ago, Roman Dmitry received a report on Kronos’s movement from the scouts. He spread out a map in the conference room.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>“As expected, the Kronos Empire chose to retreat. We sent scouts to check if it was a trap, but they couldn’t find any strange movements of them luring us in. The enemies are currently moving through the plains and through the passages marked here. Because of the overgrown terrain, the enemy needs to prepare for the attack of pursuers but they are maintaining a rather loose formation.”</p>
<p>“They are completely off guard.”</p>
<p>“Yes. The Kronos Empire is clearly aware that they are not safe. So it’s only natural for them to form a tight formation, but they must have completely ruled out that we would pursue them.”</p>
<p>It was an obvious disregard. Outside the walls was a space where there was no need to be afraid of Cairo. Cairo had been invaded several times but regardless of the outcome, Cairo had never sent a pursuit team. And both sides knew it well—the fact that Cairo was just barely enduring its forts to survive, and that they would be unilaterally massacred by the Kronos Empire if they walked out.</p>
<p>So they organized a pursuit team. It was necessary so they could show them that they had changed.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“Our plan is simple. The enemies are keeping a long line as they move, so we plan to divide our forces into two and attack the middle and rear at once. If we cut the middle, the enemies will wander, and we will have a chance to devour the back and the front, and then we can reduce the number of enemies before they can respond.”</p>
<p>“…it’s a good plan, but the problem is when will the troops get isolated.”</p>
<p>It was Baron Noel. Roman’s words were just the possible outcome if things go as planned.</p>
<p>“If the enemy resists, the plan goes wrong. The troops attacking in the middle will become isolated, and that is a chance for them to reverse their attack on us. Wouldn’t it be better to join forces and attack right from the rear? If the enemies unite and respond, it will turn into an all-out war from then on, but a safe hit-and-run strategy can avoid extreme situations. Our goal is easy. Even if we don’t annihilate them, causing enough damage should show them what we mean.”</p>
<p>“No. That will not be enough.”</p>
<p>In this plan, he didn’t want half-baked results. They had to show what would happen to them if they touched Cairo.</p>
<p>“With this attack, we must obtain a record that can be called a great victory. To do so, attacking from both sides is necessary, and it is important to break the ranks of the enemy with a surprise attack. Just like what Baron Noel said, it is true that there are risks involved, but from the moment we open the gates and step out, we have to take some risks.”</p>
<p>And Roman Dmitry firmly added as he looked at the people in the room,</p>
<p>“I will take on the attack in the middle. Undoubtedly, based on the strength that they showed, they can’t withstand our attacks. Their carelessness and the move that we have never made until now will plunge Kronos into the abyss.”</p>
<p>Everyone nodded. If it was Roman Dmitry, the leaders of the Western Front decided to follow him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the sun rose in the middle of the sky, the plan started. Count Vandenberg’s men, who followed through a shortcut, hid in the bushes and waited for the signal.</p>
<p><em>Pung!</em></p>
<p><em>Pung!</em></p>
<p>The flares burst into the sky, and Count Vandenberg drew his sword.</p>
<p>“Everyone attack!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“Wahhhh!”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p><em>Tatatak!</em></p>
<p>It was a surprise attack. Seeing Cairo’s soldiers rush at them, Kronos’s soldiers hurriedly pulled their weapons with shocked faces. However, they had no choice but to be helplessly overpowered by an attack they did not prepare for.</p>
<p>As soon as they collided with Cairo’s men, screams were heard, and Kronos’s soldiers felt like they couldn’t do anything.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>One soldier of the Kronos Empire widened his eyes. As he coughed up blood, he looked at the sword lodged in his stomach.</p>
<p>That was just the start. Cairo’s soldiers quickly dealt with the enemies with their numerical advantage, and it was easy to block and drive their swords into their enemies’ bodies. In an instant, living beings that had just been alive became rags.</p>
<p>Since their swords were unable to pierce their enemies’ chain armor, Cairo’s soldiers held their enemies’ heads and decapitated them. It was the brutality of war.</p>
<p>Every part of the ground was dyed red, and it seemed that Count Vandenberg’s forces had completely taken control of the rear.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“You bastards! Your opponent is Cairo! Do not fall for their tricks!”</p>
<p>A knight of the Kronos Empire shouted. He infused aura on his sword and charged at Cairo.</p>
<p>From that point on, the atmosphere changed. The empire’s army, which was unsure of what was going on and stepping back, was calmly responding against the soldiers of Cairo, who were flooding in like crazy.</p>
<p>Gradually, Kronos had the upper hand. When a similar number of soldiers clashed with them, Cairo was overwhelmed.</p>
<p>Kronos’s and Cairo’s soldiers showed a great difference. If the soldiers of Kronos fought aggressively, the soldiers of the Cairo Kingdom were mere ragtag troops who only knew how to fight within the walls.</p>
<p>They only gained momentum with the surprise attack for a brief moment. When Kronos regained their balance and showed their true form, Cairo was back to feeling weak.</p>
<p>At the same time, Count Vandenberg showed his outstanding strength. He used his 4-star aura and slashed the enemies, but then he noticed that things were taking a strange turn.</p>
<p>‘We will be at a disadvantage at this rate.’</p>
<p>The momentum they held was decreasing. The carelessness of the empire wasn’t arrogance. They were confident in dealing with Cairo no matter what formation they took, and this was proof of that.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg felt impatient. Realistically, it would be right to end it now and retreat with the troops, but the plan was to hold on until the end.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was attacking the middle. He was in a situation more dangerous than him, with two sides of the enemy’s troops possibly attacking him. Yet he had drawn his sword, so Count Vandenberg wasn’t going to step back from this fight.</p>
<p>“Do not back down! Show them the power of Cairo!”</p>
<p>The battlefield was bloody. Count Vandenberg fulfilled his duty as the commander.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Roman Dmitry led the troops to the middle. Unlike the struggling forces in the back, a one-sided massacre happened in the middle.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. Roman Dmitry’s sword continuously splattered blood. He rushed to the front and cut down dozens of people at once, and the soldiers following him showed the same results.</p>
<p>It was not just a simple victory by a surprise attack. After clashing a couple of times, Kronos’s men were shocked.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The soldiers of Dmitry were equally as powerful as the empire’s army. And the enlisted soldiers who followed Roman Dmitry showed outstanding performance among them.</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakang!</em></p>
<p>He was just a normal soldier. An unknown soldier raised the aura on his sword and pushed back a knight from the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>They couldn’t help but be shocked. They were sure that the man was dressed as a soldier, yet he was pushing people back with aura on his sword. It was the power of the Asura technique. Those who followed Roman learned how to use aura one by one, and now even ordinary soldiers have also broken down the wall.</p>
<p><em>Cut.</em></p>
<p>The knight’s head was cut off. An ordinary soldier was able to defeat a knight.</p>
<p>“This is insane!”</p>
<p>“Stop! Stop them!”</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire’s troops were strong, but Dmitry’s soldiers were beyond normal.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. The key figures like Chris and Kevin displayed overwhelming power, and they quickly reduced the number of enemies.</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg’s worries were useless. He thought that Roman would be in danger, but he was the one handling the situation the best.</p>
<p>He had an overwhelming force. He was cutting people down, and he opened up a path.</p>
<p>‘… what is this?’</p>
<p>It was a confusing situation, and one person was more shocked at what he saw.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry, who cut down an enemy, looked shocked. It made no sense at all.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was a saying in Cairo, “Go to the capital if you want to be successful.”</p>
<p>When Rodwell moved to the capital, he came to know why people said it. It was a whole new world. Unlike the rags on the borders, there were guards, a system, and tests for giving them a worthy name. Everyone was right.</p>
<p>Rodwell was called a genius, but to really succeed, he needed to make a name for himself in the capital. And that was his last memory of Dmitry. He was at the level of the capital, yet beings who had not been able to chase after him now showed a shocking sight in front of him.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>It was Dmitry’s soldier. The soldier with a normal face was pushing back the army of the Kronos Empire and drove his sword through their hearts.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the empire were known to be strong. From what Rodwell remembered, it was normal for Dmitry’s level to be unable to stand up to the empire’s troops, but they were now struggling with just one of Dmitry’s soldiers.</p>
<p>The soldier didn’t seem special either. None of them were even wearing any special uniform—just the uniform of Dmitry—yet they were not being pushed back.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. Chris, Rodwell remembered him. Dmitry’s genius turned into a monster in a span of a couple of years.</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Chris splattered blood. The knights of Kronos rushing with their auras were no match for the man, and he kept taking people down.</p>
<p>A gap in his memories rose. The ordinary-looking soldiers and even Chris—they were all different from what Rodwell remembered. Since he was a member of the Dmitry family, he couldn’t understand all of these changes.</p>
<p>And the one who stood out the most was Roman Dmitry. His power wasn’t shocking but astonishing. He proved why he was given the title of the Greatest Sword in Cairo.</p>
<p>“You are my younger brother. If you follow me into the battlefield, I will show you what it means to live as a Dmitry. In exchange for Roman Dmitry’s younger brother losing his eye, the Kronos Empire will have to sacrifice countless lives.”</p>
<p>Roman’s words lingered in his mind. He wasn’t sure what he meant back then, but now he did. The Dmitry family was entirely different. The family, whose name was known only on the borders, was completely changed by Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>He couldn’t understand how it happened. What was certain was that what was in front of him was the truth, and while he was on the Western Front, Dmitry went through many changes. It confused him.</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure how to handle this situation. Rodwell went to the battlefield with one of his eyes covered, but there was no role that needed him there. It was then…</p>
<p>“Chris!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Far away, the troops of the empire were pouring in. Due to the fact that it was a surprise attack, the soldiers who were around the middle flocked.</p>
<p>Roman slashed the enemies as he said,</p>
<p>“From now on, divide the troops into two as planned. You lead the troops and head to the rear. While you help Count Vandenberg there, I will block Kronos’s army from coming this way.”</p>
<p>It was a reckless plan. Rodwell wanted to stop them. But those who gave the orders and those who accepted them fought. They all wanted to take the risk.</p>
<p>“Alright. Group 2, follow me now!”</p>
<p>Chris backed off.</p>
<p>And after that, Roman stayed there, attacking the enemies.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Roman’s aura exploded, and he threw himself at the enemies that were flooding in.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 189 - Counterattack (4)</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>An arrow pierced straight through the forehead of an imperial soldier. Flora Lawrence quickly put another arrow on the bowstring and focused her eyes on the surroundings.</p>
<p>‘We are being pushed back.’</p>
<p>It was as expected. Joining Count Vandenberg’s forces, she did expect that the surprise attack wouldn’t give them too much of an advantage. Anyone with a brain and common sense could guess that.</p>
<p>The soldiers of the Kronos Empire differed in quality right from the start, and that issue was already discussed too. In conclusion, they bet on the odds. Despite knowing they were at a disadvantage, Cairo’s soldiers went ahead with the plan.</p>
<p>“Commander!”</p>
<p>Flora shouted.</p>
<p>She calculated the variables that would happen on the battlefield all night long and presented a plan on how to respond to them. But there was a backlash from the captains. They said it went against the purpose of the plan, but Flora decided that her plan was the perfect way to use the weapon called Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And hearing Flora’s cry, Count Vandenberg raised his voice.</p>
<p>“Put up a Shield Wall right now!”</p>
<p>“Create a Shield Wall!”</p>
<p>The orders were spread quickly, and the soldiers of Cairo, who were scattered in all directions, gathered in one place. Among them, the soldiers with shields stepped forward to form a wall with square shields.</p>
<p>It happened quickly. They didn’t prepare for a long time because they had practiced such things before coming to the battlefield.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>There was a rapidly rising wall of shields. The Kronos Empire had a puzzled expression. The Shield Wall was a strategy commonly used on the battlefield, but it wasn’t a formation suitable for a surprise attack.</p>
<p>Hearing Flora’s operation, Baron Noel said,</p>
<p>“Flora. Speed is important for this mission. The Shield Wall is a way to bridge the gap in our powers, but it will be dangerous for the troops attacking in the middle if we waste time creating a defense formation. We also need to make sacrifices and be aggressive. That way, the surprise attack can at least proceed without any issues.”</p>
<p>It was a valid opinion. Flora didn’t deny it, but one fact separated their opinions—her faith in Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Flora Lawrence was confident that Roman Dmitry would make a difference even if they were attacked on both sides, so it was important for Cairo’s army to preserve their strength as much as possible.</p>
<p>Well, the army of the kingdom couldn’t deal with the empire’s army from the rear alone. Flora’s strong opinion was accepted, and when they were pushed back after the surprise attack, they formed a Shield Wall.</p>
<p>“Put the shield on your bodies!”</p>
<p>“Don’t allow any gaps!”</p>
<p>The battle changed. They went from attacking to defending. The Kronos Empire’s army pushed forward with the idea that they had gained momentum, and Cairo’s soldiers held on tenaciously, blocking the enemy’s attacks with their shields.</p>
<p>But they weren’t just defending. They tried to attack by thrusting their weapons into the small gaps between the shields, and Flora, along with the other archers, would fire arrows.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>Arrows rained down. The empire’s army screamed and collapsed, and Flora shook off the drops of sweat as she pulled another arrow. Her ears were deafened by the screams of people. In the past, she couldn’t look at the blood-stained world, but now she was unshaken by it.</p>
<p>The battle was fierce. Time passed by so slowly. Even after killing and killing and more killing, the number of enemies didn’t decrease, and the gaps in the Shield Wall began to widen. Every time that happened, the soldiers would have to step in to close the gap. Stepping on the corpses of their colleagues, they clenched their teeth to not let Kronos pass.</p>
<p>They felt dizzy. They kept wanting to give up under the hot sun, but they couldn’t lose their concentration in the fight for their lives.</p>
<p>It was when the heat of the battle reached its limit that Flora confirmed something in the distance and shouted with a bright face.</p>
<p>“Allies have arrived! Release the Shield Wall and attack!”</p>
<p>Far away, she noticed the allies running. It was the start of the counterattack that Cairo had been waiting for.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The captain of the troops who arrived was Chris. He appeared with troops and raised the aura on his sword as he rushed toward the enemies.</p>
<p>“Follow me!”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. The soldiers of the Kronos Empire attacked Chris, but the moment they collided, Chris’s sword tore their bodies apart. His simple sword movement gave them chills.</p>
<p>He slashed the first one down and then cut down the heads of the two that came after, and later, when the empire’s soldiers with terrified faces showed hesitation, he hurled himself at them first.</p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>“Stop him!”</p>
<p>It was definite. Dmitry’s soldiers, led by Chris, unilaterally slaughtered the Kronos Empire’s forces.</p>
<p>The battle with Barco, the Southern Front, and the civil war—Dmitry’s soldiers were veterans who had seen a lot of war, which they could not normally experience. They became bloody warriors on the battlefield and did not care if their opponents were as great as mountains, like the empires.</p>
<p>The wars they experienced were weak every time. Overcoming their fear, they went against their opponents, who looked weak and brought victories.</p>
<p>The situation was reversed. Now that they were being attacked from behind, the knight, who was leading the Kronos Empire’s army, raised his voice,</p>
<p>“Hold on a little while. Our allies will arrive. So hold on!”</p>
<p>Contrary to what he said, they were clearly at a disadvantage. And in order to reverse the situation, they had to take down Chris first.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“I will deal with you.”</p>
<p>A 3-star swordsman’s aura exploded. He slashed the soldiers who blocked him and rushed for Chris. He was so focused, despite the chaotic battles happening everywhere. Even though Chris showed a terrifying amount of strength in a short period of time, he still thought that because he was a 3-star swordsman, he would have the upper hand.</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>The knight’s head was blown off. The moment he appeared in front of Chris to swing his sword, he momentarily closed his eyes, and the moment he opened them, his head flew to the sky.</p>
<p>Just with one swing, he was able to take care of a 3-star swordsman. Chris didn’t use aura. He just watched the enemy approach him, and as the enemy attempted to attack, he waited for a gap.</p>
<p>Chris experienced defeating a 3-star swordsman two years ago. His skills and the experience he had gained from the past until now were huge. This was just the start.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire’s aura swordsmen ran at once. Aura raged from all sides, aiming for Chris’s life, but they were knocked out in one hit, just like earlier. In one attack, there was one death.</p>
<p>His swift sword reached its peak. Chris’s ruthlessness terrified the troops of the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>The Swift Sword of Cairo—it was the moment when his existence would make a name for itself on the continent and reveal his worth.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>By the time Count Fabio arrived at the scene, it was horrendous.</p>
<p>“…W-What is this?”</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry. That person blocked their path and butchered their troops.</p>
<p>He felt goosebumps rise. They had the numerical advantage, but Roman Dmitry was able to get the upper hand.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire’s army formed a long procession. As the middle was attacked, all the soldiers who were moving in front flocked to the middle, but Roman Dmitry blocked their path. And that meant that when they arrived there, they would have to face Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>He chose to block the path alone for that reason, despite the fact that it was the worst situation to be in.</p>
<p>‘Does that mean that he can handle all of us?’</p>
<p>No other explanation was needed. The bodies under Roman Dmitry’s feet proved that his choice was correct.</p>
<p>Countless troops were already slaughtered by the time Count Fabio arrived on the scene, and even if they passed him, Dmitry’s soldiers were waiting right behind him.</p>
<p>His eyes were confused by the scene in front of him. He was surprised by Roman Dmitry’s boldness, and he couldn’t understand Dmitry’s power, which was stronger than he thought.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. The rumors were true. At first, he thought Roman Dmitry was just a frog in a well, but he was a monster hiding in plain sight. It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“Commander! The situation in the rear isn’t good! At this rate, the troops near the rear might be attacked and annihilated.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant. After receiving a call from the rear, he spoke in an urgent voice. This wasn’t the time to admire the opponent. Cairo made a bold move to come out of the city gates, and heaven sent them a chance that couldn’t be missed.</p>
<p>‘If something like Cairo can come outside to fight and do this, I will not be able to head back to the empire with a proud face. Taking advantage of Cairo’s civil war had become useless, and if the enemies’ arrogance is not punished, then Kronos will be ridiculed by the continent. I need to let go of the benefits of this battle and punish them.’</p>
<p>“Knights of Kronos.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>They were Count Fabio’s escort. They were the 10th group of the 10 Knight Troops of the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>As they looked at Count Fabio to carry out the order, he spoke in a voice seething with murderous intent.</p>
<p>“Get rid of that Roman Dmitry now. If that guy is taken down, Cairo’s troops would no longer be able to hold on, and then we will move to the rear…”</p>
<p>At that moment, Count Fabio stopped talking. It could have been an illusion, but Roman Dmitry, who was far away from him, was looking his way as if he heard Count Fabio speak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There was a saying that when one comes across a beast, their body hardens. Their roar causes overwhelming fear, and Roman Dmitry’s eyes alone completely distracted him. Seeing those eyes made him go stiff. While he was giving out orders, it suddenly felt like the world had stopped.</p>
<p>And it was then…</p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry cut down a soldier and kicked the ground.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. As soon as he met Count Fabio’s eyes and realized he was the commander, he rushed for him.</p>
<p>It was such a reckless decision. The distance between them wasn’t short, and along the way, there were a lot of Kronos’s soldiers. Common sense made it impossible to think he could pass through them.</p>
<p>And as expected, the empire’s army blocked his path and attacked Roman.</p>
<p>‘He is finished.’</p>
<p>He blinked, and in that fleeting moment, things changed. Roman Dmitry slaughtered the soldiers who rushed at him, and the path was now open. Their distance was shorter than before.</p>
<p>Dozens of soldiers who were willing to die to stop Roman Dmitry rushed to him. And the Knights of Kronos also rushed ahead. Even though Count Fabio wasn’t able to finish giving the order, they knew what he wanted to say.</p>
<p>And among them was a 4-star aura swordsman. His rising aura gave Kronos’s troops confidence.</p>
<p>Blood splattered. The 4-star aura swordsman’s head flew to the sky, and the faces of the other Knights of Kronos had gone pale.</p>
<p>Each time Count Fabio blinked, something shocking happened. He thought Roman Dmitry could never get close to him, but before he knew it, everything changed. Only then did he realize…</p>
<p>‘Insane bastard!’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He was sincerely going to break through the crowds and kill the commander of Kronos.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 190 - Counterattack (5)</p>
<p>100 meters, 90 meters, 80 meters… Roman Dmitry closed the distance. It felt like the nerves on his body were on edge, but Count Fabio didn’t step back. As a member of the empire, he didn’t want to show a scared image to Cairo, and above all, he was sure that he couldn’t die from this.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>It was Gustavo, the leader of the Knights of Kronos. He jumped ahead. Being in charge of the 10th unit of the Knights of Kronos, he felt that he had to handle the situation.</p>
<p>Aura shone on his sword like the sun. Without having to say anything, it proved that he was different from the other Knights of Kronos that Roman had faced until now.</p>
<p>He was fast. As he arrived in front of Roman Dmitry in an instant, he seized the moment that Roman Dmitry was cutting down an enemy and immediately attacked.</p>
<p><em>Kaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>With a single hit, a huge wave of mana could be felt. Gustavo continued to launch a series of attacks without stopping, and the two of them continued to clash.</p>
<p>It was unusual for someone to block Roman Dmitry’s sword. If he hadn’t known Gustavo’s identity, then maybe he would have uttered his surprise, but he already knew of it.</p>
<p>The Continental Ranking’s 78th and the 35th in Kronos’s ranking. He was a talent the world knew. Even though he was ranked higher than Count Nicholas, his existence couldn’t be handled by Cairo.</p>
<p>Gustavo was an example of how powerful the Kronos Empire was. The 5-star aura from his sword was strong. The other swordsmen couldn’t even attack Roman, but this man could handle him. But….</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakakang!</em></p>
<p>Roman blocked all of the opponent’s attacks. At the same time, when the Knights of Kronos attacked an opening, Roman pushed Gustavo away and cut them down at once.</p>
<p><em>Slash!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>That was the scene. And another knight who was waiting to take advantage of the situation rushed in, and Roman Dmitry cut off his chest. But killing just one didn’t bring him any relief.</p>
<p>Immediately, the other knights rushed in, and even while blocking Gustavo’s attack, he killed them all.</p>
<p>Roman was in the middle of the enemy camp. The best swordsman, Gustavo, stepped forward, and yet Kronos couldn’t land a single attack on Roman.</p>
<p>They were all running around insanely. The attacks of the powerful predators were all being stomped down by Roman Dmitry, and it was the Knights of Kronos who were collapsing first.</p>
<p>One, two… more bodies piled up. Roman was at a disadvantage, but with time, Roman Dmitry’s presence overwhelmed the enemies. It made no sense.</p>
<p>Gustavo rushed again. Handling a 5-star aura swordsman was no joke, but the opponent didn’t seem to care. It was like it didn’t even matter. Gustavo focused on one single goal—winning, but at some point, he felt that his opponent was ignoring him.</p>
<p>‘You bastard.’</p>
<p>One against many, and Gustavo was one of the many. There was nothing great about being a 5-star aura swordsman. It was just a slight advantage over the others. At the same time that his anger was rising in such a situation, Gustavo had no choice but to accept one fact.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is a more dangerous person than we think. If that guy is left alive, I don’t know how to face the wars that will come. Even if it means risking my life, I need to deal with that guy here.’</p>
<p>His eyes changed. And…</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>It was the limit. Inside Gustavo, mana began to explode.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>The nature of the attacks changed. It went from having the aura of a warm sun to one that could burn things. His power seemed to have risen twice as much as before.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry raised his mana, mirroring his opponent, and faced Gustavo.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Grrr!</em></p>
<p>A wave of mana rose. The mana immediately made the area so dangerous that normal swordsmen couldn’t get close, and the two of them kept fighting.</p>
<p>Each attack made the ground shake. The clash between the two exceeded human limits, to the point that the soldiers of the Kronos Empire collapsed on the ground due to it.</p>
<p>In this situation, Roman Dmitry felt the change—the change in Gustavo’s attack pattern.</p>
<p>‘The opponent is currently using innate qi.’</p>
<p>Innate qi. It was the qi that the human body was born with. It wasn’t the kind of power that could be generated through cultivation. It was formed naturally as human beings went through life. Aside from having a very small amount of power, innate qi was directly related to life. That just shows how much Gustavo wanted to kill Roman Dmitry, at the cost of his own life.</p>
<p>In the last few years, Roman studied the continent. As far as this world’s knowledge went, there was no way to use innate qi. Maybe it was Kronos’s secret or Gustavo’s. Only he knew the answer.</p>
<p>Gustavo showed his intent to kill Roman Dmitry with an unexpected force, but in reality, it was a force he had already experienced.</p>
<p>In his past life, there were various types of people in Murim. And among them, those who used their innate qi would sacrifice their lives to take down their enemies.</p>
<p>They also knew it. The moment that they would consume their innate qi, the end result would not be good. They might be able to survive, or at the very least live the rest of their lives with a disability, if the battle ended before they used all of their innate qi.</p>
<p>It was a forbidden power. Even the people in Murim didn’t dare touch the power of innate qi.</p>
<p>However, here on the Salamander Continent, he discovered an entity that was willingly touching something that the Murim people didn’t.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The mana was hot. Gustavo ran wild with the power he couldn’t control, but that didn’t change the result. Just like that, there was no change.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry had one year to grow, which, come to think of it, was a year ago. Roman Dmitry had already reached a new level of power and managed to become the head of the northeast.</p>
<p>He had already defeated Count Nicholas, who was stronger than Butler, yet he took his time. Then, was it only his subordinates who got stronger? No—even Roman became stronger. Just as he had reached a level that others couldn’t in one year, Roman had a different growth in the past year.</p>
<p>It was a battle of strength and power. They faced each other head-on. Even though the opponent raised his innate qi, he couldn’t push Roman away.</p>
<p>‘N-No way.’</p>
<p>Gustavo was confused. He had used his innate qi, yet he didn’t want to die or become disabled. It was a secret weapon that was not shown to the world, but he couldn’t accept the fact that he still couldn’t overwhelm the enemy.</p>
<p>The situation was abnormal, and Gustavo had gone beyond his limits. If he still couldn’t defeat the opponent, it meant that Roman Dmitry was not his opponent in the first place.</p>
<p>He had not much time now. His innate qi was decreasing fast, so Gustavo made a decision.</p>
<p>“You will not be able to stop this.”</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>He prepared for his last attack. He raised his mana. Seeing him use all of his aura as if it would be the end, Roman Dmitry also prepared himself.</p>
<p>He didn’t even need to use a mid-level technique. As if the sword technique were fully developed, the power of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art changed.</p>
<p>‘The first three forms of the Heavenly Demon Sword Art.’</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>There was a clash of strength and power. The moment Gustavo’s attack exploded, a storm of aura that shook the world engulfed the two of them.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwa.</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A thick cloud of dust rose. When the energy that swept the world subsided, people witnessed something shocking.</p>
<p>“… Gustavo has been defeated.”</p>
<p>On the ground, they could see traces of what appeared to be Gustavo. His face was so badly torn that it was impossible to identify him, and Roman Dmitry just looked down at the corpse with an indifferent face.</p>
<p>He was as strong as Count Nicholas.</p>
<p>At one time, he thought that the way people in this world used their power was wrong, but now he would admit that their way of handling their power has developed differently from Murim.</p>
<p>But that didn’t mean that he was stronger. The more he accepted the new world, the more he could change from his previous life. Roman Dmitry, as he did in Murim, entered a realm that others couldn’t touch.</p>
<p>Roman shifted his gaze. Count Fabio’s face was pale. He sat on the ground, unable to run.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman walked to him, and there was no one blocking his way. In the situation where even the proud Knights of Kronos were frightened and only looked at them, Count Fabio got up.</p>
<p>“Su-Surrender! I surrender!”</p>
<p>He gave up on his pride. He raised a white flag, but Roman Dmitry’s face didn’t change.</p>
<p>‘He is thinking of killing me.’</p>
<p>He knew it right then. Even if he surrendered, the opponent wasn’t going to spare him. Count Fabio changed his attitude. If the opponent refused to compromise, then there was only one way.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry! I am a noble of the Kronos Empire! Even during the war, Kronos will never forgive any being who touches the nobles. Do you think you can handle it? Come at me! You will have to live in fear of the empire killing you each night. Your blood will dry up, you won’t be able to sleep, and you will lose your sanity. So choose. Save me or take all the honor!”</p>
<p>He screamed loudly. He looked straight at his opponent.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>Roman stopped walking.</p>
<p>“I know the cost of my choices.”</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk was a man who stood at the top. Assassinations were a daily thing for him, and he accepted all of them.</p>
<p>“So die.”</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>He lodged his sword slowly and painfully.</p>
<p>As the soldiers of the empire appeared, Roman Dmitry pushed Count Fabio into the abyss of death.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Grrr!</em></p>
<p><em>Explode.</em></p>
<p>The clash between Roman and Gustavo sent shockwaves everywhere.</p>
<p>“… what is this!?”</p>
<p>Count Vandenberg, who was cutting down the enemies, was shocked at the sudden explosion. The wave of mana he felt was so unusual. Normal soldiers would have been simply startled by the sound of the explosion, but he could feel the mana in the wind.</p>
<p>‘We don’t have much time.’</p>
<p>If anything happened to Roman, the troops in the middle would face a crisis. The reason why Cairo chose to attack from both sides was to stop the enemy from getting help from the troops who were in front, but it was taking longer than expected.</p>
<p>With the help of Chris, he managed to come out victorious in the rear. But he felt something ominous in the aftermath of the explosion.</p>
<p>“Do not worry. What the commander is fearing will not happen.”</p>
<p>It was Chris.</p>
<p>Did he read his thoughts? After calming his anxiety and immediately joining the battle, Count Vandenberg was speechless.</p>
<p>‘How can he be so sure?’</p>
<p>The plan was very dangerous. Roman Dmitry took the most dangerous role, and considering the power of the Kronos Empire, it wouldn’t be a shock if something happened to him.</p>
<p>However, none of Dmitry’s soldiers seemed to be worried. The huge explosion only made them briefly turn their gaze, and soon they went back to battle.</p>
<p>He admired their blind faith. He thought that the driving force behind Dmitry’s revival was the strong ties centered on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Dmitry was a solid iron fortress. After the war was over, the Dmitry family would stand tall as the best family in Cairo. It was then….</p>
<p><em>Pang!</em></p>
<p><em>Papapang!</em></p>
<p>Far away, the signal was fired. Red to attack, yellow to retreat, and green…</p>
<p>‘Means the enemy commander has been killed.’</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes went wide. The flare was green. It was a shocking result that no one had ever thought of, enough to put Count Vandenberg’s worries to shame.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 191 - New Map (1)</p>
<p>At the time of the battle, Cairo’s Royal Palace fell into a deep silence.</p>
<p>‘The fate of Cairo depended on my choice.’</p>
<p>It was Daniel Cairo. Even after giving Roman Dmitry the command to attack, he kept asking himself whether his decision was the right one.</p>
<p>Considering the value of the kingdom, it felt like the right thing to do. However, depending on its success or failure, the price Cairo would have to pay in the future would be either heaven or hell. If successful….</p>
<p>‘A single victory will take Cairo down a completely different path than before. The people will have the pride of not bowing to Kronos and at the same time, the rebels will be organized. Aside from the conflict with Kronos, it is surely our chance to escape from the reality of being a small nation.’</p>
<p>The problem was that if it failed, it wouldn’t just end with the loss of their troops.</p>
<p>‘We mobilized all the troops to the Western Front for this war. The moment they are defeated outside the walls, the Kronos Empire will not miss the opportunity to destroy the West. If the strategically important areas are surrendered to the enemy, Kronos may change its course and directly target Cairo no matter how at odds they will be with the Kingdoms’ Alliance. The battles that have already happened before are enough justifications for war, and even if they intervened in the rebellion, there is no way we can resist them with their power.’</p>
<p>It was the worst possibility. With the kingdom’s power weakened by the civil war, defeat was obvious.</p>
<p>Ah, it was really so difficult. If he knew the answer, or if at least the cost of responsibility would be his own life, he wouldn’t be this worried if it would only end with that.</p>
<p>‘Due to my choice, Cairo has entered an irreversible path. Even if it was the right choice for the sake of the kingdom, history will hold me accountable for the reason for its defeat, and many people will die. We made the perfect reason for the empire to try to take over us and attack us again.’</p>
<p>Everyone’s evaluation was right. He was someone who didn’t fit in this turbulent world. His anxious appearance—trembling alone in an empty palace—was not the type of King the people would want.</p>
<p>He didn’t want to make excuses by saying he was young. Wasn’t Roman Dmitry fighting at the forefront even though he was just in his mid-20s?</p>
<p>He was just lacking. Cairo had a King worthy of a small nation, and even if it was the right decision, he wasn’t convinced that it was the right answer. He was anxious and nervous.</p>
<p>Having the position of King, he had to pay a huge price for each word he uttered. That’s why he tried to believe in people who could compensate for the things he lacked. It was at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Tap. Tap. Tap.</em></p>
<p>From afar, the sound of running footsteps could be heard. Someone was running through the hallway and into the place where Daniel Cairo was.</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>The door opened. The moment he looked at Simon’s face as he entered,</p>
<p>‘Ahh, God.’</p>
<p>With a bright expression as if he had the whole world, Daniel Cairo tightly clenched his fists.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a huge victory. From the other side of the screen, Count Vandenberg said with a face that couldn’t hold back his joy,</p>
<p>[Your Majesty the King! Cairo is victorious! There was a battle in the West and as a result, Count Fabio and the Kronos Empire were killed and the rest of their troops have been captured!]</p>
<p>In the Cairo kingdom, the hastily assembled important people cheered. They were all equally anxious, and the news from the West was like an oasis in a desert.</p>
<p>And Daniel Cairo asked,</p>
<p>“And the damage?”</p>
<p>They’ve passed the dangerous hurdle, however, the problem was not completely solved yet. The process of organizing their internal system remained, and troops were needed to prepare for the Kronos Empire’s response. In addition, the safety of Roman Dmitry was especially important.</p>
<p>[The allies’ damage is not much. It is all thanks to Roman Dmitry’s performance. The surprise attack on the enemies threw them into confusion, and because Roman Dmitry was able to handle Count Fabio, we were able to make them surrender. And in the process, we even dealt with the leader of the Knights of Kronos, Gustavo.]</p>
<p>It was truly an amazing achievement. When Daniel Cairo gave the order to attack, he had his own doubts about the situation. That was how scared he was about Cairo being defeated. Victory was not a result that Cairo was familiar with, and he thought it was fortunate to win against the strong forces of the empire.</p>
<p>However, they were able to become victorious with only minor damage. Daniel Cairo couldn’t hide his joy. He wanted to cheer like everyone else, but he couldn’t let go of his manners.</p>
<p>‘The war isn’t over yet. Diplomacy outside the battlefield is also a war. If I don’t finish the talks with the Kronos empire well, even if we had won the battle, it can lead to bad results..’</p>
<p>“I don’t know how the Kronos Empire will respond to this problem. First of all, the safety of the prisoners will be guaranteed as much as possible, and from now on, we will prepare for negotiations with Kronos. The primary goal is clear. Rather than driving the situation to the extreme and resulting in unnecessary turmoil, we must end this matter as peacefully as possible. The civil war hasn’t been cleared yet. Although the nobles faction led by Marquis Benedict has fallen, we need to bear in mind that their influence is still around, and the nobles of the empires also remain.”</p>
<p>[We will obey your orders.]</p>
<p>The screen was dyed in darkness. Daniel Cairo took a deep breath. He didn’t want to allow any carelessness, but a feeling of relief spread across his face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In the western plains, a warm fire rose in a desolate place.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeik!</em></p>
<p>In the war, as Count Vandenberg said, there was only minor damage. But that was the norm for warfare, and that didn’t mean that only a few people died. Hundreds of people gave up their lives for the operation.</p>
<p>Occasionally, ruthless commanders would refuse to carry out funerals in such situations, but Roman Dmitry held his post and waited until the bodies burned.</p>
<p>He was familiar with death. He had witnessed so many deaths in his previous life, but he tried not to become accustomed to accepting death so easily.</p>
<p>The people risked their lives for him. Even though it was their choice, they knew very well that the moment they accepted their orders, sacrifices would happen, and he knew that if he took them for granted, their trust in him would falter. So Roman was also willing to sacrifice himself for them because he was the one who made them make sacrifices.</p>
<p>Looking at the burning flames, he showed courtesy and bowed.</p>
<p>“Clean up this place.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>The funeral was over. Roman Dmitry, who left Chris to clean up, immediately returned to the fort to assess the condition of those who were injured.</p>
<p>The spacious place was full of wounded. People were groaning in pain, some were looking for a physician to heal them, and countless physicians were looking after the conditions of the other patients.</p>
<p>Before leaving for battle, Roman contacted Count Fabius and ordered the physicians to be sent to the West. Dmitry promised to take care of the expenses, and Count Fabius sent a large number of them. And they all devoted themselves to treating the wounded.</p>
<p>They didn’t just do a simple treatment. They also used expensive potions for those who needed them. And the other soldiers saw it. Knowing that the scene in front of them was because of Roman Dmitry, they were truly amazed.</p>
<p>“Amazing.”</p>
<p>“Using potions to treat normal soldiers.”</p>
<p>“Even though Dmitry has a lot of money, this is all thanks to Mr. Roman.”</p>
<p>Because of the war, the way everyone looked at Roman Dmitry changed. His overwhelming force aroused shock, and they all felt sincerely grateful that he took care of the soldiers.</p>
<p>Actually, even at first, they didn’t understand the blind loyalty his men had toward Dmitry. They thought they were foolish to jump into the fire for Roman Dmitry, but when they witnessed the treatment he gave the soldiers, they came to understand that there was a reason.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t neglect his people. They had never been treated like this before, so they felt a bit satisfied with this.</p>
<p>In addition, they were told that if they died or became disabled in the war, reasonable compensation would be given to their families.</p>
<p>Following Roman Dmitry wasn’t easy. As much as he had a reputation on the continent, they would always be destined to visit a dangerous place, but even so, he was an existence worth pledging loyalty to.</p>
<p>By the time the treatments were over, someone spoke to Roman.</p>
<p>“Can you give me a moment?”</p>
<p>It was one of the Western Front’s leaders, Baron Noel.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He was the brain on the Western Front. Rather than fighting directly on the battlefield, he would make plans or analyze the situation and lead them to an optimal solution. And it was not different this time. He suggested a stable option, although a bit naïve.</p>
<p>While living on the Western Front, he had been through numerous battles, and the pain he had suffered during all those times made him not want to choose Roman Dmitry’s method.</p>
<p>Baron Noel had doubts about the operation until the very end. Considering the difference in power between Kronos and Cairo, a battle outside the castle could not guarantee victory.</p>
<p>But it was a huge victory. Seeing the fort gates open and returning home in gold, Baron Noel finally faced reality.</p>
<p>‘I must have regressed.’</p>
<p>Flora Lawrence. She insisted on trusting Roman Dmitry until the very end.</p>
<p>Aside from the fact that she had already established a relationship in the Northeast with him, she knew how to grasp the flow and accept it. The decision to open the gates, trust Roman Dmitry, and protect the entire force from the rear as much as possible—such an open mind eventually produced the most positive results.</p>
<p>His eyes were open now. It wasn’t the time for him to dwell on getting a position in the capital, but it was necessary for him to develop as someone suitable for the Western Front.</p>
<p>And to make sure of the commitment, Baron Noel approached Roman Dmitry. They went to a place where there were not many people, and he spoke sincere words.</p>
<p>“… I apologize for having a negative view of Roman Dmitry’s judgment. I couldn’t believe it. Born in a nation called Cairo, I wasn’t able to make the decisions that you did, and I felt like a member of a small nation. I thought that I had some experience on the Western Front, but it seems like I was narrow-minded. So I wanted to thank you and also apologize. Thanks to you, the Western Front and the Cairo Kingdom will be safe.”</p>
<p>Baron Noel was a good person. The world he experienced only forced him to make negative choices, but he was fit for the Western Front.</p>
<p>Cairo, a nation known as weak, was supported by figures such as Baron Noel. For whatever reason, they were all at the forefront, shedding blood, and because of their existence, Cairo remained alive despite foreign invasions.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“No. Blind trust on the battlefield is a deadly poison. Instead of blindly following my choices, opposing opinions are also necessary. Only then can we reach a more ideal conclusion. Baron Noel, you did your part well, and we managed to win the war in the end.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for saying that. Anyway, what do you plan on doing next? With Kronos’s prisoners secured, we have the upper hand at the negotiations.”</p>
<p>He changed the topic since there was more work to do. The war would only end once the negotiations with Kronos are concluded successfully, and all the leaders were hopeful about it.</p>
<p>But Roman thought differently.</p>
<p>“The situation isn’t as hopeful as you think.”</p>
<p>“… what do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>Given the past events, Roman Dmitry affirmed Kronos’s choice.</p>
<p>“Even though we have secured numerous prisoners, the empire will not negotiate.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 192 - New Map (2)</p>
<p>Every decision needs a reason. Before arriving at the conclusion that he had to pursue and defeat the Kronos Empire, Roman had to confirm it first.</p>
<p>‘Kronos is a nation that doesn’t stop any time. What kind of choice will they make if they, who had always invaded other borders first, get attacked? If this isn’t clearly confirmed, I might not be able to bear the cost of my decision.’</p>
<p>Based on the history of the continent, there were three examples that could confirm it.</p>
<p>The first was the conflict with the Kingdoms’ Alliance. The Kingdoms’ Alliance referred to the four southern nations around Kronos, and they were not safe from the threat of Kronos just like Cairo. So they formed a coalition to protect each other.</p>
<p>At the times that they were attacked by Kronos, Kronos would demand a formal apology for the reason that the knights of the Kingdoms’ Alliance, who were filled with resentment, brutally slaughtered their soldiers. The conditions were always absurd. They expressed their opinion that they would go to an all-out war if the knights in question didn’t kneel down and apologize.</p>
<p>The other two cases were the same. The Kronos Empire obviously made a mistake first, but in the process of covering up right and wrong, the victims were made to pay.</p>
<p>Similar incidents happened three times in the past. It can be interpreted that the decisions of the Kronos Empire were not accidents, and they had a way to turn things in their favor.</p>
<p>‘The Cairo Kingdom suffered in the same manner. In return, despite their demands for an apology and their repeated aggression every year, nothing was done to punish the enemies. Fighting between nations requires a cause, but having power is more important. The Kronos Empire doesn’t need a sensible reason, and if we take proper revenge, it will cause more problems for us.’</p>
<p>It wasn’t a common thought. Roman Dmitry knew how Kronos would act. It was the logic of the strong. It wasn’t like they didn’t know that they were in the wrong, but what mattered to them was that the weak showed hostility towards them.</p>
<p>Roman also knew that because he had lived the life of a strong man. Ruling through fear was possible if the weak crossed a clear line. Even if the people criticized them, the strong could rule over them.</p>
<p>It was a very slow process. The moment the strong ones controlled the minds of the weak, they could no longer make normal decisions, and no matter what the strong ones did, the weaker ones would just silently endure them.</p>
<p>There was no turning back. Roman Dmitry knew that his decision came with a cost, but he felt compelled to attack.</p>
<p>‘It is something I have to deal with someday. At the crossroads of choice, in order for the Cairo Kingdom to move in the right direction, taking risks is necessary even when the result is obvious.’</p>
<p>Looking at Baron Noel, Roman said,</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire has never made a decision resulting in the detriment of their nation, regardless of whose fault it is. It is the same this time. Even if they joined the rebellion and crossed the border first, what matters to them is the fact that a small kingdom like Cairo opened its gates and slaughtered their soldiers.”</p>
<p>“… then what are we supposed to do?”</p>
<p>Baron Noel was scared. He knew the war had just ended. However, due to an unexpected possibility, he could no longer enjoy the joy of victory.</p>
<p>“It is the same as before. From the moment we first chose to attack them, the one who takes a step back from this fight has no choice but to bear the full damage. Then our choice is simple.”</p>
<p>They had to stand up to the Kronos Empire one day if they didn’t want to be ruled by them, even if it meant their demise.</p>
<p>“From now on, we’ll have to fight another war at the negotiating table.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was as Roman had expected. Around the time the battlefield was almost settled, the Cairo royal family received a call from the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>[As His Majesty’s representative, I will reveal the position of the Kronos Empire.]</p>
<p>The voice was from someone in the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It was Baron Charlton. He had a stiff face as he stared at Daniel Cairo across the screen.</p>
<p>[The Kronos Empire participated in this war at the request of Marquis Benedict. The justification for participating in the war was given by Cairo, and we only agreed with their argument. We do not claim that our actions are right. However, when Marquis Benedict, the subject of the cause, was defeated, the troops of Kronos retreated and showed that we no longer had any plans of continuing the war. But what did Cairo do? It wasn’t enough that you opened your gates and chased after us, but you attacked us and brutally killed Count Fabio and Gustavo, the talents of the empire.]</p>
<p>“We were fighting a war. Is it wrong for us to punish our enemy?”</p>
<p>The opponent was a noble. However, given the fact that he was representing the Emperor, Daniel Cairo couldn’t treat his opponent disrespectfully.</p>
<p>In this negotiation, the leaders of the kingdom put their heads together for a favorable response. They intended on resolving the issue peacefully as much as possible, but the Kronos Empire’s claim shocked Cairo right from the start.</p>
<p>[Yes. It is wrong. Which is why we hope to be given the right compensation for it.]</p>
<p>“That isn’t possible. A war with Kronos was never our intention. We were attacked first, and we just opted to attack back. But you want us to pay you a fair price? If the Kronos Empire decides to act like this, we have no choice but to formally take this case to the ‘International Community.’ And Cairo was even thinking of releasing the prisoners first as a gesture of peace, but if the Kronos Empire continues to be hostile, we are left with no other options.”</p>
<p>He came out strong. Representing the Cairo Kingdom’s voice, he didn’t want to back down this time.</p>
<p>[Do whatever you want. Raising a problem with the International Community will not provide a reason for Cairo to go to war. And Kronos will not accept any bargain for the lives of the captives. Now, we will give you two options. There are no other negotiations.]</p>
<p>It was a one-sided conversation. The other side went silent, and the empire’s thoughts were displayed.</p>
<p>[We request Roman Dmitry’s punishment for brutally murdering Count Fabio. In return, we want one of his arms. If Roman Dmitry comes to the empire, offers his arm, and kneels down to apologize, and if you release all of Kronos’s prisoners, the Kronos Empire will not make this incident an issue anymore. That is your first option. If you reject that, the second option would be an all-out war against Kronos. Negotiations will not be allowed for the first ten days of the war. Make your decision now. If not, Kronos will declare war against the Cairo Kingdom.]</p>
<p>That was the end. Baron Charlton cut off the communication without even listening to his answer.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the Cairo Royal Palace, everyone was shocked after the meeting. They were at a loss for words in response to what they had heard, and they were afraid to figure out how to accept this situation.</p>
<p>They were forced. The Kronos Empire forced them to make a choice even after knowing they were in the wrong.</p>
<p>Simon said,</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, Your Highness. The Kronos Empire is not making this offer to receive an apology right now. Given Roman Dmitry’s ability in the war, it is clear that they intend to eliminate any potential threats against them in advance.”</p>
<p>They were sure of it. Roman Dmitry was an existence beyond the fence of the kingdom. Cairo, which had always been meek and displayed an attitude befitting a small country, took a different step than before with Roman Dmitry in the front.</p>
<p>Other than killing Gustavo, if the testimony from the battlefield reached the Kronos Empire, they would have been wary of the force Roman Dmitry had.</p>
<p>He was just in his mid-20s, yet Roman Dmitry was able to kill Gustavo. He didn’t just win. It was an overwhelming victory, and no one can really fathom how powerful Roman truly was.</p>
<p>An apology was just an excuse in this situation. Daniel Cairo gritted his teeth at the blatant attitude of Kronos.</p>
<p>‘We are suffering this humiliation because we are a weak nation.’</p>
<p>His own father, the former King, wanted peace. As he grew up watching that kind of person, Daniel Cairo inherited his father’s benevolence, but when he faced the cruel reality, he realized how irresponsible his father was. As the King, he shouldn’t have done that.</p>
<p>If he faced a brutal situation against a predator like the Kronos Empire, he needed to have a strong national power to survive. The problem was that it was too late. Reality struck, and now the Kronos Empire is forcing them to make an unavoidable choice.</p>
<p>Everyone’s eyes were focused on Daniel Cairo. In a situation where no one could give any advice except for Simon, Daniel Cairo said with a firm expression,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is the Hero of Cairo. He did things for Cairo, and that fact is known to all the people in Cairo, including those present here. But what would happen if we abandoned such an existence just so we could live? We might be safe now, but that is all. The Kronos Empire will use this incident as a chance to cut down on our ways to live, and no one else will be willing to sacrifice their life for us. Because when the pillar called Roman Dmitry falls, Cairo is bound to collapse.”</p>
<p>It was a risky choice. Kronos wasn’t the type of nation that said empty words, and they wouldn’t let go of their decision to go to war.</p>
<p>But in the future, in the new Cairo, there would be no fights within the nation, nor would there be any neglect of talented people dedicated to the nation.</p>
<p>Even if the result was their ruin, it was Daniel Cairo’s responsibility. At least as the King of the Kingdom and as the person who allowed the decision to attack the Kronos Empire, Daniel Cairo didn’t avoid the responsibility.</p>
<p>“Summon Roman Dmitry right now. I will discuss this matter with him directly.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Two days later, Roman Dmitry arrived at the palace. Daniel Cairo couldn’t even greet him properly.</p>
<p>“… that is how things turned out. What should I do?”</p>
<p>He asked him honestly about Kronos’s offer. In the situation where his brain couldn’t give him the right answer, he needed someone to say something to him.</p>
<p>And Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“From now on, it is time for a new game. The Kronos Empire is aware of the fact that their proposal is out of touch with common sense. Nevertheless, their reason for forcing such a ridiculous choice is to deal with my existence and set the status of their empire right. If you accept their proposal, the future in which Cairo becomes under the control of the Kronos Empire is unavoidable.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know what to do either. However, we can’t just ignore the ones with power and move on. Just like what you said, if Kronos wants to set the status of the empire right, they will want us to fulfill one of the options they have given.”</p>
<p>The first option couldn’t be considered, so they were left with the second option—an all-out war with Kronos. Even assuming that Roman Dmitry was the best on the continent, there was no way they could defeat the empire with the power of Cairo alone.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. From the moment he made the decision to attack first, he already knew the answer.</p>
<p>“There is a way to avoid war while taking advantage of me. Please send an envoy to the Kronos Empire. I will directly go to the empire and solve the problem.”</p>
<p>“I cannot allow that. The Kronos Empire wants to punish you now. And if you go there on your own, in the worst case, you could lose your life.”</p>
<p>Roman’s suggestion was too bold. As he said, the problem could be solved, but it was impossible for them to let Roman Dmitry go. It was an irresponsible decision that he didn’t want to make.</p>
<p>The responsibility for the decision should be shared, but Roman’s proposal was no different from making him take full responsibility.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that one of the people in the palace who was listening to their conversation stepped forward and said,</p>
<p>“Can I say something?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry knows how to solve the problem. And Your Majesty considers it a risky choice for Roman Dmitry to visit the Kronos Empire. Wouldn’t it be enough for someone else from Cairo to be the envoy to Kronos? If there is such a person who can perfectly implement your plan, I think it will be an optimal agreement.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry intended to execute the plan himself. Just as Daniel Cairo took responsibility for the decision, Roman also had a different opinion.</p>
<p>But after confirming the voice of the owner, Roman knew that his words had power, and Daniel Cairo did as well. He nodded his head to show his agreement.</p>
<p>“Count Fabius. Does that mean you will go as the envoy to the Kronos Empire?”</p>
<p>“You are right. I will represent Cairo and convey our intentions to that heinous Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p>The Raccoon of Cairo—he opened up a new path.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 193 - New Map (3)</p>
<p>Fabius was like a bat. The kind of life he has lived until now has earned him the nickname the Raccoon of Cairo, and during the clash between Roman Dmitry and Marquis Benedict, he betrayed the nobles.</p>
<p>Some people criticized him for it. No matter how much he went after his own gains, seeing him betray the nobles’ faction, whom he had been with for a long time, he was more devoted to himself and his own growth. And that wasn’t wrong. Fabius wasn’t someone you could put your trust in, but that didn’t mean his abilities were lacking.</p>
<p>So Daniel Cairo thought that maybe Fabius might be the right person.</p>
<p>‘Fabius is one of the best people in Cairo when it comes to his political skills. He knows how to read the trend and make fast and bold choices. Even though he was a key figure in Marquis Benedict’s faction, his ability is clear, and his decision to stay by Roman Dmitry’s side proves he can be trusted.’</p>
<p>The problem was that they needed someone who excelled in diplomacy. In order to perfectly carry out Roman Dmitry’s plan, it was necessary for that person to have the courage to speak without trembling, even when entering the jaws of a beast.</p>
<p>And Fabius met that condition. Aside from simply being capable, Fabius was now looking for a chance to prove his skills.</p>
<p>In the new future, this would be the new trend. Count Fabius openly showed his intention to jump on the bandwagon for a bright future.</p>
<p>‘It isn’t a bad choice since his intention is clear. If each side achieves the goals they want, then the result is a lot better.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“The negotiation with Kronos isn’t a matter to be taken lightly. They are similar to magic bombs in a way that we do not know when they will be directed at us, and there is a possibility that they might break the Continental Law of not touching the envoy. We will reject the options they have given, and you will steer them in our direction. Your life could end the moment you utter a statement of refusal, so will you still take such a risk and leave for Kronos as the envoy?”</p>
<p>“I am ready to give up my life for Cairo. I will do my best to carry out the mission perfectly.”</p>
<p>He didn’t hesitate to answer. And so the final decision fell on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo looked at Roman Dmitry and asked him,</p>
<p>“I think Count Fabius is the right person for this job. What do you think, Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The meeting was over. Roman Dmitry, who was given a day to decide, walked with Count Fabius.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>And then he stopped walking. In a place far away from people, Roman Dmitry looked at Fabius.</p>
<p>“Tell me what you want.”</p>
<p>A Count and an heir to a noble family—even though the difference in their status was clear, both Roman Dmitry, who treated him normally, and Count Fabius, who listened to him, accepted the situation naturally. Ever since Count Fabius took the lead in punishing the nobles, regardless of their status, they naturally acted like a Lord and a subordinate.</p>
<p>The plan was laid out. Count Fabius lowered his head and said,</p>
<p>“In the last battle, I had the honor of standing as the vanguard for Roman Dmitry. It may be that I am being greedy, but I don’t want our relationship to have an abrupt end. This Fabius wants to live for Roman Dmitry. Please consider my act as an envoy to be an expression of my loyalty to Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>There was a rope in front of his eyes, and Count Fabius grabbed it tightly. Knowing all too well the negative prejudice against him, his loyalty was a little different from other people’s.</p>
<p>“I will not deny that I am a defector. No matter how much I prove my abilities and pledge allegiance, the basics will not change that. People say a person who has defected once is likely to do so again. I cannot predict the future either. Unlike the rest of Roman Dmitry’s followers, I cannot ask you to trust me blindly either, but I will take this chance to show you.”</p>
<p>He looked at Roman, and with determined eyes, he put strength into his voice.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to be treated the same way as the people that Mr. Roman Dmitry trusts. However, please use the man named Count Fabius in the future. Anything is fine. I am fine with being used as an envoy this time, and if you order it, I will even hug straws of rice and jump into a pit of fire. I will prove that I am not just a being who follows orders but a useful being who executes them properly. Promise me just one thing in return. Please be my support for wealth and honor, and as long as I get to live by your side, I am ready to do anything.”</p>
<p>Fabius’s proposal was straightforward. Rather than the normal relationship between a Lord and a subordinate, he wanted an exchange. If Roman Dmitry remains in power unless he falls down like Marquis Benedict, Fabius said he would be useful to Dmitry until the end.</p>
<p>‘Count Fabius’s decision is not accidental. He experienced war with me, and in the process, he learned what kind of person I am. He found out that instead of a one-sided feeling towards me, he wanted a relationship with benefits.’</p>
<p>It was ideal and fun. On the fierce battlefield, while Roman Dmitry swung his sword at the enemies, Count Fabius looked at Roman alone—how he behaved, what values he had, and what standards his relationships with those who followed him were formed by.</p>
<p>There were various characters, and they had different reasons for their allegiance. Chris hoped for power beyond Roman Dmitry, Kevin expressed his blind loyalty to the savior of his life, and Henderson longed for Roman Dmitry, who defeated the Blood Fang.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just an emotional exchange. Even Volkan and Pooky, both former mercenaries, were satisfied with the benefits they received from Roman Dmitry, and everyone had their own reasons to follow him.</p>
<p>He was sure of it. Roman Dmitry was at the center of everyone. Count Fabius knew right then how important it was to build a relationship with Roman and how to maintain a relationship that benefited him.</p>
<p>If….. If Roman Dmitry was similar to Benedict, Fabius would have put on a fake face and cried out his loyalty, but Roman was not Benedict. He honestly emphasized a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>“Please accept me.”</p>
<p>He was on his knees. He bowed his head and let go of his pride. The more he looked at him, the more he liked him. The appearance of having a solid foundation to lead someone—this was the answer he had been searching for.</p>
<p>“Count Fabius.”</p>
<p>He raised his head. Seeing him look up, Roman Dmitry showed an unwavering gaze.</p>
<p>“From now on, you are one of my people, and you will enjoy everything you want.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, after completing all the preparations, Count Fabius joined the delegation and headed for the Kronos Empire. They were running out of time. There was a time limit of ten days, so it was a bit of a forced march, but the delegation had no choice but to hurry.</p>
<p>While moving, a member of the delegation and a noble who followed the King asked,</p>
<p>“Count Fabius. How on earth can you survive betraying someone you love? I honestly don’t understand. Even if you sometimes fail, you have to succeed dozens of times to be recognized, and Roman Dmitry isn’t the type to tolerate failure. Most of all, didn’t you survive by moving to another powerful side this time too?”</p>
<p>It was an honest question, to which Fabius answered with a smile,</p>
<p>“There is something that people misunderstand. There is romance in betrayal.”</p>
<p>“Romance?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The so-called renegades tend to stick around without a solid spine and only seek gain. Such beings have no right to swear allegiance. Those in power already have people who have devoted themselves to them, but how can they survive if there are no such people among them?”</p>
<p>Driving his horse and looking through the plains, he thought of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“That is why I always give my heart. Despite knowing that a man named Fabius was a traitor, he asked me to prove my worth so he wouldn’t abandon me. It is a simple thing. There are people willing to risk their lives. If a person dares to make a decision that even the most loyal people would hesitate to make, but that person has a past of being a traitor, would the part about him being a traitor be the only thing you decide to listen to? For that one reason alone?”</p>
<p>“….no, I will probably keep him by my side and use him.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. You will use him. That one chance is how a traitor becomes a follower.”</p>
<p>Actually, their relationship wasn’t completely sincere. It was true that he was sincerely carrying out the orders, but that was what the other person wanted.</p>
<p>However, Roman was different. For the first time, he didn’t put on a mask and speak of loyalty, and Fabius mustered up the courage to speak about a mutually beneficial relationship.</p>
<p>‘I also don’t like this life of betrayal. If Marquis Benedict had stayed in power for the rest of his life, I would have stuck with him. The reason I live a life of betrayal is that there has been no one to whom I wanted to give my loyalty to. And Roman Dmitry is someone who is different from the others I had experienced with.’</p>
<p>It could be a hasty thought, but Count Fabius thought that he might have found someone to serve for the rest of his life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Capital of the Empire.</p>
<p>They had arrived in Alexander. Count Fabius, who was visiting the Empire for the first time, was shocked as he looked at the castle’s gate.</p>
<p>‘… is this an empire?’</p>
<p>There was a huge castle, and the scenery inside was shocking. The magnificent buildings, which couldn’t be seen in Cairo, and the strong-looking guards on the other side of the roads gave him goosebumps.</p>
<p>He scanned the surroundings with sharp eyes, and this proved just how powerful the empire was. It was so different from Cairo. Daniel Cairo was swayed by the nobles, but Kronos was a nation that respected the Emperor like a God.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>They passed through the gate, escorted by a knight. The pattern on his forearm proved that he was a member of the 7th Knight Troops, and yet the force this man held was unique. Every time their eyes met, it felt so intense that he gasped for breath.</p>
<p>Even if Count Fabius wasn’t a great swordsman, he could at least guess whether or not the other person was a strong being. He was sure of it—the Imperial Knights were stronger than Count Nicholas. He couldn’t be certain if the existence called Cairo’s First Sword could rival this man.</p>
<p>‘I have now entered an extraordinary world.’</p>
<p>His mouth felt dry. He hadn’t even met the Twelve Swords of the Continent yet. If he had been tasked to be his guide, then he was surely just a gatekeeper, but that alone completely overwhelmed Count Fabius.</p>
<p>And the reason why the envoy of Cairo was now in Kronos popped into his mind. Roman Dmitry took Gustavo’s life, the leader of the 10th unit of the Knights of Kronos, but such a result didn’t even seem to bother Kronos.</p>
<p>He took a step. As he entered the palace, which was the pinnacle of splendor, he passed through endless corridors before stopping in front of a huge door.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the Emperor, the envoy has arrived.”</p>
<p>The door didn’t open right away. It was the Emperor’s place. Even though the knight was simply looking at the door as he spoke, he bowed his head to the door and showed respect.</p>
<p>Even though Count Fabius was loyal to a different nation, he bowed to the huge door and didn’t dare look up until the Emperor’s voice could be heard from the other side.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened.</p>
<p>Count Fabius, who finally entered the room, trembled at the presence in front of him. It was the Emperor of the Empire. The sight of him looking down from the highest point made Count Fabius gulp.</p>
<p>‘… the moment I slip my words, I will die right here.’</p>
<p>His instincts warned him.</p>
<p>A giant who shouldn’t be touched—that was what Count Fabius thought of the Emperor of Kronos, whom he was meeting for the first time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 194 - New Map (4)</p>
<p>Is this what it feels like to be suffocated by intimidation? The Emperor of Kronos looked at Count Fabius in silence. He was huge enough to fill the throne and had a cold expression on his face.</p>
<p>Even if he cast off the guise of being the Emperor of Kronos, he would still be a 5-star aura swordsman. Although not officially registered in the Rankings, the presence that the Emperor had was enough to make the entire palace a mess.</p>
<p>Fabius walked slowly. He didn’t rush his steps until he reached the emperor, but he also didn’t dare to look up either.</p>
<p>The moment the door opened, the scene that came into view was too shocking. The key figures of Kronos were all lined up on both sides of the Emperor, and it showed how huge the mountain that Kronos was if one wanted to climb it.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He stopped walking. He bowed on behalf of the delegation, and then the Emperor asked,</p>
<p>“Are you Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“No. I am Count Fabius of Cai…”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>It happened in an instant. The moment Count Fabius revealed his identity, the Emperor of Kronos distorted his expression, and at the same time, the knight who guided Fabius grabbed him by the neck and made him fall to the ground.</p>
<p>He suppressed Fabius’s head by force, making it impossible for him to lift his head. And from above, he heard the voice of the Emperor.</p>
<p>“My representative made it clear. Negotiations are not possible, and if you do not want an all-out war with Kronos, Roman Dmitry should come and offer up his arm.”</p>
<p>“T-That…”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He couldn’t get a word out. The knight was pushing Count Fabius’s head with such great force that his words couldn’t help but die down. His heart was beating against the ground. He knew that the Emperor of Kronos was a man who loved war, but he didn’t think that an envoy would be treated like this.</p>
<p>“I understand the meaning of Cairo well. If you want an all-out war, I will show you the will of Kronos by cutting off your arm as the envoy.”</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>His heart fell, and his blood went cold.</p>
<p>‘If I don’t say anything now, Cairo cannot avoid an all-out war. I cannot even beg for anything here. My plan to be in the good graces of Roman Dmitry will be messed up, and his plan will fail. The problem is that if I become too aggressive, the Emperor might make a harsh decision, and our entire nation will be in trouble. I need to convey my words and the intention of Cairo without being too rude but not being too servile either.’</p>
<p>He shook his head. For a single decision, each word meant a lot. In a situation where his life could be in danger, Count Fabius felt like his senses sharpened.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the Emperor of Kronos! Cairo does not want an all-out war! Please give me a chance to speak. After I convey the will of Cairo, you may take my head and not just my arm!”</p>
<p>He risked his life. He shook off the hand that was pushing him down and raised his voice. But no answer came back. It felt like an eternity of silence passed where only his heart that was thumping so loud could be heard, and soon the Emperor of Kronos said,</p>
<p>“Remember what you just said. If Cairo cannot convince me, you will die on the spot.”</p>
<p>The knight stepped aside.</p>
<p>Fabius got his chance to speak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He got up. With a red face, he caught his breath and looked up at the Emperor of Kronos, his clothes all tangled.</p>
<p>He was afraid. His heart raced, but Count Fabius didn’t let fear get the best of him.</p>
<p>“Our reason for rejecting the offer that the Kronos Empire made is that Marquis Benedict’s rebellion didn’t have a justification in the first place. Marquis Benedict rebelled because his own safety was in danger, and his involvement with the Kronos Empire was not the right decision to make. We do not want an all-out war with Kronos, and we have decided that it isn’t worth sacrificing the talent of the kingdom for it.”</p>
<p>Kronos mentioned their justification the other day. Since the empire was drawn in by Cairo’s nobles, their attack was justified.</p>
<p>First of all, the most important thing was for them to deny that. His words just now were made under the assumption that the Kronos Empire didn’t break the Continental Laws.</p>
<p>“Cairo asked for the opinion of the International Community on this matter. There was a war between the nations for an unjust reason, and it was necessary for us to check if one side had the obligation to be made responsible for it. And the five kingdoms, apart from Valhalla, expressed their willingness to agree with Cairo. Your Majesty, the Emperor of Kronos. There was no reason for another nation to intervene in a war that started with a civil war. However, if you wish for Cairo to make a sacrifice, we have no choice but to be driven into a corner.”</p>
<p>It was a strange way of talking. By first saying that they had the consent of other kingdoms, it was like saying Cairo was being supported.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Roman Dmitry contacted the five kingdoms on the continent for the negotiations with the Kronos Empire to go smoothly. The conversation with them wasn’t so difficult.</p>
<p>The Kingdoms’ Alliance in the southern part of Kronos wanted a friendly relationship with Cairo because of their dispute with Kronos. At the same time, the Hector Kingdom decided that it was necessary to let go of their past bad relationship and unite their voices this time.</p>
<p>It was an incident in which the empire oppressed a kingdom for no reason. The empire is attacking Cairo now, but after that, which kingdom would they go after? That was Roman’s plan—to gather the power of the kingdoms.</p>
<p>Each kingdom had a struggling military power, but the story would be different if the six kingdoms chose to side with each other.</p>
<p>And Count Fabius said,</p>
<p>“Cairo wants peace. If the Kronos Empire wants war, show your will by cutting off my head. However, if you agree with Cairo, I hope this ends well.”</p>
<p>His speech was over. All their cards were placed on the table, and now it was Kronos’s turn to decide.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cairo’s intention was too clear. Gambling from the edge of a cliff, if they were pushed, they were saying that all the kingdoms would come together.</p>
<p>And there was something else in those words. The reason why the Valhalla Empire wasn’t included in the plan was that they were the evil partner of Kronos.</p>
<p>They were the two high mountains on the same continent. If the name of the Valhalla Empire had been uttered with threatening remarks, the Emperor of Kronos might have made an extreme choice even for the sake of the empire’s status. So the Valhalla Empire was excluded.</p>
<p>They said Valhalla had nothing to do with this incident, but that didn’t mean their existence was completely irrelevant.</p>
<p>‘If a war breaks out between Kronos and the Kingdoms’ Alliance, the Kronos Empire will surely win, but what happens after the war is over is the problem. The Kronos Empire, which had exerted a lot of energy to defeat the six kingdoms, would have to be very cautious about a war with Valhalla. We didn’t mention Valhalla, but they would have no choice but to be wary of them. This is the best option we can choose.’</p>
<p>It was a kind of intimidation. Touching the pride of the Emperor was said to be the best way to compromise. And by attracting other nations, they made it difficult for Kronos to touch them.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a great person. Fabius thought that strength could only be found in military power, but the plan that Roman Dmitry thought of was perfect. In the current situation, there was no better plan than this. The Kronos Empire was not ready to conquer the continent yet, and they did not want to hasten it.</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p>Count Fabius gulped. He trusted Roman Dmitry’s plan, but the presence of the Emperor of Kronos made his throat dry. It was then…</p>
<p>“You seem to have used your head quite a bit.”</p>
<p>He didn’t panic. It wasn’t even an angry voice. As if he had expected it, the Emperor turned to Count Fabius with an expressionless face. From the start until now, the Emperor of Kronos has not changed his expression much. So even if he was the Raccoon of Cairo, he couldn’t guess what his real emotions were.</p>
<p>“In exchange for freeing the captives of Kronos, I will end the problem here. But the treatment of Roman Dmitry is a separate issue.”</p>
<p>“… what is that supposed to mean?”</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry killed my people. Count Fabio, Gustavo, and the Knights of Kronos. They were all devoted to the empire, and as the Emperor, I want to be compensated in blood. Every night from now on, my people will visit Roman Dmitry. The crime of killing talented people from the empire—it is up to Roman Dmitry and the Cairo Kingdom to handle this issue.”</p>
<p>The Emperor of Kronos was a scary person. Cairo brought other nations into this issue, yet his desire for the blood of Roman Dmitry didn’t stop.</p>
<p>Assassination. How can he help him now? No matter how unfair this situation felt, he knew that there was a high chance that the death of Roman Dmitry would end in an assassination.</p>
<p>He felt goosebumps rise for a moment. The Emperor never wanted an all-out war with Cairo in the first place. It occurred to him that he had set up a plan to restore the status of his empire by driving Cairo into a corner and rescuing his men, along with assassinating Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Above the sky, his existence was above the heavens. The empire was called an empire for a reason.</p>
<p>“And from now on, the same things will not work.”</p>
<p>The Emperor said that, and Count Fabius felt lost.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, Fabius returned to Cairo. He went to the King and reported all the things that had happened and bowed to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… I apologize. A variable had popped up.”</p>
<p>The war was avoided. However, as someone who served Roman Dmitry, he couldn’t bring himself to talk about the assassination attempts that would happen in the future.</p>
<p>His face was red. As a traitor, he showed confidence when he left to prove himself, but in front of the giant, the Emperor, Fabius couldn’t find an answer. However…</p>
<p>“Well done.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t seem interested. He had already accepted the things that Count Fabius couldn’t say.</p>
<p>“The Kronos Empire never gave up on their decision. Their target had been me from the start, and it is very likely that they wouldn’t step back without a threat. You did your best for what I asked for.”</p>
<p>He had actually expected Kronos’s response.</p>
<p>‘Emperor Kronos. As expected, he is a belligerent person.’</p>
<p>If Roman Dmitry had gone as the envoy, even if he had spoken of assassination, he wouldn’t have killed him. It was more of a matter of pride than profit for the Emperor.</p>
<p>If he had allowed Roman Dmitry to live and killed him outside of the empire, the people would be intimidated by the influence of the empire. So Roman volunteered to go. Knowing that the Kronos Empire was similar to him, he knew that it wasn’t dangerous. Even if the worst scenario happened, Roman Dmitry had a way out.</p>
<p>“… are you sure you are fine? The Kronos Empire has spoken of assassination, and a swordsman of Valhalla who was once their target died.”</p>
<p>Count Fabius was concerned. It was to be expected. He trusted Roman Dmitry, but the name Kronos had its own weight.</p>
<p>But he didn’t know the truth. Roman Dmitry—no, Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, what kind of life did he live? Assassinations were a daily occurrence for him. Emperor Kronos’s intention to scare him was misguided right from the start.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter. That is my problem now.”</p>
<p>His blood boiled.</p>
<p>Finally, it felt like he was walking on knives after entering this world.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 195 - New Map (5)</p>
<p>It was a messy time. At the time when the Cairo Kingdom was changing rapidly, Count Gregory, who followed the Kronos Empire, was in prison.</p>
<p>At first, he kept being stubborn as he was being dragged by the soldiers. He yelled loudly, asking if the Kronos Empire would stay still when they would find out that he was being touched, but the situation was becoming worse as the days progressed.</p>
<p>“… is that true?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It is a mess outside. It is said that Roman Dmitry led the troops to the Benedict estate and eradicated the rebels. The Kronos Empire joined with the nobles to attack the Western Front, but the nobles fell so quickly that the Kronos Empire couldn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>“This.”</p>
<p>Inside the jail, one of Gregory’s men gave him the information. His heart sank with each piece of news. As Marquis Benedict’s long-time rival, he knew how well-prepared the man was for this kind of situation.</p>
<p>In addition, his castle was impregnable. Yet such a fortress was destroyed in just a few days, which meant that his own life was at stake. His last hope was the Kronos Empire. If they could take over the Western Front, there was a chance that they could compromise with the Cairo royal family. But…</p>
<p>“…the news just came in. I do not believe it either, but it didn’t just end with the Western Front defeating the Kronos Empire. They opened the gates and followed them out, killing Count Fabio, the commander, and Gustavo, the leader of the 10th unit of the Knights of Kronos. What should we do? Roman Dmitry has dealt with all the dangers of the kingdom.”</p>
<p>At that moment, his head spun. Count Gregory sat down and thought of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘That monster.’</p>
<p>He knew that guy was odd. He had such a strong presence that even a small well called Cairo was overflowing. Even when he thought that he overestimated the guy, the truth was that he underestimated him.</p>
<p>If the Kronos Empire stepped back, the nobles of the empires and the rebels would not be able to live in this land. And Count Gregory began to get anxious at that point. In a situation where death could fall on him at any time, he couldn’t just sit in prison doing nothing.</p>
<p>And it was finally the day the prison doors opened. During the time he was summoned by the King, a guard told him,</p>
<p>“Count Gregory, the Kronos Empire didn’t admit their wrongdoings and asked for Roman Dmitry’s arm for the crime of killing Count Fabio and Knight Gustavo.”</p>
<p>At those words, he smiled. There wasn’t any mention of him dying. And if Kronos wasn’t stepping back, then he might live.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count Gregory was brought before the King. As he knelt on the ground, he looked at Daniel Cairo with a calm face.</p>
<p>“Count Gregory, you colluded with the Kronos Empire and disturbed the peace of the nation. Do you admit this fact?”</p>
<p>It was the expected question. The moment he admits it, he will lose the power in his hands, and he might lose his head. But…</p>
<p>“I admit it.”</p>
<p>He didn’t step back. Looking straight into the eyes of the King, he said,</p>
<p>“It is an open fact that everyone knows that I follow the Kronos Empire. But is it wrong? Marquis Benedict, who rebelled, had paid for it, but not me. I had nothing to do with it, so why am I being treated like this?”</p>
<p>“So shameless. The fact that you admitted it is a sufficient reason to treat you as a traitor.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, you are mistaken. Since Marquis Benedict is from Cairo, it would not be a problem to punish him for treason, but I am someone who has sworn my allegiance to the Kronos Empire. Even if I am a noble in Cairo, I am not in the same position as Marquis Benedict. If you kill me here, will the Kronos Empire stand still? They are hunters. They are even angry that their knight was killed on the battlefield, so how do you think they will respond to my death?”</p>
<p>His attitude changed. There was no way he could live silently. If he had the Kronos Empire behind him, he would make use of it.</p>
<p>“His Majesty, Emperor Kronos, seeks bloody vengeance. If you kill me, you will have to pay a price, so why don’t you just send me to the empire? If you don’t want blood on your hands, then get rid of the dangers in Cairo. We can do that for each other.”</p>
<p>He kept his head up and looked at the King with wide eyes. Even though he was kneeling for his sins, through his eyes, he was showing that he was still higher than Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>The threat worked. At those words, the King’s expression crumbled.</p>
<p>‘… he isn’t completely wrong.’</p>
<p>Fabius returned, and he learned of the pride that the empire had. Daniel Cairo was worried about Roman, but there was nothing he could do about it. In addition, there was no one else other than the Royal Knights who could protect the kingdom. The opponent was the Kronos Empire, a horrible monster that was much stronger than Count Nicholas.</p>
<p>And so guilt took over him. He was sure that it was the right choice for the kingdom, but he felt it was unfair for Roman to pay the price. From start to finish, Roman did everything for him. If he hadn’t defeated the nobles and the Kronos Empire, then Cairo would have been destroyed, but he couldn’t just let Roman pay for the price alone. There was no solution.</p>
<p>Count Gregory touched the King’s soft spot. The empire’s faction—he wanted to kill all of them. However, thinking that their anger toward Roman might grow, he didn’t want to say anything. He was certainly a King, but he was a weak one.</p>
<p>In the situation where he had to make a decision, he felt confused. At that moment, he turned to Roman Dmitry, and their eyes met.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was silent. Roman Dmitry stepped forward and asked,</p>
<p>“Can I say something?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Emperor Kronos is not the type of person who takes back what he says. If he said he would make me pay with blood, then it means that he would send people to assassinate me. But it has already happened. Aside from the problems you have to deal with from now on, what is there to be afraid of when I was just warned about being killed? Count Fabio and Knight Gustavo—they are people with good names and worth that Count Gregory cannot be compared to. If so, make a decision and lighten the burden on Cairo.”</p>
<p>Gregory was shocked. And cutting him off before he says anything, Roman Dmitry raises his voice,</p>
<p>“From the moment the ones committing treason were killed, the peace of Cairo has passed. Your Majesty, your choice paves the path we will move towards. Even if Your Majesty’s people die because of it, it will be the right decision to make, and no one will resent that choice. There is no war in which no one dies. If you weigh the lives of your people and let go of something important, then the situation becomes irreversible.”</p>
<p>The leaders present at the Cairo Royal Palace were at a loss for words. Why? Why was Roman Dmitry so fearless? Even though the Kronos Empire spoke of his assassination so openly, there was no fear in Roman Dmitry’s voice.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo gulped. The weak King was always shaken, but he tried to face reality until the end.</p>
<p>“Cairo owes a great deal of debt to the Dmitry family. Even if this choice makes you the target of assassination, the royal family will not forget Dmitry’s devotion.”</p>
<p>Then he shifted his gaze to Count Gregory. Looking at his puzzled face, he said,</p>
<p>“Count Gregory. Your collusion with the Kronos Empire wasn’t enough. You even dared to reveal the facts in front of us, thus tarnishing Cairo’s honor. Cairo’s chaos has stemmed from neglecting such things. Marquis Benedict, Count Gregory, and Count Denver. From the moment you people only cared about your own interests regardless of the safety of the nation, Cairo fell into absolute chaos.”</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! There is some misunderstanding…”</p>
<p>“Shut up!”</p>
<p>His face was red. Daniel Cairo was no longer a young King. Due to the ongoing fights and after meeting Roman Dmitry, something changed in his heart. He made a decision as King.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo’s eyes were cold.</p>
<p>“Count Gregory, the traitor, will be sentenced to death for endangering the nation.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Life was both easy and difficult. Cairo suffered for a long time due to the messy power system, but with Daniel Cairo’s decision, things started to change, and two people would climb the guillotine. At the end of Count Gregory and Count Denver, those who followed them didn’t dare protest.</p>
<p>People flocked to the square in Cairos. But before heading there, Count Denver looked at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“… I was a fool. If I had recognized you as a threat to the empire right from the start, I would have dealt with you before this happened. If it weren’t for you, Cairo would have been torn to pieces and walked down to its chaos.”</p>
<p>Count Gregory was silent. Unlike him, who only looked at the ground in pain, Count Denver hasn’t given up yet.</p>
<p>“Even now, you can swear your allegiance to the empire. Right now, you must be under the illusion of being great, but you are nothing compared to the empire. Knight Gustavo? In Cairo, he is higher than Count Nicholas, but by the standards of the continent, he is just at the 78th. There are so many stronger people in the empire, and you cannot surpass them. Do you think you can handle those monsters?! Are you sure you can stop them if they try to kill your family?”</p>
<p>His voice gained strength. The King had already given the verdict, but he was sure that if Roman changed his mind, he could live.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. You are not stupid. One choice in life determines everything. If you remain a man of Cairo, all your future choices will turn into hardships. But the empire can put wings on your back. Think wisely. Even if you had crossed the river, which you shouldn’t have with Kronos, Valhalla would give you a chance. And if my head is cut off, your chances are over.”</p>
<p>It was his last chance, but no reply came back. Count Denver gritted his teeth in anger as he said,</p>
<p>“The day will surely come when you will regret the choice you made today. The Valhalla Empire will make you pay the price for my life. With one choice, you are turning both mountains into your enemies.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He stopped walking. This scene was something Roman was used to. The words spoken by losers were always the same, and when they struggled and failed, a loss of hope could be seen in their eyes. Just like Count Gregory, who had given up on everything.</p>
<p>As he looked at Count Denver, who still believed he was right, Roman Dmitry smiled.</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>
<p>Right, that was it. Those should be the last words a loser should hear, and Count Denver was dragged away with trembling eyes. And then…</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>He died in front of everyone’s eyes.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 196 - Dmitry Duchy (1)</p>
<p>Among the four factions within Cairo, three of them had walked the path of downfall. Those who participated in the rebellion, such as Marquis Benedict, suffered a bloody purge without anyone being exempted, and the future of those who followed Count Gregory and Denver depended on the severity of their mistakes.</p>
<p>Of course, those who actively acted as puppets didn’t get the same fate as the rebels, but those who stayed on the right side were able to save their lives.</p>
<p>The civil war turned the nation into a mess. The number of those who had to be punished just for joining a faction was too great, so they had to decide who could be forgiven and who couldn’t. It was a decision that everyone agreed on.</p>
<p>In their hearts, they wanted them to pay the price, but if they did that, Cairo’s power would weaken. So instead, Daniel Cairo, who finished the issue by freeing the captives of Kronos, prepared a grand ceremony for those who believed in him until the end.</p>
<p>The people gathered in front of the Cairo Royal Palace, and in front of them, the names of the heroes who saved the nation were spoken out loud and given awards.</p>
<p>“Count Vandenberg, the commander of the Western Front, confidently defeated the enemies despite the attack of Kronos and raised the status of Cairo. Accordingly, I, Daniel Cairo, will bestow the title of Marquis to Count Vandenberg and grant him land and the power he deserves.”</p>
<p>It was an extraordinary greeting. It was a position that only two people in the kingdom held. After the death of one of them, the position had to be given to another person. And…</p>
<p>“On the Western Front, besides Count Vandenberg, there were heroes who risked their lives against the Kronos Empire. Baron Noel, Flora Lawrence… Rodwell Dmitry did an amazing job on the Western Front, and I will give each of them a promotion and a reward of 1,000 gold.”</p>
<p>“Ohhh!”</p>
<p>“Woah!”</p>
<p>People were shocked. The rewards given to the Western warriors were not stingy. Besides that, the words continued. Not just those who had defeated Kronos but also those who had helped in the plan to put down the rebellion were naturally included in the list. The King’s people, including Count Fabius, and the people of Roman Dmitry were included.</p>
<p>It was a festive time. The people cheered, and their expectations for one person began to rise. Roman Dmitry, what kind of reward would be given to him? According to common sense, it would be right to give him the best treatment, but there were too many rumors going around.</p>
<p>“Daniel Cairo has taken back the power in Cairo by subduing the factions, but with Roman Dmitry alive, does it mean anything? Roman Dmitry’s troops are stronger than the three factions. Maybe he will form a force that takes down the royal family at once, but that isn’t going to stop them from giving him a reward. The royal family is holding on to his existence right now. It is a bit cruel, but they might have to cut down Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>At the transfer of power, Roman Dmitry was at the center. The great abilities he had demonstrated were now a danger to the royal family. And just like how the royal family was unable to handle the three factions, it was clear that Roman Dmitry would turn into a being that the royal family couldn’t touch.</p>
<p>The rumors began to increase. Despite rising to power thanks to Roman Dmitry, they thought Daniel Cairo would betray the man. The eyes of the people were focused. And looking into their eyes, Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“We couldn’t have won this war without Roman Dmitry’s help and the Dmitry family as well. I, Daniel Cairo, recognize their merits and grant the title of Duke to the Dmitry family, and I recognize that the area of the northeast, including the land of Dmitry, will be declared a Duchy. In addition, I promise to provide them with the necessary knowledge and power so that they can establish themselves as a nation.”</p>
<p>The King’s words put an end to all the doubts.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It wasn’t like he didn’t know about the dangers of this decision. However, at the meeting held in the Royal Palace, all of those from the royal faction spoke in unison.</p>
<p>“We won the war thanks to Roman Dmitry. He deserves a fair reward.”</p>
<p>“Yes. You are right. Currently, the most horrid rumors are going around in Cairo, but we cannot let those words enter our ears and abandon the favor we have been given. We lived in a world where chaos was everywhere. It was a world where the four factions spoke over Your Majesty’s voice, and those who devoted themselves to the nation were not treated appropriately. If you make the same decision this time, the past is bound to happen again. We have to give what the people want, and that is expected.”</p>
<p>They also knew it. This one decision meant that Roman Dmitry would be out of their control. Even so, those who had lived in an unconventional world wanted Cairo to make the right decision.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo said,</p>
<p>“My thoughts are the same as yours. It doesn’t matter that the Dmitry family has enough power to surpass the three factions.”</p>
<p>During the series of events, Daniel Cairo saw and felt things he had never experienced until then. The layer of experiences piled up on the heart of the young king, and his own standard went up.</p>
<p>“The future of Cairo starts with acknowledging the reality. Dmitry is not something Cairo can control. Even if we try to keep them under our control, by defeating Marquis Benedict, they have proven that their power is beyond Cairo’s. Then it is appropriate to regard Dmitry as a Duchy and a friendly nation with equal footing.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a military relationship. Dmitry could regard Cairo as a military ally, but Cairo would never take their alliance for granted.</p>
<p>“Cairo has faced both internal and external enemies. External forces are infesting outside the borders, and the ones inside want to sell out the nation and threaten its safety. If only we would step away from being greedy in subduing Dmitry. Cairo has a firm shoulder on its side with Dmitry as an ally, as long as Cairo doesn’t cross the line.”</p>
<p>He no longer trembled. His mind felt clear, and he could see the way forward. He would keep his promise. And through his relationship with Dmitry, he planned to sketch the future of a new Cairo.</p>
<p>“I want to make use of this hard-earned opportunity. We are a small nation. A nation that cares about its people. Recognizing Dmitry as our ally from the start is a new beginning. People might think we are losing a huge amount of land, but by realizing their existence, we get the chance to build ourselves. The day that Dmitry officially declares itself a nation will be the start.”</p>
<p>He looked at the people. The Cairo royal family showed its desire for the first time.</p>
<p>“I, Daniel Cairo, will be happy with that.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The process and the proclamation of the Dmitry Dutchy came a week later. A ceremony and a party were scheduled in Dmitry, and at some point, rumors about Roman Dmitry spread.</p>
<p>“I am telling you it is him.”</p>
<p>“I told you. From the time he defeated the Hector Kingdom on the Southern Front, Roman Dmitry was no longer the eldest son of a Baron’s family. Even the King acknowledged him. Cairo ended the long-running power struggle against the three factions and even defeated the Kronos Empire in a matter of days, so how can anyone oppose him?”</p>
<p>“But how far can Roman Dmitry grow? I heard that he won against Kronos’s Knight Gustavo.”</p>
<p>At first, they admired him. The people of Cairo cheered at Roman Dmitry’s achievements, and then more rumors spread across the continent—just how great Dmitry truly was. Seeing what happened in the past, they emphasized that the Hero of Cairo was not a frog in a well.</p>
<p>“Is there anyone else in the world who has grown so much like Roman Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“I assure you, there is no other monster like him. Even the one called the Greatest Sword of the Continent didn’t reach the 5-star level at Roman Dmitry’s age. He cannot be touched.”</p>
<p>“… perhaps, for the first time on the continent, a swordsman from the kingdom who can surpass the Demon’s 50th has appeared.”</p>
<p>The Demon’s 50th was the limit for the people of the kingdom, be it Count Nicholas or others. The people from the kingdom have never been named above it, and so Roman Dmitry’s name became a hot topic.</p>
<p>If he had the power to defeat Gustavo even when he was still in his 20s, then his potential for growth was extreme, and people predicted that he might surpass the 50th place before he even turned 30 years old.</p>
<p>Was it because of his unusual moves? People from the continent spoke of Roman Dmitry, and everyone was talking about him everywhere, even in the shabbiest pubs. Those who had finished their day tilted their beer mugs and pretended to wield swords as if they were Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And on the streets, bards would sing songs about him. Outside Cairo, Roman was being treated like a celebrity despite not knowing about it. And the more they talked about him, the higher his status rose.</p>
<p>Even though he was from a Baron’s family in Cairo, his potential and achievements during the civil war changed everything. Cairo even dared to say that they would recognize Dmitry as a nation. And the people’s interest in Roman Dmitry was directly connected to Dmitry.</p>
<p>It was said that his family, which would bring huge chaos to the continent, had taken its first step as a Duchy, so everyone on the continent turned their attention to Dmitry.</p>
<p>However, the series of rumors was not very natural. Of course, it was true that rumors began to get exaggerated, but they all started in a mansion in Cairos.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>In a mansion in Cairos, a man received a report from his subordinate.</p>
<p>“The reactions are increasing from all over the continent. The main cause was the hired merchants who spread the rumors and the bards who were made to sing songs about Roman Dmitry being a hero. Now, even those outside Cairo know of Roman Dmitry. After all, the Lord’s plan was perfect.”</p>
<p>Just like his subordinate said, this was planned. Roman Dmitry’s name could be heard everywhere, yet the man wasn’t happy.</p>
<p>“No, this will not do. Roman Dmitry accomplished things that no one else could do in their lifetime. He defeated the Hector Kingdom on the Southern Front and took control of the messy Northeast, and this time, he caught the rebels and defeated the Kronos Empire. Just two years. That was the time it took for a Baron family to change into a Duchy.”</p>
<p>Not a single one of Roman’s achievements was easy. It was because only the big events were mentioned, but if one looked at them closely, so many things happened. The Star of Hector, Edwin Hector, Butler, Nicholas, and even Gustavo, who were ranked in the Continental Rankings.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s action had been odd to the extent that Homer, who was the first one he defeated, was being forgotten.</p>
<p>“Those who know Roman Dmitry’s success do not know of his growth. But some people tend to look down on what happened at the little well called Cairo. It’s those people we’re aiming for. From one end of the continent to the other, everyone should look up to Roman Dmitry. In order for him to become a hero recognized by the continent, we must spread his achievements for everyone to know and not just take small steps forward.”</p>
<p>He was thirsty and desperate. The man said,</p>
<p>“Ask the family to secure funds and release more people to do this. Rumors are a form of a messenger’s battle. The more one talks about Roman Dmitry, the more often people talk about him.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The subordinate lowered his head and left the room. The room was now silent, and the man grinned while thinking of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. Meeting you was a stroke of luck that I will never have again in my life.”</p>
<p>The identity of the man—he was none other than Henry Albert, the guy from the Southern Front.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 197 - Dmitry Duchy (2)</p>
<p>Henry Albert. How did he live all these years? Well, at first, he was doing just a simple job. As Roman Dmitry’s actions attracted people’s attention, the value of Henry Albert, his point of contact on the Southern Front, also increased.</p>
<p>The fact that he was from the Albert family, which was declining, didn’t matter. He was asked to lecture at the Cairo Royal Academy, which he wouldn’t have even dared to look at, and got the chance to teach the children of famous noble families.</p>
<p>At that time, he didn’t say anything about what happened on the Southern Front and how Roman Dmitry defeated the Hector Kingdom. He just shared what he saw and heard, and the students couldn’t take their eyes off him.</p>
<p>His life had changed so much. Children from noble families approached him to ask for his signature and looked up to him as if he were a hero. They didn’t know the truth. However, the mere fact that Henry Albert was there and experienced war made him appear to be a hero.</p>
<p>Just from one lecture, there was an explosive reaction, and more lectures lined up. Henry Albert just hoped to conduct regular lectures at the Royal Academy in Cairo, but now he was even being given the chance to stand on every high podium too.</p>
<p>But, of course, there was a price to pay. At first, people simply attended the lectures to spend some time knowing the story, but with time, people began to pay money to have Henry Albert speak.</p>
<p>Was it said that one’s position is what makes him a man? People could now recognize him when he walked down the street, so even Henry Albert, who had lived like a fool all his life, began to walk with confidence and a straight back.</p>
<p>He began to study because he was worried the students would ask him difficult questions during his lectures, and he tried to make himself look knowledgeable. Thanks to that, wealth and fame followed.</p>
<p>Everyone in his family was proud of him, and from that point on, they didn’t have to worry about money. Just one lecture brought in tens of gold. Some people would even give him one hundred gold.</p>
<p>“Ah, I am so happy.”</p>
<p>In only half a year, he managed to buy a luxurious mansion in Cairos. In the mansion that he purchased with the help of his acquaintances, whom he met from the lectures, and the nobles living close by, Henry was called a good noble neighbor. He now had the ideal life that he once imagined.</p>
<p>However, Henry Albert, who was sitting on a cozy sofa, suddenly felt like this comfort was all an illusion. In truth, he was nothing. He was lucky enough to live this kind of life, but it wouldn’t be strange at all if everything vanished the next day.</p>
<p>Happiness and unhappiness always go hand in hand. At first, he just enjoyed his happy life, but whenever anxiety rose, he would turn to alcohol. And one day, Henry Albert faced a truly shocking moment.</p>
<p>“Henry Albert. As I listened to your lectures, I couldn’t control my beating heart. It was thanks to the heroes on the Southern Front that Cairo was safe like this. Why are the people in this place not showing their gratitude? Thanks to you, I have come to know the reality of the world. From now on, I will contribute to the defense of Cairo and tell everyone how nice the lectures of Henry Albert are.”</p>
<p>He was a man in his late 60s. With gray hair and a beard, he was a leading professor at the Cairo Royal Academy. He was a man who was recognized for his skills, and such a person looked up to Henry.</p>
<p>It was so shocking. The children might not know much about him, but someone who was older and well-educated was looking up to him.</p>
<p>At that moment, Henry Albert had a realization.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His lectures—were they great? No, definitely not. The reason why people nodded their heads, cheered at every word he said, and went to see him as fans were entirely thanks to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>At first, he took advantage of the fame. However, when Roman Dmitry occupied the northeastern area, and the reactions towards him turned more passionate, he had to admit that things had changed.</p>
<p>The people’s interest in him came from Roman Dmitry. The more fame he gained, the more people wanted to know about Henry Albert, and the more he benefited from it.</p>
<p>‘Why are people going insane about me?’</p>
<p>That was what he thought. Why were his actions and words taken seriously when there were many other people on the Southern Front? The answer was simple—the contact with Daniel Cairo.</p>
<p>When he was reporting back from the Southern Front, Henry Albert once took on the role of relaying information on behalf of Roman Dmitry. And it wasn’t because he was important.</p>
<p>Except for Roman Dmitry, there was no other noble who could face the King there, and so it was his face that appeared on the screen. At that moment, people realized that Henry Albert had taken on the role of Roman’s voice. And unlike the others who had served on the Southern Front, Henry Albert had a clear record.</p>
<p>‘People are projecting Roman Dmitry through me. They do not know who I am, but they consider me great because I took on the role of relaying Roman Dmitry’s message. It’s funny. When I was called the fool of the family, people looked down on me no matter how hard I worked, and even though I am still the same person now, the attitude they have toward me is different. It isn’t because they are stupid. Even the professors in the academy look up to me.’</p>
<p>Just one fact changed his life. Even if he wasn’t so great, he had the confidence to live a great life.</p>
<p>‘If I look back in the past, there have been heroes who made a name for themselves in the world. How did they all get their reputation? It wasn’t because they made some great achievements. It was because their neighbors talked about them. They became famous because many people shared stories about them. What I need to do to hold onto this wealth is now clear. It is to announce the achievements of Roman Dmitry to the world. If he continues to remain great like he is now, the fact that I shared a moment of joy and sorrow with him on the battlefield will give me a comfortable life.’</p>
<p>Spreading rumors wasn’t difficult because Roman Dmitry was constantly talked about.</p>
<p>The Hector Kingdom and the Dmitry Alliance. From the Public Ranking Match to the Civil War, the grounds were overflowing with talks. He just made them all known to the people, and everyone considered Roman Dmitry a hero. As a result, Henry Albert naturally turned into an ally of the hero.</p>
<p>He laid down on the sofa.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. I am not as great as people think. But you continue to live the life that others look up to. I will let the world know who you are for the sake of my comfortable life.”</p>
<p>Top quality wine was sweet. The mansion he lived in, the sofa, and the wine—they were proof that Henry was on the right path. It was the new life of the guy who was once called a fool.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Henry’s methods worked. Thanks to the rumors that were circulating, attention on Roman Dmitry increased. And, of course, the biggest concern was the declaration of the Dmitry Duchy.</p>
<p>During the time when Roman, the hero of Cairo, was taking his first step into history, even people from other nations expressed their intention to attend the proclamation ceremony. All of them were longing to hear more about Roman Dmitry. Even if the rumors were only half true, it was worth the distance.</p>
<p>Days before the announcement, Dmitry was distracted by people flocking from all over the continent. In particular, the Knights’ Captain Jonathan, who was in charge of guarding the castle’s gate, showed admiration as he confirmed the faces of the people.</p>
<p>‘To see so many people from other nations flocking to see Roman Dmitry. There are even key figures from other nations among them. People from the Frank Kingdom came yesterday, and the representatives from the three kingdoms of the alliance arrived this morning. That just shows that the Kingdoms’ Alliance acknowledges Dmitry’s existence.’</p>
<p>It was such a new feeling. Until a few years ago, Dmitry was just a bug in the Northeast. The nobles wouldn’t recognize them since they originated as a commoner’s family, and when Jonathan swore his allegiance to Dmitry, his friends were shocked.</p>
<p>It was a natural reaction. As a 3-star aura swordsman, his future was guaranteed, but his choice was what they didn’t understand.</p>
<p>But now things had changed. Dmitry’s value soared to the point where his colleagues asked if they still had any vacancies.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. It is all thanks to him.’</p>
<p>He knew it as well. Baron Romero’s greed wasn’t that great, so they might still have had a bad relationship with Barco if Roman hadn’t stepped forward and made a change.</p>
<p>A change made by one man. It changed everyone’s attitude towards them, and Dmitry’s people were no longer bowing their heads because they were commoners. Their existence became great.</p>
<p>All those who went to visit Dmitry wanted to meet one person, and Roman Dmitry became the pride of Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘Jonathan. Keep your mind straight, and do not get drunk with joy.’</p>
<p>With that in mind, he chose to be the sword that protects Dmitry. He had to prepare for unexpected variables.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, as he carefully inspected the visitors, his eyes widened when he discovered an unexpected person.</p>
<p>“… you are?!”</p>
<p>The man in front of him was not someone who deserved to be in Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Baron Romero summoned his two sons.</p>
<p>‘Before the announcement of Dmitry becoming a Duchy, I need to settle the issue of succession. If I give more hope to everyone halfway, there will be problems after the dukedom has been declared.’</p>
<p>A conflict between blood relatives was not an outcome he wanted. Some fathers watched their sons compete and passed everything to the winner, but he didn’t want that. In fact, his mind was already tilted to one side.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry had dedicated his entire life to the family since he was a child, but could he be sure that if he declared him as the successor, there wouldn’t be any resistance from other family members?</p>
<p>So he called for a meeting. The youngest wasn’t invited because he wasn’t competing in the succession.</p>
<p><em>Knock. Knock.</em></p>
<p>“Father, may I come in?”</p>
<p>“Come in.”</p>
<p>The door opened, and at the sight of the two siblings entering, Baron Romero showed a heavy expression.</p>
<p>“The reason I have called you all here is to clear up the issue with the succession. As you all know, in a few days, the Dmitry estate will be declared a dukedom. It doesn’t simply mean that we will become more powerful; our responsibilities will change. Many lives will depend on us. That is why I want to make a decision right now.”</p>
<p>He spoke in a loud voice. This position was for the head of the Dmitry house.</p>
<p>Baron Romero looked at Rodwell Dmitry. The fact that he had to say something bad to his son, who had lost an eye on the battlefield, made him uncomfortable.</p>
<p>Actually, he had a right to the position. If he said that the decision was unfair, then he would just summon the main people of the estate and conduct a fair election.</p>
<p>It was at that moment…</p>
<p>“Father. I have something to say first.”</p>
<p>Rodwell said.</p>
<p>When Baron Romero looked at him with a questioning look, he said with a calm face,</p>
<p>“I will give up the position of the successor. Rather than me, Brother Roman is a better fit for it.”</p>
<p>When he arrived at Dmitry after the war, he had been through a lot in the last few days.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 198 - Dmitry Duchy (3)</p>
<p>Dmitry—it was the home that he hadn’t returned to in a long time. Rodwell, who had left to prove himself in the capital, recalled the past.</p>
<p>‘How many years has it been?’</p>
<p>He couldn’t remember it. What was certain was that the environment outside Dmitry wasn’t a good place to live in. Obviously, he was sure that when he returned, there would still be the stench of slums and shabby houses. However, now there was a nicely built village.</p>
<p>He couldn’t find the people with dark and despondent expressions anymore. There were well-fed and well-brought-up children running around with smiles.</p>
<p>And then he turned to the castle walls of Dmitry, which were so overwhelming to look at. It looked a lot higher than before. Not just that, but it had become a structure ready for battle with defensive magic circles and devices on it.</p>
<p>‘A lot had happened.’</p>
<p>While he was away, Dmitry was caught up in the whirlwind of war. There was the fight with Barco, the trouble with the Lords of the North, who tried to conquer the Northeast, and then the commander of the rebels, Marquis Benedict, showed his intention of attacking Dmitry.</p>
<p>Because of those events, Dmitry changed over and over again. If at one time it felt outlandish, then Dmitry is now a place that could be called a kingdom.</p>
<p>The war ended, and Rodwell Dmitry was ordered to take leave. Dmitry was now a dukedom, but that didn’t separate them from Cairo. The parts bordering other nations, like the West and the South, were decided to be common defense points, and he was told that he could continue his life in the West if he wanted to.</p>
<p>In addition, since he was promised a promotion for his contribution to the war, when he returns now, he will be at the level of a captain.</p>
<p>He was at a crossroads of choice. Would he stay in Dmitry? Or would he head to the West again?</p>
<p>Returning to Dmitry to make up his mind, he set aside his emotions and entered the gates, and he was impressed. It was so different from what he remembered.</p>
<p>“… what happened here?”</p>
<p>The nicely built roads and buildings—it was an incredible development for a city on the border, and the most eye-catching part was Dmitry’s soldiers.</p>
<p>He already felt it when he entered, but the soldiers who were just patrolling were so well-trained. They made minimal movements and had sharp eyes. Their refusal to allow anything wrong to happen reminded him of Roman’s men on the battlefield.</p>
<p>He was sure of it—they had all changed. They were not just mediocre soldiers on the outskirts, but they were now comparable to those of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Rodwell walked down the streets. Everything was so unfamiliar to him. It hadn’t been that long since he left Dmitry, and this change wasn’t something he could accept right away.</p>
<p>He needed some time to understand all of this. He went into an unknown diner, took a seat, and listened to what people were saying while sipping beer.</p>
<p>“Hehehe. Did that happen?”</p>
<p>“It did. Because a rookie made a mistake, all of us almost got buried under the tunnel. If Mr. Roman Dmitry hadn’t ensured the safety of that place, I wouldn’t be here either.”</p>
<p>“Right. I haven’t heard of anyone dying ever since the relics were installed in the mines.”</p>
<p>“It’s all thanks to Mr. Roman Dmitry that my life was saved.”</p>
<p>“Cheers!”</p>
<p><em>Tak!</em></p>
<p>They bumped their beer mugs. Those who seemed to be miners in the iron mine were talking about Roman Dmitry, and the situation at the other tables wasn’t much different. Roman Dmitry was always at the center of what they talked about.</p>
<p>Hearing about Roman Dmitry’s performance on the battlefield, they seemed to feel immense pride in being a member of Dmitry.</p>
<p>One city was so lively. Dmitry managed to secure jobs for the villagers in the mine, and the money earned from it was being used for people’s consumption.</p>
<p>Naturally, the people were enjoying it. And since they knew that Roman Dmitry was the reason they could live this way, they never stopped talking about him.</p>
<p>There was a gap in his memory. Before Rodwell left this place, his older brother was made fun of.</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>He drank the beer, and then….</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He put down the drink and got up. The taste was so bitter.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The same night, Rodwell Dmitry couldn’t sleep. The second son of a Baron’s family—why did he work so diligently? There was no amazing reason for it.</p>
<p>He tried his best to simply become a person suitable for Dmitry, but the world changed while he was away. Roman Dmitry, whom everyone joked about, no longer existed. When he saw and heard those things on the streets, he realized just how much Dmitry’s people respected Roman Dmitry now.</p>
<p>He was devastated, and his mind felt complicated. The current Dmitry estate knew more about Roman Dmitry than he did.</p>
<p>“… seriously like a beggar.”</p>
<p>His efforts in the past qualified him to become the successor. Roman Dmitry was sleeping when he trained with the sword. He would drink while Rodwell studied, and Roman would meet women when Rodwell raised his voice toward the guards. So, everyone assumed that Rodwell Dmitry would become the family’s successor.</p>
<p>Even when he left Dmitry, people said that fact wouldn’t change, and now they couldn’t hide the uncomfortable look on their faces as they met him after such a long time. They felt bad since their hearts were now tilted toward Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>It was the cruel reality. He was saddened by the collapse of the things he had worked hard for. However, Rodwell didn’t resent them. Hadn’t he already seen the results? Dmitry developed, the people were living a happy life, and their Baron family was now a Duchy.</p>
<p>Each of his actions was spotless. So Roman Dmitry seemed to be better suited to be the successor.</p>
<p>‘And I lost my eye.’</p>
<p>Having just one eye felt like a cold truth. Losing an eye as a swordsman was so much different than he thought. The sword felt so foreign to him in every direction he moved it, and even his sense of distance wasn’t entirely accurate.</p>
<p>He looked at the sky. It was such a dark night, like his own future.</p>
<p>‘There is no place for me in Dmitry. And even if I go back to the West, I will not become someone whom they want me to be.’</p>
<p>It was a dead end. Honestly, regardless of the reason, Rodwell Dmitry couldn’t forget what Roman Dmitry looked like on the battlefield.</p>
<p>Other people would have only heard of it by hearsay. However, unlike them, who only talked about Roman dealing with Gustavo, Rodwell witnessed it in person with his own two eyes.</p>
<p>The power he held was so shocking. Seeing him splatter blood every time he blinks, he gave up his position to be the successor right then.</p>
<p>The Dmitry Duchy. They were not a Baron’s family anymore. In order to rule the Northeastern region, Roman Dmitry was more suited to be the successor. He organized his thoughts throughout the night.</p>
<p>One day, two days.</p>
<p>As he was spending time alone, he was summoned by his father, so he went to his office. And then he spoke of the conclusion he had reached after much thought.</p>
<p>“I am not saying that I will yield simply because he is the eldest son. After arriving in Dmitry and observing the lives of the people, I have learned that the majority of the people already accepted him as the successor, and I do not blame my time in the capital. Even if I had stayed in Dmitry, I wouldn’t have shown what Brother Roman did, and it might have just hastened the decision of the people compared to now. Father. For the future of Dmitry, I don’t want to talk about that. And….”</p>
<p>Dmitry’s genius and Dmitry’s future had lost his path. He looked up at Baron Romero with a face different from the past.</p>
<p>“Please let me go. For the time being, I think I need time for myself, not Dmitry.”</p>
<p>He got up and said his goodbyes as he left.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Two people were left, and Baron Romero said,</p>
<p>“… well, I had put too much of a burden on Rodwell. Because you, the eldest son, were called a fool. Because of people who say that commoners have limitations by birth, I believed Rodwell might be the person best suited to be in charge of the family after observing him become dedicated to training and outperforming others.”</p>
<p>His chest felt stuffy. His second son had always been dignified. Perhaps because he trusted him too much, the last glance his son showed him stuck in his heart.</p>
<p>“At a young age, Rodwell lived a life where his father expected too much from him. He trusted me and followed every word I said. At first, the child, who was so young, did everything with a strong look in his eyes and without saying any complaint. Rodwell was the pride of Dmitry. And today, I told Rodwell, who has lived all his life for Dmitry, that he couldn’t be the successor. What a cruel thing it is. But I still don’t think that choice is wrong. For the future of Dmitry’s people, it is only right for you, Roman, to become the successor.”</p>
<p>But as a father, his mind felt burdened. As the head of the family, the decision he made was right, but from the moment Rodwell left, his face was stained with sadness.</p>
<p>‘I am not a good father.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a sore thumb, so he paid more attention to him. He took for granted every great thing that Rodwell did. However, when Roman Dmitry did something well, he was so happy because he was the child who shared his life as a commoner. Back then, he believed that it was right for a father to take care of a sad child.</p>
<p>Whereas, for Rodwell Dmitry, he thought that he should pass down the family to him as compensation.</p>
<p>After getting older and living his life, he ended up becoming a clumsy person, even as a parent. People admired Baron Romero as a political figure. However, he wasn’t a good father.</p>
<p>“Roman.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I am not a smart person. Even after doing something I would regret, I still don’t know what to do as a father. Normally, I would ask your mother about it. But now, there is something I wish to ask of you.”</p>
<p>“Say it.”</p>
<p>The father and son looked at each other. For Dmitry’s new future, rather than living a life that the people would look up to, he wanted Dmitry to be Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Take care of your sibling. He is a child who has lost a lot. I am not sure if asking this of you is good for Rodwell, but I don’t think it is bad for a family to do what it means to be a family. I am a father to both you and Rodwell. Just as you work hard even if your father is lacking, I hope you do so for our family too. This is my last request from you, who will inherit Dmitry.”</p>
<p>At the word ‘family,’ Roman Dmitry paused for a moment. He wasn’t used to his present life since it was so different from the previous one he had.</p>
<p>“I understand, Father.”</p>
<p>A plain answer.</p>
<p>At those words, Baron Romero finally showed a comfortable smile.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He soon left the office. Roman Dmitry walked down the hallway, looking down at his hands.</p>
<p>‘In my previous life, I used these hands to kill my own blood relatives.’</p>
<p>It was still vivid—the faces of those who tried to kill him and ended up being killed, and the curses he heard until their breathing stopped.</p>
<p>The siblings with whom he thought he had a good bond were the same. At the moment when he ended their lives, they blamed him when he put pressure on their throats and not their father, who instigated it. That was the life of Baek Joong-hyuk and his brothers.</p>
<p>However, his present life was different. When he met Lauren Dmitry and spoke to Rodwell Dmitry, Roman felt calm.</p>
<p>“Foolish bastard.”</p>
<p>It was pathetic. Rodwell looked like he had lost the world just because he lost an eye, and now he just gave up the position of the successor without another thought. It was something he couldn’t have imagined in his previous life.</p>
<p>Unlike his brothers, who were desperate to hold power, Rodwell didn’t want a dispute in their family.</p>
<p>The world was tough. He was his younger brother and someone born with the same blood as him, so he wasn’t going to let Rodwell Dmitry collapse like this.</p>
<p>What kind of person did he have as an older brother, and what did it mean to live as a Dmitry? He was thinking of showing it to him this time.</p>
<p>He took a step and arrived at Dmitry’s training room, where Rodwell was swinging his sword under the sun.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 199 - Dmitry Duchy (4)</p>
<p>In the middle of the training room, Rodwell Dmitry looked at his sword. Unlike before, one side of his vision was dark, and there was this unknown sense of unbalance in his body.</p>
<p>There was a momentary feeling of hate. At one time, the tool called a sword was so familiar, as if it were a part of his body, but now even his own body wasn’t following him.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>And then he ran forward. The muscles he had trained for years were screaming, and he swung his sword against the imaginary enemy.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>It was a short hair difference, and the attack missed. The information transmitted through his senses correctly judged the location of his opponent, but when he swung the sword, the opponent seemed a lot farther away.</p>
<p>There was now a gap in his senses. His brain used the senses based on his memories in the past, but the senses that conveyed the current information gave different information because of the loss of his one eye.</p>
<p>He stepped forward and continued to attack without stopping, but not a single attack was done correctly.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>It was the same now. Even though he was exchanging blows with his imaginary opponent and launching dangerous attacks, he wasn’t even able to scratch the opponent. Thus, he couldn’t produce a satisfactory scene.</p>
<p>His attacks were too shallow, and he was the one dying. When his imaginary opponent killed him, Rodwell gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>It was fine to die. Just once, he wanted to be able to use his senses properly. However, the moment that even the last attack that he tried so hard to do was unsuccessful, he felt his heart sink.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>He fell down badly. Blood flowed from his forehead, but Rodwell looked up at the sky with a dazed face.</p>
<p>The battle with Kronos—he didn’t regret risking his life there. If he could turn back time, he would have made the same decision for the sake of Cairo. However, the realities he had to accept were too difficult.</p>
<p>Even though he had lived for the future of Dmitry all his life, he had to acknowledge that he had to give up the position of successor. Because Roman Dmitry showed stronger results, Rodwell Dmitry lost the greatest goal of his life, and his unstable physical condition made his swordsmanship shaky.</p>
<p>Everything changed, so he himself gave up on being the successor. Even though it was the conclusion that he himself had thought of, the emotions he was feeling were too much.</p>
<p>He looked up at the sky. It was sunny. Contrary to his own thoughts, Rodwell looked at the calm sky and smiled. He was annoyed, but he wasn’t exactly blaming anyone. If he had been strong enough not to lose an eye, then he would have been a more suitable successor than Roman Dmitry. In the series of events, there was no reason for him to act strong.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He got up with his sword. He was a man of honor. He didn’t know what had caused his brother to change, but he had no intention of staying as the stain in the family.</p>
<p>So what if he wasn’t the successor? So what if he lost an eye? He would do it all over again. [TL/N: Fight in such a situation.] Gritting his teeth, Rodwell Dmitry began to swing his sword.</p>
<p>He was a mess. There was no longer the sharpness in his movements that he had before, so he tried to adapt to only having one eye. The sun was hot, making his sweat drip like rain.</p>
<p>“That will not solve the problem.”</p>
<p>Said a familiar voice.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was standing on one side.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Your body has been training on how to wield the sword in a normal state for a long time. Your loss of one eye doesn’t mean there is a restriction in your vision, but everything will start to change. It isn’t that your current method is wrong, but there is a way to be more certain of your growth.”</p>
<p>At the time of conquering Murim, many of his subordinates lost different body parts. They had gaps in their senses and numerous handicaps, so different ways to overcome them were created.</p>
<p>“Shut off your five senses and start from the initial point again. If you practice utilizing only one of your senses without recognizing that you’ve lost one, the gap won’t be an issue when you utilize all five senses later on. Of course, blocking all five of your senses is impossible to train. But if you want to, you can try it.”</p>
<p>It was honest advice. He said it in the best way, but Rodwell didn’t seem happy.</p>
<p>“And why should I listen to you, Brother?”</p>
<p>Blocking out a sense could be the answer. Even if it was a short-term solution, Rodwell Dmitry didn’t want to follow Roman’s advice. It was a matter of emotion.</p>
<p>While he did acknowledge Roman Dmitry’s growth and how he was the most suited heir, he still didn’t want to accept his help now. It was that kind of reaction.</p>
<p>Rodwell Dmitry looked away and focused on sword training again.</p>
<p>“The choice is yours. But they are facts you should know.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a conversation. It was a one-sided message. Even if the other person ignored his words, Roman Dmitry spoke honestly.</p>
<p>“Dmitry has now stepped into a new phase. There will be many hurdles from now on, and we do not know what tricks the Kronos Empire and Valhalla will do. In addition, we cannot trust the Kingdoms’ Alliance just yet as we are not allies. At this time, we need to defend ourselves. If we break down and let our emotions eat us, those who believe in us will be the ones paying the price.”</p>
<p>The scope of the fence was widening. As he accepted new relationships, Roman’s values also changed. If he would follow the laws of his previous life, he wouldn’t be pursuing such a direction.</p>
<p>“I need people I can trust for the future of Dmitry. Until now, I was able to handle everything on my own, but with time, I will have no choice but to face my limit. If Dmitry is attacked while I am away from a battle on the borders, and if the empire chooses to attack, I need people to replace me on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>His conquest of Murim wasn’t something he did on his own. In Baek Joong-hyuk’s absence, there were people who could replace him and were called the Four Kings. And so…</p>
<p>“Rodwell Dmitry. You are my younger brother and blood. If I need someone to lead Dmitry in my absence….”</p>
<p>It was a relationship based on trust. A need for mutual exchange should sometimes come from blind emotions on one side.</p>
<p>“I hope it will be you.”</p>
<p>Those were his last words, and Rodwell Dmitry’s eyes widened. His older brother from a long time ago, whom he thought no longer existed, was now in front of him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Time went by, and the day of the proclamation ceremony finally arrived. People flocked to the castle of Dmitry, and the ceremony for the declaration of Dmitry becoming a Duchy was held in front of everyone.</p>
<p>Daniel Cairo stepped forward.</p>
<p>“Today is a very meaningful day for Cairo and the Salamander continent. Recently, Cairo has experienced events that threatened the security of the nation. The traitorous Marquis Benedict brought the Kronos Empire to his aid, and the battles in the West terrified the people. Actually, the former Cairo would have chosen to compromise in that situation. Even in situations where we were not wrong, we always bowed our heads first, and at one time, I thought it was supposed to be that way. But then the Dmitry family proved that I was wrong. They awakened Cairo’s pride and showed how the nation should move forward for it to exist.”</p>
<p>His voice was gaining strength. The experience was slowly developing him, and now he could handle it.</p>
<p>He glanced at the people. From the Kingdoms’ Alliance and to the Hector Kingdom, and to those who attended the ceremony to celebrate Dmitry Duchy, he expressed his thoughts.</p>
<p>“Dmitry deserves a new start with everyone’s blessings. I, Daniel Cairo, as the King of the Cairo Kingdom, will sincerely congratulate our ally, Dmitry Duchy, and do my best to develop the community of both nations.”</p>
<p>And at that moment, cheers erupted. Dmitry’s people were cheering, and important figures from other nations knew what Daniel Cairo’s remarks meant.</p>
<p>They were friendly nations, and that meant one wasn’t below another. On an equal footing, he was standing with the Dmitry Duchy.</p>
<p>‘… Cairo has recognized the Dmitry Duchy as having its own individual force, and they are putting wings on the back of Dmitry even when people are going insane with Dmitry’s actions.’</p>
<p>It was someone’s idea.</p>
<p>And that was what Daniel Cairo intended.</p>
<p>When Baron Romero stepped onto the stage after the King was done, Dmitry was in a festive mood.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The festival continued. The Dmitry family prepared a separate seat for the nobles in the inner courtyard, and outside, food was prepared so that the common people could enjoy the party.</p>
<p>It was a scene that showed how rich Dmitry was. It would require a lot of money to feed thousands of mouths, but Duke Romero wasn’t stingy.</p>
<p>In Dmitry’s mines, since safety devices had been installed, the amount of wealth they were earning from them had completely exceeded the normal level. From the endless mountains, minerals that people never knew existed were excavated.</p>
<p>There were plenty of jobs, and as rumors circulated that Dmitry was completely safe, workers from outside Dmitry were also rushing over.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s development was just a natural result. With supply and demand in perfect harmony, Dmitry grew into a large city to the extent that treating the people lavishly wouldn’t make Dmitry lose money.</p>
<p>It was such a good time. As people ate and talked, representatives from other nations came to talk to Duke Romero.</p>
<p>“Duke Dmitry, Roman Dmitry is already in his 20s, so shouldn’t he be getting married sometime soon? A man can do great things only when his family is stable. Just in time, the princess of the Umberto Kingdom is also at the right age to get married, so how about setting up a time?”</p>
<p>The representative of the Umberto Kingdom, Count Verdi, asked.</p>
<p>When he directly spoke about marriage, Duke Romero showed a troubled expression.</p>
<p>“I also hope Roman finds a good match, but as you all know, Roman has his own flaws. Even though he was engaged to a woman, he didn’t go through with it in the end, so how can I talk about marriage to him again? Actually, I just hope that he never gets into danger. That is more important to me than his marriage.”</p>
<p>He avoided answering it. Usually, for nobles, the right age to find a partner was during their late teens. However, with Roman’s reputation as a fool, many people didn’t want him, and the one marriage he tried to have failed.</p>
<p>It was a matter that the Dmitry family thought about a lot, and Duke Romero considered that his marriage was not a priority anymore due to the incident with Lawrence.</p>
<p>Besides, breaking up was a huge problem. There was a high chance that the nobles who were sensitive to the issue wouldn’t take the risk of breaking up their marriage. However….</p>
<p>“A flaw? He is Dmitry’s Hero, having defeated Gustavo in his 20s. So who would consider one breakup as a flaw? The life of a hero is full of twists and turns. If people consider breaking an engagement as a flaw, then I will arrange a marriage with a wise woman who appreciates Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>“Right. He is now the heir to the Duchy, too, so breaking off the marriage isn’t a problem at all.”</p>
<p>They were the members of the Kingdoms’ Alliance, Viscount Ringo from the Redford Kingdom and Marquis Marten of the Odelia Kingdom. Representing each kingdom, they added their words to Count Verdi’s remarks.</p>
<p>At that moment, their eyes met. From the remarks that had just been made, everyone knew they had a common purpose here.</p>
<p>‘These guys are here for Roman Dmitry!’</p>
<p>‘Damn them!’</p>
<p>‘How dare they!’</p>
<p>As they looked into each other’s eyes, competition rose.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 200 - Dmitry Duchy (5)</p>
<p>The Kingdoms’ Alliance referred to the four kingdoms in the southwestern part of the Salamander continent, and since they faced borders with the Kronos and Valhalla Empires, they created an alliance to protect one another.</p>
<p>Just like Cairo, they had always been sensitive to imperial issues. The difference was that they were still well-organized internally, but people say they wouldn’t have cared to compromise without the imperial threats.</p>
<p>They were water and oil. They made the alliance to survive, and they instinctively recognized how important Roman Dmitry was.</p>
<p>A few days after the Dmitry Duchy was declared, the Umberto royal family held a meeting headed by Count Verdi,</p>
<p>“Your Majesty, the recent civil war in Cairo is an exceptional event that has never been seen in the Salamander continent’s history. In the past, there have been incidents of anger and revenge against the empire for its actions. However, not a single one of them wrapped up as cleanly as this. Roman Dmitry boldly opened the gates, went out, and killed Count Fabio and Knight Gustavo, drawing in our alliance to prepare for the wrath of the empire. This means that he is someone who knows how to use his brain and body.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s actions shocked the continent, and everyone held their breath, paying attention to everything Roman Dmitry was doing.</p>
<p>“The atrocities of the Kronos Empire keep getting worse, and even though our Kingdoms’ Alliance has been holding on until now, there is no guarantee that we can do that forever. Roman Dmitry. We need to make him a member of our nation. He is still unmarried. As long as we can secure Roman Dmitry by making him marry our princess, our future will be secured.”</p>
<p>“Count Verdi. Doesn’t the princess already have someone she likes?”</p>
<p>“This is not the right time to care about her personal feelings. The continent’s situation is changing so much. Considering how the power of the Duchy was shown in the war, I cannot imagine how much it would grow. Now is our chance. We need to obtain Roman Dmitry. Furthermore, we need to accept the Dmitry Duchy.”</p>
<p>His breakup was the only flaw. In the past, it could have been an issue, but not now. It was well-known that Roman Dmitry defeated Knight Gustavo in his mid-20s and was likely to be the successor of the Duchy. In addition, even the Phoenix Magic Tower became a member of Dmitry. They were also rich and had iron mines, which made them the perfect ally with lots of resources. And so their mouths watered.</p>
<p>At Count Verdi’s strong insistence, the King said,</p>
<p>“I understand. I will entrust to you the full authority for this matter, so make sure Roman Dmitry accepts this marriage.”</p>
<p>“I shall follow your order.”</p>
<p>However, the other kingdoms were not any different. Except for the Frank Kingdom, the Redford Kingdom and the Odelia Kingdom were also saying the same thing.</p>
<p>And so now that the nations had figured out the intentions that the others had, they instinctively knew that a war had begun.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Again, the first one was Count Verdi. As if the representatives of the other kingdoms weren’t paying any attention, he turned to Duke Dmitry and spoke,</p>
<p>“This is true. I tried to refrain from bragging, but I have something to say. Duke, Princess Umberto is the most beautiful person in Umberto, and she has both beauty and wisdom to the extent that she graduated with excellent grades from a prestigious academy. Actually, many of the kingdoms wanted her hand, but His Majesty refused all of them, saying he cannot hand over his daughter.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lie. Actually, Princess Umberto received offers from many men and was someone who was wanted by everyone, but she said she would choose whom she would marry.</p>
<p>“But even His Majesty said that if it is Roman Dmitry, then he would accept him with open arms. Aren’t they a good pair? The marriage of Umberto’s beauty and the best man in Dmitry, I am sure this is the best decision for the future of both nations.”</p>
<p>Right after praising the princess, he raised the level of Roman Dmitry too. With a speech that melted the heart of the other person, Count Verdi was sure it would work.</p>
<p>However….</p>
<p>“Count Verdi. I have heard about the reputation the princess holds, but isn’t there someone she likes? Rumors say that she often meets a man from a Baron’s family. Is her relationship with him over?”</p>
<p>It was Viscount Ringo. When he mentioned the part that was kept a secret, Count Verdi lost it.</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that? The rumors you say have nothing to do with the truth.”</p>
<p>“Ah, but that is an open fact, so why deny it? Duke Dmitry. A person who has a partner they like will be happy with them. Just tell me what kind of woman you want. As soon as I return to the kingdom, I will bring you the list of daughters from noble families who fit the description. You do not have to worry about any issues related to divorce. No one will ever have an issue with it.”</p>
<p>“Viscount Ringo!”</p>
<p>The atmosphere had turned grim. When Count Verdi’s eyes turned red, Marquis Marten took over.</p>
<p>“Everyone, please hold yourselves back. Dmitry’s marriage is not a matter for us to discuss. It is for the future of the Dmitry Duchy, so it has to be done after a careful decision. We, Odelia, are the only nation that can match them. Think about it. Right now, Umberto and Redford aren’t in the best situations, so aren’t you being greedy by wanting someone like Dmitry?”</p>
<p>“YOU!”</p>
<p>The line was crossed. Viscount Ringo was holding back until then, but now it felt like he would burst.</p>
<p>“What kind of nonsense are you saying in such a nice atmosphere?! Marquis Marten. I thought you were a nice person, but you turned out to be rude. Apologize right now!”</p>
<p>“Apologize for what? The Duke said nothing about it, and yet you kept pushing the idea of marriage! Who is being rude?”</p>
<p>It was a mess. According to the rumors, they were only together because they wanted to live, but they didn’t actually get along.</p>
<p>The atmosphere intensified, and Duke Romero said,</p>
<p>“Everyone, please stop.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>Silence fell. Everyone should have made themselves look good to the Duke, but here they were, threatening one another.</p>
<p>“Roman’s marriage is not my decision to make. I am not interested in tying him down in an arranged marriage. If Roman ties himself to a woman, it will be someone he has met and fallen in love with, and not for the sake of the nation. So you do not have to do this. Rather, try convincing Roman. If there is a woman who wins his heart, I will welcome her with open arms.”</p>
<p>At that point, they all looked at each other. It seemed like they just wasted their time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the mess was going on, Baron Larsson, the representative of the Frank Kingdom, had more issues than marriage to talk about with Roman.</p>
<p>“Mr. Felix.”</p>
<p>“… Baron Larsson.”</p>
<p>On the other side of the party, Felix, who was talking with two to three people, found Baron Larsson. The two were familiar with each other. To be precise, the man played a huge role in bringing Phoenix to Frank.</p>
<p>“Are you here as the representative of Frank?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It isn’t much, but can we talk about it separately?”</p>
<p>“… okay. Come here.”</p>
<p>And then they walked. They headed to the terrace, where people were scarce, and Baron Larsson got straight to the point.</p>
<p>“His Majesty of Frank was shocked to know that the Phoenix Magic Tower had suddenly left. I will not ask why you moved here, but can’t you come back to Frank? We are fully reflecting on the things we downplayed, and we will not spare any effort in funding and helping the Magic Tower. I promise it in my name.”</p>
<p>The civil war in Cairo—in the process of making Roman Dmitry famous, it brought attention to the people with him. It was Phoenix.</p>
<p>Regarded as the lowest among the Magic Towers existing on the continent, they demonstrated their ability to use the Burning spell, which was supposedly lost.</p>
<p>The image of Felix taking down Benedict Castle was talked about everywhere. And the Frank Kingdom was furious to hear such rumors. They thought Phoenix was no longer useful. A Magic Tower was something that needed constant money, but with their technique lost, they stopped funding Phoenix.</p>
<p>Then what was this? Things had changed. As they were subtly cutting down their support, the Phoenix magicians suddenly emptied the Magic Tower and disappeared, and then they appeared again while demonstrating their use of Burning.</p>
<p>They were confused. Thinking that Phoenix was theirs, the Frank Kingdom sent their representative right away. And the expression on Baron Larsson’s face said it. Even as he spoke, he was feeling shame for relaying this.</p>
<p>Felix’s expression hardened.</p>
<p>“You know it well. The Frank Kingdom broke their promise to Phoenix.”</p>
<p>“This time, it will be different. I will be in charge…”</p>
<p>“No. I don’t think anything will work. Do you know what the first thought that came to my mind after moving to Dmitry was? Trust—I learned it for the first time. Dmitry didn’t just want us to act out our duties. They respected us and made sure they did what they promised.”</p>
<p>After the war ended, Phoenix received so many calls. Everyone said they wanted Phoenix to move into their estate, but their answer was the same.</p>
<p>“We swore allegiance to Roman Dmitry. We aren’t staying here because of some conditions. We found someone who recognized our strength and worth, and we are not looking for other places until he no longer needs us. So please head back and tell His Majesty that our relationship with Frank is now over.”</p>
<p>Then he stepped back.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Baron Larsson couldn’t bear it. Even though Frank had the advantage, they made the mistake of letting Dmitry, a noble family, steal them.</p>
<p>He had a headache. Returning to the kingdom, he was worried about how to report it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The same bed, yet different dreams. In the party hall, people moved for their own purposes. Roman Dmitry looked down from above.</p>
<p>‘The two empires didn’t send their representatives. Kronos already spoke about their intention to assassinate me, and Valhalla will not come as stepping here would mean that they have accepted Count Denver’s death.’</p>
<p>The empires’ positions were clear. People called Kronos the evil empire on the continent, but Valhalla couldn’t be seen as such a good empire either. How did Valhalla even reach the level of an empire? Naturally, they also trampled on other kingdoms and families just like how Kronos rose.</p>
<p>They were the same. Just as Kronos foretold the assassination, Valhalla would also think that it was necessary to take revenge for Count Denver’s death. And the people of the empire would follow them and take revenge. In order for an empire to be an empire, all problems had to be cleared.</p>
<p>“The situation on the continent is constantly changing. The Kronos Empire has just now revealed its ambition of conquering the continent, and everyone knows that Valhalla has the same ambition. Just as the representatives have gathered here, it will be a fight between the Kingdoms’ Alliance and the Empires.”</p>
<p>The Kingdoms’ Alliance was formed by the weak forces joining together. Frank, Umberto, Redford, and Odelia, and then Cairo and Hector.</p>
<p>Roman had no intention of blindly trusting the alliance of the weak. Being united because they were weak meant that someone could betray them and join the strong the moment the balance of power collapsed.</p>
<p>‘This alliance is temporary. In the end, I have to be able to stand up against the empire on my own.’</p>
<p>He felt thirsty. The moment he took a sip of his wine, Hans approached him and said,</p>
<p>“Young Master, a guest is waiting in the reception room.”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t informed that I would be meeting a guest. Who is there?”</p>
<p>The guest who was waiting was….</p>
<p>“The Prince of the Hector Kingdom.”</p>
<p>A few days ago, Edwin Hector, who shocked Knight Jonathan, who was guarding the castle’s gate, was the unexpected person looking for Roman.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 201 - Wheel Of Fate (1)</p>
<p>Dmitry’s reception room.</p>
<p>As he entered, there was a familiar face. Edwin Hector was drinking tea and greeted Roman Dmitry like it was a natural meeting.</p>
<p>“Long time no see.”</p>
<p>“Why did you want to see me?”</p>
<p>“You seem to be in a hurry. Please sit down.”</p>
<p>This was unexpected. The last memories of both men weren’t good. Seeing the walls collapse and Hector’s soldiers slaughtered, Edwin Hector showed eyes full of hate as if he were about to shed bloody tears.</p>
<p>The relationship between the two was clearly bad. No matter how much they should disregard their personal feelings for national interest, their relationship couldn’t be this peaceful.</p>
<p>Roman sat down.</p>
<p>Edwin Hector lightly tossed the topic to ease the tension.</p>
<p>“First of all, congratulations on the foundation of the Dmitry Duchy. I knew that Roman Dmitry was a great man, but I didn’t think that you would end the civil war in Cairo and also defeat Kronos. Even in Hector, many people were surprised by your actions. Everyone was outraged by the atrocities of the empire, but no one could act as you did.”</p>
<p>“Get straight to the point. We aren’t close enough to compliment one another without feeling awkward.”</p>
<p>“… you are right. In fact, I also didn’t expect for us to meet in another place other than the battlefield.”</p>
<p>The atmosphere turned cold. The events in the past—Edwin Hector didn’t forget them. He was now being forced to smile because of the situation, but on the battlefield, Roman Dmitry made him feel an overwhelming sense of terror.</p>
<p>During the time when he crossed the border for his nation, Hector’s soldiers were one-sidedly annihilated, and the defeated soldiers, who did not gain anything, had no choice but to spend a really cold and difficult winter.</p>
<p>And Butler, who suffered major injuries, needed a full year to even hold the sword again. His heart ached for him.</p>
<p>Hearing the news of Butler’s despair and what he was going through made Hector frustrated. Edwin Hector, who lived away at the time, fell into guilt over the wrong choice he had made.</p>
<p>Hector was in decline. If he hadn’t pushed for the war, he wouldn’t have experienced that pain of defeat, and even though it was difficult right now, the people who died would still be alive.</p>
<p>He caught his breath. The past was bad luck. And having encountered Roman Dmitry on the battlefield, he was even more certain that he had to meet the guy.</p>
<p>Edwin Hector said,</p>
<p>“I’m going to tell you the truth about the war between Cairo and Hector. There was another side, a shady side, which instigated the war.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s expression didn’t change. As he calmly accepted the news, Edwin Hector spoke what he had prepared in his head.</p>
<p>“As Mr. Roman Dmitry knows, the Hector Kingdom decided to go to war because of the poor harvest that year. I am not making excuses for what happened. We attacked Cairo to live, and that was wrong. But right after the war ended, we confirmed that the poor harvest had been done by force.”</p>
<p>The timing felt odd. The village, which was initially normal, soon showed signs of an anomaly when the war was over like there was no more need to hide.</p>
<p>“It started with a village in Hector. It was a village that had a bad harvest, and as soon as the war ended, the ground turned dry and black, and there were reports that too many carcasses of animals were found close by. And that was just the start. With the abnormal symptoms spreading throughout Hector, we learned that there was another reason for the poor harvest that was afflicting Hector—the Necromancer’s Curse. The beings who worked hard to dry the land for a long time didn’t care about hiding what they did once they achieved their goal.”</p>
<p>It takes a lot of effort to keep a curse running, so the situation was clear. Hector thought that God had abandoned them, and that was why they weren’t getting any food, but the reason was something else.</p>
<p>When his doubts became certain, Edwin Hector couldn’t contain the rage inside of him. In the war with Cairo, the people who died and the people who went to the battlefield to obtain food for their nation met a monster called Roman Dmitry and achieved nothing.</p>
<p>He wasn’t going to blame it on the other person. The idiocy of being duped by a dark and shady plan, as well as their defeat in the war, occurred because the officials who governed Hector were lacking.</p>
<p>However, he had to find out the truth. Having entered the Magic Tower through a deal with the tower master, he had an intense time last year.</p>
<p>“Which side really benefited the most from the war between Cairo and Hector? If you think about it, you can assert that the force was the Kronos Empire. Those who want to use Cairo as a bridge to begin their conquest will only benefit from whoever wins between Cairo and Hector, so I began to concentrate on them. At first, I didn’t believe it. Even though their ambitions have reached their peak, black magic is an area that humanity shouldn’t touch.”</p>
<p>It had been exactly one year, and he had just recently discovered a fact that drew Edwin to Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Ten years ago, I discovered that there was a phenomenon similar to Hector in the Kronos Empire. There was a deliberately bad crop, but the Kronos Empire didn’t actively solve the problem and hid the truth instead. So when we found a clue about a person related to it, we discovered that their poor harvest was the result of an experiment.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t perfect evidence. The person who knew about the bad harvest was just an errand boy, and he had no power, so they couldn’t use that as evidence.</p>
<p>However, Edwin Hector convinced him. As he looked at Roman Dmitry, he revealed his purpose for visiting Dmitry.</p>
<p>“It was as expected. The true identity of that shadow was the Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The benefits that could be gained from the war between the two kingdoms were obvious. Control barbarians with barbarians. Even if the Kronos Empire didn’t exert much effort, they could drive Cairo into a corner by attracting external forces.</p>
<p>In fact, the war on the Southern Front was directly linked to Kronos’s gains. The Hector Kingdom tried to bring in the Kronos Empire to solve the unfavorable situation, and regardless of the result, the Cairo Kingdom had no choice but to focus on the Southern Front rather than the Western Front for a while.</p>
<p>So they were slowly taking Cairo’s breath. Just as Hector withered away from a bad harvest, the internal and external strife weakened Cairo.</p>
<p>Edwin Hector said,</p>
<p>“People only focus on the bad things that Kronos is doing in front of their eyes. Since they openly declared taking over the continent, we only think it would be fortunate enough if they didn’t invade the borders. But the truth is different. The Kronos Empire is cleverly destroying those who stand in their way one by one. Their target is Cairo. They are using Cairo to step into a bigger war, as they can defeat it easily. Unlike the Kingdoms’ Alliance, which consists of four kingdoms. Cairo and Hector—if they destroy the two kingdoms and take full control of the northern part of the continent, then they can split the continent and do a full conquest.”</p>
<p>“If that is true, why come to me without releasing this to the public? Since black magic is a sensitive subject, even the Kronos Empire wouldn’t be able to avoid taking responsibility.”</p>
<p>“I agree. But that alone won’t bring the empire down. No, maybe it will even start the war. The Kronos Empire has been holding back its ambitions because of Valhalla, but in fact, it wouldn’t be strange if a war broke out. And with the current strength of the Kingdoms’ Alliance, excluding the empire, there is no one else who can handle it.”</p>
<p>It was enough evidence. Kronos knew full well that the kingdoms could do nothing but argue, and that an argument not backed by force was meaningless. So Edwin Hector first thought of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Our relationship went wrong from the start. The responsibility lies with Hector, and if you ask us to take responsibility for it, I will gladly accept it. However, in order to stop the ambitions of Kronos, Dmitry and Hector must work together.”</p>
<p>His true purpose was an alliance. He hoped for the power of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“For years, Hector’s people starved to death. Whenever I think of their faces in sadness caused by the Kronos Empire, I feel that I cannot live with them under the same sky. My heart is angry, and I am angry to the point of going insane. This is not just Hector’s problem, so please join me in my plan to destroy the Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p>It was a rather one-sided conversation. Edwin Hector coughed up his accumulated resentment, and his words were quite persuasive too.</p>
<p>However, strangely, despite saying all that, Roman Dmitry had a calm face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a strange atmosphere. Roman Dmitry took a sip of his tea, put the cup down, and looked at Edwin Hector.</p>
<p>“I knew.”</p>
<p>“… what do you know?”</p>
<p>“After the battle on the Southern Front, I asked my people to travel around the continent. Actually, the war between Hector and Cairo was something both sides didn’t want, and I thought maybe it was instigated by someone. As you said, it was very clear that the two nations would shed blood, and someone would benefit from it.”</p>
<p>The Lower District. The people of the information guild were all over the continent. They gathered all the information and got a clue about black magic by putting all that information together.</p>
<p>Hector’s bad harvest smelled odd to him. As Edwin investigated, he couldn’t find clear evidence that it was the work of the Kronos Empire, but at least it was possible for him to infer that it was the plan of someone.</p>
<p>Actually, it wasn’t that surprising. Edwin Hector seemed to be expressing his anger at the part about how humans used black magic, but there were many cases in Murim that were worse.</p>
<p>The Gangshis that were made from corpses. They were monsters that sucked out people’s qi. Many people gave up living as human beings in order to achieve their own goals.</p>
<p>And Roman said,</p>
<p>“We are already preparing for war with Kronos. If it was really them, they would surely put their ambition of conquering the continent into action, and just like the Hector Kingdom, they would stop at nothing to destroy Dmitry. But aside from that, why should Dmitry join the Hector Kingdom?”</p>
<p>“… does that mean you will decline my offer?”</p>
<p>“Let’s be straightforward. Precisely, I am asking if Hector is in a position to make such an offer.”</p>
<p>His eyes changed. They looked the same as when he was on the battlefield. Roman Dmitry showed ferocious eyes, as if he were going to devour Edwin Hector.</p>
<p>“The Hector Kingdom was cornered by the intentions of Kronos, and even though you attacked Cairo as a surprise, you failed to achieve your purpose. It shows that you are weak. Due to the long, poor harvest you had, Hector festers from the inside, and those who are troubled by this incident will inevitably lose their intention of being soldiers as time goes by. And that isn’t all.”</p>
<p>It was the cruel truth. Roman Dmitry mercilessly revealed what he had tried to ignore.</p>
<p>“The war with Cairo is over, and the bad harvest is over. But it will take time to restore those lost lands, and the people of the Hector Kingdom are still hungry since it hasn’t been fully resolved yet. I heard that Prince Edwin Hector got a lot of help from the Magic Tower. But the problem still hasn’t been resolved yet? If war breaks out, does Hector even have the supplies to carry out the war? Prince. It isn’t like I don’t know your sincerity. Your mind thinks of your people. Your desire for revenge is on the verge of exploding, and you want to take Kronos down. However…”</p>
<p>This meeting and this conversation, which was supposed to be smooth, went wrong from the start, just like the relationship between the two men.</p>
<p>“Stop saying things I already know, and tell me why I should join hands with you.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 202 - Wheel Of Fate (2)</p>
<p>Edwin Hector was shocked. If others were told of the conspiracy of the Kronos Empire, they wouldn’t reject his offer. The enemy of all. It was a plan to overthrow the Kronos Empire, so why was he reacting so aggressively?</p>
<p>“To be honest, I don’t understand what Mr. Roman Dmitry means. The Dmitry Duchy invited the Kingdoms’ Alliance and told them about the coming future. Just as you drew in the Kingdoms’ Alliance during the incident with the Kronos Empire, it proves that the nations’ power must be maximized to counter the empire.”</p>
<p>Dmitry’s and Hector’s purposes coincided. Then it was only right for them to welcome Edwin’s hand.</p>
<p>“I will not deny that Hector is weak. In just one year, the damage caused by the harvest and the war couldn’t be solved, and there were people starving in Hector. But what does that have to do with this? If there is even one person willing to help overthrow Kronos, then this would help Dmitry too. It means that we will go to war together and bear the consequences together. And Hector’s plan is to involve Dmitry in this as well as the Kingdoms’ Alliance.”</p>
<p>Outside the office, a friendly conversation was happening at the party. As they clinked their glasses and talked about the future of the kingdom, they laughed and joined forces against a common enemy.</p>
<p>It was already agreed upon. On the surface, Dmitry and Hector’s positions were established, and Hector was just preparing to make sure of it. So the rejection wasn’t expected.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was unpredictable on the battlefield, but he didn’t expect the man to be this troublesome outside the battlefield too.</p>
<p>And Roman said,</p>
<p>“You are right. With the common enemy called the empire, the kingdoms can only survive if the alliance properly works together. What that means is a closer relationship. Then, does Prince Edwin Hector believe in the unity of the kingdoms? We may turn to each other for comfort now, but there is no guarantee that the situation will last.”</p>
<p>There was no such thing as permanent allies. Given that premise, Roman wanted to clarify the benefits they could reap from a solid relationship.</p>
<p>“Currently, if I were the Kronos Empire, I would think about destroying the Kingdoms’ Alliance, which is like a sandcastle.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Human relationships are complex. If one’s subordinate was loyal and could be trusted, the existence of those outside the wall had to be doubted.</p>
<p>Alliance and union—in order for such words to actually work, not only the purpose but also the conviction that the relationship is mutually beneficial must be present.</p>
<p>Hector had a clear purpose and they weren’t influenced by the trend.</p>
<p>“Recently, the situation in Umberto hasn’t been good. They border Kronos at the very front. They are suffering the most damage due to frequent battles. In addition, dissatisfaction is clear within their nation as a result of their exhaustion. If I were Kronos, I would try to make Umberto compromise. If they do, then the other nations will fall from the constant rift they will have with the other kingdoms.”</p>
<p>One possibility.</p>
<p>“The King of Redford has fallen into gambling. The security of the nation was put aside, and the treasury was used for his desires. The servants under him tried to solve it, but they eventually got their hands on the Golden Bank. As you know, the Golden Bank has influence all over the continent. If they start to press them to pay their debt, the kingdom will try to find ways to do that, which could be treason too.”</p>
<p>Maybe both.</p>
<p>“You think Frank and Odelia can be trusted? No, never. They have a very divided system of power, just like the old Cairo. Frank neglected supporting Phoenix, and a disaster happened because the forces of the empire who were there encouraged the King. Cairo found stability by taking down Marquis Benedict and the nobles, but miracles like that cannot happen everywhere.”</p>
<p>Finally,</p>
<p>“Then what about Hector? The four Kings in the alliance have weaknesses, making them targets for Kronos to attack. It is the same with Hector. If the starvation becomes extreme or if Valhalla declares war, are you sure you can handle that? I am asking if you, who want to take revenge against Kronos, have the strength not to be shaken.”</p>
<p>The Kingdoms’ Alliance was a sandcastle. They formed a hazy relationship that could collapse at any time.</p>
<p>“Dmitry has no intention of making the mistake of breaking ties with the alliance first. I hope to continue a friendly relationship with Hector as well. However, joining the plan you have come up with is another matter. The cost of excessive trust is fatal. If the allied nations betray each other, Dmitry will not be shaken. However, if we start to trust you and you betray us, that is a different thing. Because Hector is getting something out of this, and we cannot allow ourselves to be hit with a fatal attack.”</p>
<p>It was a complex matter. An alliance without trust—that was the answer he gave to Edwin Hector, who spoke honestly.</p>
<p>Looking at Edwin Hector, who couldn’t accept this situation, Roman Dmitry said in a low voice,</p>
<p>“It isn’t like I am not aware of the sincerity of the Hector Kingdom. Unlike the other kingdoms, you have a clear purpose to take revenge on Kronos and enough reason to be taken as an ally. The question is, is Hector truly worthy of Dmitry? That is an important role for Hector to play. If Hector says that you will take revenge on Kronos only with your mouth because of the harsh lives you have, Dmitry has no reason to treat Hector seriously. After all, what we can obtain from Hector isn’t much. Rather than that, trusting and following ourselves is a much smarter way to avoid taking risks.”</p>
<p>For his future plans, he needed confidence in Hector. And if they proved their worth, Roman would surely think about it. In addition, above all else, Roman wanted Dmitry to be the one who would handle the plan.</p>
<p>“I will ask you again. Do you have any reasons for Dmitry to truly join hands with Hector?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s words were right. Hector was weak. Even so, Edwin Hector talked about the plan first without knowing his place.</p>
<p>‘… if I think about it, the fact that the Kronos Empire is behind the shady plot isn’t that important.’</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire always looked friendly on the outside but was plotting something from behind. The continental war was always talked about.</p>
<p>Drying out the land of Hector was something he was angry about, but considering the things they did to overthrow the power Hector had, Edwin knew this was Kronos’s way.</p>
<p>And the truth just convinced him that reality hadn’t changed. Even though the Hector Kingdom lacked the power to carry out the plan, they only talked about destroying the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>“You are so cruel.”</p>
<p>Hector smiled. The truth was so cruel and harsh. Edwin Hector smiled self-deprecatingly.</p>
<p>“Actually, I know the truth. Hector is falling into the path of downfall, and at the pace that it is going, even if someone doesn’t attack it, it will collapse on its own. That is why I am desperate for revenge. Even though Hector only has a little bit of power left, we still have the desire to take revenge on Kronos for turning Hector into this state and to solve the problem of the kingdom with the little wealth we have left.”</p>
<p>Hector’s worth wasn’t clear. Even if they had the power to shine for the last time, it wouldn’t be too bright.</p>
<p>“Hector isn’t qualified to lead a war. If a war breaks out and the alliance wins, Hector will be there, but you cannot say that the victory was because of Hector’s strength. But that doesn’t mean that I will give up on the idea of revenge. From the moment the people of Hector collapsed and died from hunger, Hector became an existence that couldn’t coexist with Kronos.”</p>
<p>His voice became more and more strained. Looking at Roman, he added,</p>
<p>“You asked me on what grounds I came to Dmitry? I can just promise you one thing. As the Prince of the Hector Kingdom, if it is to destroy the Kronos Empire, I will risk my life and do my best. It is okay if we aren’t the ones leading the war. If you destroy Kronos and promise Hector’s future, then we will stand at the forefront of this war like a scapegoat and pave the way.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He was convinced by the conversation he had with him. If he was this meticulous, there was no other person more perfect than this man to lead this plan. And he truly believed that, so he made a sacrifice.</p>
<p>“Even if the Hector Kingdom gets reduced to nothing, we will still work to benefit Dmitry. How about doing this, then? Dmitry helps Hector. I don’t want much. If the soldiers are given good weapons, we will continue to move against Kronos. We only have one cause, so please help us. Rather than an alliance that is only shiny on the outside, I think Hector, who has a clear goal, is a better fit for Dmitry.”</p>
<p>It was a bold proposal. When he was asked about the return, he hoped that the expected result would be achieved.</p>
<p>Edwin’s eyes were stained with madness. As he uncovered the truth about the dying lands, he accepted his destiny as the Prince. So he chose to risk his life. If he couldn’t destroy Kronos, Hector would be finished anyway.</p>
<p>It was at that moment….</p>
<p>“The promise you just made. Keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>They weren’t a perfect ally. However, Hector was. He confirmed the value of Hector by accepting Edwin Hector.</p>
<p>“Dmitry will do our best to help Hector get back its power in the future from the shady ones.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Followed by Cairo, a second alliance was made. Rather than a showy Kingdoms’ Alliance, Hector had definite plans. Of course, variables always had to be prepared, but the meaning behind Hector’s movement didn’t change.</p>
<p>Before leaving, Edwin Hector said,</p>
<p>“When I first met Mr. Roman Dmitry on the battlefield, for the first time in my life, I felt I couldn’t handle someone. At that time, we were defeated in the war, and I thought about it a lot over the past year. Why did the perfect plan fail? Was it alright to accept failure just because of one person? People say that I met the wrong person. However, since I cannot say the same thing while dealing with Kronos, I do not want to avoid responsibility with that excuse.”</p>
<p>The Prince of a nation—the life of Edwin Hector, whom people looked up to, was in a tough time.</p>
<p>“I worked hard to become the person who can be a variable in any situation. It is no different now, too. Hector will be stronger than ever. In order to not be swayed by excuses, I will somehow raise the value of the Hector Kingdom, so Roman Dmitry, please set the stage for us.”</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. That was the last appearance of Edwin Hector as he left the room.</p>
<p>‘The Hector Kingdom. Edwin Hector alone is enough to bring the plans into motion.’</p>
<p>Beyond his figure, he saw into his intention. Edwin Hector didn’t waste the past year and became stronger. The mana inside of him showed that.</p>
<p>As his understanding of magic increased, Roman knew how great Edwin was. His growth was shocking. In the war against Kronos, Edwin Hector was a person who would play a nice role.</p>
<p>It was interesting. From an enemy to an ally. The wheel of fate connected the two of them again.</p>
<p>And at that time, another relationship entered Roman Dmitry’s wheel of fate.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 203 - Wheel Of Fate (3)</p>
<p>A week ago, while in Cairos, Flora Lawrence spent a lot of time with the tactics professor who once taught her.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>The pawn took a step forward. Flora Lawrence, who attempted to press down the opponent, spoke without taking her eyes off the board.</p>
<p>“Immediately after the battle in Cairos, Roman Dmitry headed to Benedict Castle with the pretext of taking down the rebels. As a result, the rebels were controlled, but actually, there were so many risky factors in that move. First, it was bold and dangerous to call Marquis Benedict’s faction rebels and arrest the other nobles from the empires’ factions. It surely had a temporary effect of suppressing the empires from intervening, but if the battle with Benedict extended longer, the empires would have intervened in the civil war.”</p>
<p>It was kind of a revival for them. The storm had passed, and now she was slowly reviewing the situation. Rather than looking at the results and being convinced that the method was right, she was analyzing the process, which brought the results once again.</p>
<p>The professor stopped the pawn from moving. Meanwhile, his gaze through his glasses wasn’t looking away from the board.</p>
<p>“There is a point in what you said. Just three days. Even if that amount of time had been dragged on by a little, the civil war in Cairo would have shown a different color than it has now. However, Roman Dmitry’s judgment was bold and reasonable. He secured the weapon called the ‘Phoenix Magic Tower,’ which the rebels didn’t expect him to have, and drove them into the castle that they thought was unbreakable. His intentions were clear. He knew that if they were given the time and options, the civil war would have lasted longer, so he deliberately forced them to choose an option that they thought had the upper hand.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He countered with a Knight. Raising his glasses, he looked at Flora.</p>
<p>“There is a difference between recklessness and boldness. The fact that the Kronos Empire didn’t waver and the fact that Roman Dmitry didn’t care about Kronos says that he was confident in the plan. And that made a difference in the success of the plan. Hence, Benedict’s rebel troops collapsed a lot faster despite the strength they held.”</p>
<p>“Then what do you think of his decision to open the gates? Although it was at a stage where Cairo wouldn’t suffer, the cost of failure was fatal. And the rebels had been sorted out, which produced a favorable outlook. Was it necessary to endanger the Western Front?”</p>
<p>“I agree that his choice was risky. If the battle outside the gate were lost, then the victory inside would have been worthless.”</p>
<p>The horses moved. While they exchanged attacks on the board, they analyzed tactics in their heads.</p>
<p>“But again, Roman Dmitry’s judgment was driven by a reason—the confidence that he could handle Gustavo. In addition, Kronos’s power was in a situation where it was easy to handle them with the Kingdoms’ Alliance, so if we could secure the advantage in strength, the variable was not as big as when the rebels were subdued.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>The words of her professor weighed on Flora Lawrence. It looked like a disadvantage at first, but it soon took the form of preying on the opponent.</p>
<p>“Flora. Roman Dmitry’s bold judgment shone in this war from beginning to end. It is definitely an area of ​​experience that cannot be acquired through books, but Roman Dmitry skillfully led everyone to the war as he intended. In conclusion, everything seems to be a trick, but in reality, it was a dangerous decision that could have fallen us into the abyss with the smallest mistake. Apart from the perfection of tactics, the war can also be said to have been created by Roman Dmitry’s personal capabilities.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>The Queen moved forward and drove the opponent to the corner.</p>
<p>“Checkmate.”</p>
<p>Surrounded by her enemy’s men, Flora Lawrence admitted defeat by putting her King down.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Left alone, Flora checked the chessboard. Even though the odds with her professor were even, she couldn’t focus on playing because she was busy analyzing Roman Dmitry’s tactics.</p>
<p>“…an area of ​​experience that cannot be acquired through books.”</p>
<p>She couldn’t readily accept her professor’s words. Flora Lawrence was not ignorant of Roman Dmitry’s life. Since he was once a person she was pushed to get married to, she asked around and found out what kind of person he was. There was no basis for the experience that her professor talked about. Roman Dmitry obviously lived a life far from the battlefield and suddenly changed into a new person.</p>
<p>Then…</p>
<p>“Is it the realm of talent?”</p>
<p>There was no other way to explain it. Roman Dmitry’s actions from the battle with Barco to the Southern Front and then the Northeast—Flora Lawrence used the issues in Cairo for her study, and it gave her goosebumps.</p>
<p>At first, she admired Roman Dmitry and his actions. However, the more she analyzed it, the more she noticed how absurd his accomplishments were. In particular, his actions on the Southern Front that brought a perfect end. He discerned Edwin Hector’s intention to occupy the Warp Gate, and the actions that he had taken at the moment played a decisive role in the Cairo Kingdom regaining the Southern Front.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Flora Lawrence studied really hard. She studied the tactics of the great men known in history and discovered that Roman Dmitry wasn’t a match for them.</p>
<p>‘How can Roman Dmitry always make the right decision, even with his life on the line? After the war, I realized he was right, but during the situation, even I would have never made that decision.’</p>
<p>She was also at the crossroads of choice. When Daniel Cairo decided to make them stay on the Western Front with the promise of a promotion, working with Roman Dmitry threw her into great confusion.</p>
<p>If she thought about it, why did she even head to the Western Front? It wasn’t just about taking risks. However, in Cairo, she was convinced that it was the most suitable place for development.</p>
<p>But will it still be the same now? No. The more she thought about it, the more she looked back on the past. It showed her what the right choice was.</p>
<p>‘I need to exclude human relationships and choose the best option for my own development.’</p>
<p>Then, there was no longer any need to worry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A week after that, on the day of the party, Flora Lawrence met her father in an area where there were fewer people.</p>
<p>“Flora. You can come back now.”</p>
<p>Viscount Lawrence said. With a slightly red face from drinking, he spoke with the emotions he had suppressed until now.</p>
<p>“At first, I wanted to support you with what you wanted. It was a wrong decision for a father to make you shoulder the burden of our family, so I sincerely supported you without knowing what you wanted to do. However, do you know how anxious I get when Kronos invades the borders each time? If something happens to you, I will never be able to have a peaceful night.”</p>
<p>The Western Front—people called it the death line. It is a place that others try to avoid at all costs, but Flora Lawrence willingly went there.</p>
<p>His heart ached. It wasn’t easy to survive on the battlefield with the body of a woman, and whenever he thought of Flora suffering there, his eyes would become watery. So he tried to build friendly relationships with Dmitry. He knew if something happened, Lawrence could not solve the problem alone.</p>
<p>He looked at Flora. And as a father, he couldn’t watch her do that anymore.</p>
<p>“I won’t stop you from doing what you want to do. I won’t force you into a marriage and to live like other women in noble families either, but stay at a distance where your father can come running to you on time.”</p>
<p>He spoke the truth.</p>
<p>Flora knew her father’s heart. However, she couldn’t do that again.</p>
<p>“Father, I experienced a lot on the Western Front. When I was living in Lawrence, it felt like the entire Northeast was my world, but that wasn’t true. No, Cairo. They are nothing but a small speck on the Salamander continent. The moment Kronos makes up their mind and declares war, we have no choice but to watch as the ground we live on burns and the people die.”</p>
<p>Just like the flowers in a greenhouse, she grew up seeing only the good things in a limited environment. If she had lived like that, she wouldn’t have heard of the harsh realities of the kingdom, but now that she knows them, she can’t go back.</p>
<p>She had seen and heard too many things. In this world, the ever-changing situations implied that peace would not last very long.</p>
<p>“The war has already become a reality. The signs that have been appearing all over the continent indicate that it isn’t a problem that should be ignored any longer. When the time comes, what will Lawrence do? In the battle against Barco, we received help from Roman Dmitry because we couldn’t fight for ourselves, but when another war breaks out, we can’t find a force to lean on as we did back then. Because Kronos will conquer the continent and wipe out all the forces that oppose them.”</p>
<p>She faced reality and looked straight ahead. In the trials to come, Flora Lawrence wanted to do something.</p>
<p>“So when that happens, I need to gain as much experience as possible and develop further.”</p>
<p>“Flora…”</p>
<p>When she left Cairos, she had already made the decision. While looking at her father with sad eyes, Flora Lawrence said in a firm voice,</p>
<p>“I am thinking of joining the Dmitry army.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the next day, just when the aftermath of the party hadn’t cooled down yet, a situation occurred that made Dmitry excited. It was Flora Lawrence’s visit.</p>
<p>Chris, who faced her, had a puzzled face.</p>
<p>“… if I am not mistaken, are you saying that you want to become a member of Dmitry’s staff?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that is right.”</p>
<p>It was a bold statement. And then she added,</p>
<p>“What I want is to be directly under Roman Dmitry’s army. In the future war, the presence of staff members will be needed, and I am sure that Dmitry also needs my talent since I have experienced war on the Western Front. I am not going to request to be treated as a noble. If you use me as a staff member, I will risk my life to serve Dmitry.”</p>
<p>Chris scratched his head. This was unexpected. Flora’s future wasn’t something he could decide, so he said,</p>
<p>“It isn’t for me to decide whether you can join or not. Please wait here. I have to convey this to the Lord, but I am not sure if he will accept you.”</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Flora reacted calmly, and Chris stepped back. He reported it to Roman Dmitry, and his reaction was unexpected.</p>
<p>“Flora Lawrence is a useful resource. If we accept her as a staff member, she will definitely do the job well.”</p>
<p>During the battle in the West, she had proven her worth. In a situation where the West could have collapsed if Kronos’s attack had been successful, her decision to deal quickly with the magicians gave Cairo an advantage.</p>
<p>Not just that, she also gave strength to Roman’s opinion. Thanks to that, Roman Dmitry was able to push forward with his plan easily, and it became an opportunity for him to reconsider Flora Lawrence, whom he had previously viewed negatively.</p>
<p>No prejudice was involved. The past was past, and Roman was judging people based on what he saw and felt.</p>
<p>The current Flora Lawrence—it was clear that she was useful. Moreover, since she was from the northeastern region, it wouldn’t be easy to find such resources with limited manpower.</p>
<p>“However, joining the Dmitry army is a different thing. Tell Flora that one week from now, if she joins the training schedule and proves that she is suitable for the Dmitry army, then I will officially accept her.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Chris took the command and went out. Normal people would see the meaning behind Roman’s words in a different way, but his thoughts were different.</p>
<p>“… does that mean he will refuse her?”</p>
<p>Dmitry’s training—perhaps it was going to be a tough time for Flora Lawrence.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 204 - Wheel Of Fate (4)</p>
<p>In the early morning, breathing in the cold dawn air, the training of Roman Dmitry’s men that was led by Chris began.</p>
<p>“We will start now.”</p>
<p>It was a simple exercise. At first, it was a moderate pace running warm-up, and Flora Lawrence managed to catch up easily with the men.</p>
<p>Her breathing was stable. People usually think that staff members have weak bodies, but she trained in archery, so she didn’t neglect her physical training.</p>
<p>Then slowly, the pace became faster. Flora Lawrence calmed her breathing as much as she could because she didn’t have time to stabilize her breathing to the point where her lungs felt cold.</p>
<p>Just once. It was over once she stopped breathing. In the week-long test, she didn’t want to drop out from the first session itself.</p>
<p><em>“Euk. Euk.”</em></p>
<p>About one hour had passed, and she was already drenched in sweat from the warm-up itself. The heat from her body began to rise from her ponytailed head, and unlike her hot body, the air touching her skin was so cold. The morning training felt a bit intense from the start.</p>
<p>Normal troops would finish their training after about thirty minutes of warm-up, but Dmitry’s soldiers incorporated the morning warm-up as a part of their routine.</p>
<p>And she could finally see the end. She thought they would finally stop now, but Chris entered the mountain path.</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>Anxiety began to rise, and that was just the start. Chris started to run down the steep mountain road, and her brain, which was concentrating on breathing, now felt dizzy.</p>
<p>Her head was spinning. If she had known in advance that this would be the intensity, she would have tried to conserve as much energy as she could. She never thought that they would continue running after an hour of warm-up.</p>
<p>Above all else, unlike her, the soldiers were not even out of breath.</p>
<p><em>“Huk, huk.”</em></p>
<p>Her breathing became rough. This was beyond what she could control. Flora Lawrence held on with her mental strength, and when Chris noticed that she was tenaciously following them, he raised his voice and said,</p>
<p>“The morning training is for survival. The battlefield doesn’t care about your situation. How early the morning is, what you ate, and whether you are healthy. You cannot always fight in the right condition. So push yourself to the limit each day. After exhausting all your stamina, as if you were about to die, you will see the ‘reality’ that you will face on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a training for them to take care of their bodies. It was survival. In order to survive a situation where blood and death were common, the training needed to be intense.</p>
<p>“Physical training is needed for everyone, regardless of their position. Even if it is simply a position that requires you to talk. The place where your role will shine will not be in the barracks but on the battlefield, where the enemy can attack at any time. If you can’t do anything because you don’t have the stamina at that moment and under the pretext that the situation is chaotic, you can’t avoid death on the battlefield. The same is true for every position. Even if your role is to carry things, your legs are needed to fulfill your role.”</p>
<p>He spoke frankly. Seeing Flora Lawrence fall behind, Chris told her the reality.</p>
<p>She knew what his words meant. So she had never neglected her training, but the intensity she was experiencing here was too much.</p>
<p>One hour of warm-up and one hour of mountain running—their two hours of leg training had come to an end.</p>
<p>Flora Lawrence, who completed the training despite being a little behind the others, looked like she was going to die, with sweat dripping down her face.</p>
<p>Her legs were trembling. As she ran, she puked a couple of times, and she was just aching to sit down right away as her head was spinning.</p>
<p>She messed up, though. She wanted to show her strong side, but Chris plunged her into despair.</p>
<p>“From now on, the sword sparring will start!”</p>
<p>The training wasn’t over yet, and hell had just begun.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was an insane schedule. Chris said this about the sword spar, which was pushing them past their limits,</p>
<p>“The most important point on the battlefield is how efficiently you can fight with your physical strength at its maximum. Ten minutes after the first encounter with the enemy. During that time, you need to show the best image that comes to your mind in the perfect state, but after 10 minutes, you will feel tremendous fatigue, as if your body is being pulled down. That is when the real war starts. If your body obeys the control of your mind even when your breathing is not normal and your limbs are not moving freely, then I am sure that even normal soldiers can’t handle you.”</p>
<p>The purpose of this training was clear—extreme limit. The soldiers were being pushed past their limits. Due to the warm-up, everyone was on the verge of exhaustion, yet they went into this training without saying a single word.</p>
<p><em>“Eup!”</em></p>
<p><em>Tatak.</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwang!</em></p>
<p>They were sparring as if it were a real battle. Dmitry’s soldiers breathed steadily and seriously clashed with their opponents.</p>
<p>As Chris said, their bodies weren’t in the best condition now. Even so, their attacks were sharp. They drove their opponents to a corner and attacked their vital points, but the defense of the other soldiers was amazing too.</p>
<p>Intense sparring was happening everywhere in the training room, and Flora Lawrence was shocked.</p>
<p>‘…This is the usual training?’</p>
<p>Dmitry’s training was difficult. Knights who trained their bodies all their lives would even bite their tongues, but the soldiers of Dmitry seemed so used to this.</p>
<p>And that wasn’t all. What kind of sparring was this? Aside from their individual strengths, they still looked menacing, even after running for two hours.</p>
<p>Suddenly, she thought of Dmitry on the battlefield and his strong army. They overpowered the Kronos Empire’s soldiers, who didn’t show any signs of being disturbed by the surprise attack until they appeared.</p>
<p>At that time, she thought they were amazing. They must have been physically exhausted because it was a belated pursuit, but Roman Dmitry’s soldiers were able to push the opponent.</p>
<p>Their driving force was made visible in this training. How could they not be strong when they had incorporated this kind of ridiculous training into their daily routine?</p>
<p>‘In fact, it is a very simple theory to train soldiers with high-intensity training. However, the reason why it can’t be applied in reality is that soldiers hate being pushed to their limits. But Roman Dmitry’s soldiers show no signs of dissatisfaction. Rather, they actively engage in training and show their will to develop themselves.’</p>
<p>Complete control was Roman Dmitry’s ability. The rewards and results showed the soldiers that they were not on the wrong path. And so trust was built.</p>
<p>In the process of destroying Barco, destroying Hector, and then taking down Benedict and Kronos, Dmitry’s soldiers were convinced that they wouldn’t die if they followed Roman Dmitry. So no matter how hard the training was, if they thought their lives were at stake, they had no reason to follow Roman.</p>
<p>Everyone at the training was blazing with enthusiasm. They fought fiercely, and a dangerous situation was created like a real battle. They weren’t worried about having any injuries. They believed that Roman Dmitry would be responsible if any accident happened, and above all, Dmitry had already responded well to accidents that occurred from time to time.</p>
<p>A physician waited with potions ready, and their wounds would be safely treated. The precedent in the past created a scene similar to what Flora was seeing now.</p>
<p>At the heat rising from the men’s bodies, Flora gulped.</p>
<p>‘… I cannot give up.’</p>
<p>It was hard. There was no sign of her recovering from her exhaustion, yet she went to the side to join the spar. Thankfully, her opponent wasn’t assigned yet.</p>
<p>It was about simply practicing against a scarecrow, but Chris’s eyes didn’t allow her a break. It was a situation in which people would fall into self-doubt. But Flora was different. She gritted her teeth at her trembling arms and showed the same intent as before.</p>
<p>‘There is no need to worry. I am not a combat resource, so I am bound to be weak in physical training.’</p>
<p>Yet the time to prove herself had come. Each role was different. Flora Lawrence accepted her flaws and reflected on the meaning behind this training.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days later, Chris reported to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“So far, the training has been carried out without any problems. She collapsed as soon as the first day ended, and on the second day, she showed signs of fainting and dehydration. Of course, that is because she hasn’t fully adapted to our training, but I don’t see any reasons to disqualify her.”</p>
<p>Lack of physical strength wasn’t a reason for disqualification. If a perfect body was what Roman hoped for from the start, then there would be no soldiers under Roman now. Even ordinary people like Henderson were accepted. And the reason they were able to rise to their current level was that they continuously trained themselves, even when they were already exhausted.</p>
<p>So the week-long test was a process to confirm her will. Even knowing how bad the training was, if she had the will to persevere, the path to progress was open. The problem was Flora Lawrence’s role.</p>
<p>“Her fighting ability isn’t good. Her archery is on point, but she has weak close combat skills. There is a clear need to improve in that aspect. But…”</p>
<p>She was a staff member. The area she had to prove herself in was strategy, not combat.</p>
<p>“The tactics training that took place on the third day showed a different result than before. The groups that included Flora won nine out of ten times. She was defeated only once and managed to find an unexpected way to turn the situation around several times.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The report was presented. It was a record of what had happened during the tactical training, and Roman read it. Nine wins came from following the rules. It was a classic strategy of blocking variables as much as possible, but the one thing that stood out the most was her defeat in the last part.</p>
<p>She tried to attack in the standard way as much as possible. She was good at adapting to things and improvising. Actually, her only defeat was because Kevin, the opponent’s commander, made a really sharp attack, and they couldn’t fight back any longer, but they still acknowledged Flora’s ability.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Flora Lawrence showed this kind of level despite not being used to Dmitry’s training yet.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry asked,</p>
<p>“Chris, do you think Flora Lawrence is what Dmitry needs?”</p>
<p>To which Chris answered without any hesitation,</p>
<p>“Yes. I am sure that Dmitry needs a resource like Flora Lawrence.”</p>
<p>The one-week test came to an end.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At the end of the rebellion and the founding of the Dmitry Duchy, half an hour had passed since then. Just as Dmitry was immersed in a peaceful life, Thomas, who ran a restaurant in Dmitry, ran in a hurry.</p>
<p>‘There should still be groceries.’</p>
<p>Recently, Dmitry had a great boom. People who wanted to work in the iron mines flocked to the area, merchants who wanted to do business with them opened stalls, and the entertainment culture naturally developed. It was a good place to live in.</p>
<p>Thomas as well. He ran out of groceries due to the unexpected influx of so many customers and was on his way to get them. Groceries usually run out in the morning, so thinking they might no longer be available, he ran.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>He bumped into a man entering the alley.</p>
<p>The slender man with a robe covering his face gave him a cold look.</p>
<p>“Look where you are going.”</p>
<p>It was a strangely angry voice. Thomas was about to say something in response to the pain but lowered his head when he noticed the eyes of the other person.</p>
<p>Since he met different kinds of people in his restaurant, he knew nothing good would come from fighting such men. The other man looked quite menacing, and it seemed like he wouldn’t even blink an eye when killing someone.</p>
<p>“… I apologize.”</p>
<p>Thomas was right. As he apologized, the man quickly walked away.</p>
<p>It felt like he had been walking for a long time. As the man entered the alleyway, several people suddenly appeared around him like shadows. This was normal for the man.</p>
<p>He spoke in a quiet voice,</p>
<p>“The plan will proceed in three days. Until then, try to lessen the chaos as much as possible and gather information about the security system in Dmitry. Two days later, I will explain the plan.”</p>
<p>“We understand.”</p>
<p>The men backed off. Then, like when they first came, they vanished into the shadows. And the man who gave the orders also moved into the darkness of the alley.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 205 - Dark Night (1)</p>
<p>Dmitry Square.</p>
<p>In a place where people could be seen walking everywhere was a man sitting under a shaded bench and having leisure time.</p>
<p><em>Nomnom.</em></p>
<p>The man was chewing beef jerky. With his robe slightly down, his face was rather pale and sullen, and although he gave off a slightly strange atmosphere, no one cared.</p>
<p>Dmitry attracted people from various places. Among them, there were those from the slums, entertainment districts, and even mercenaries, so a strange-looking person wasn’t a huge deal.</p>
<p>The man’s name was Cliff. He was the sub-master at the assassination guild called Ecorche. He looked around with a calm face.</p>
<p>‘During the hour I stayed here, the guards showed up twice. That means that Dmitry has multiple guards on patrol at intervals. Ordinary estates would never do such things. It requires a good amount of manpower, and the fact that the guards are here is huge. It’s pointless trouble because the estate doesn’t take much damage.’</p>
<p>It was simple logic. If one puts a hundred efforts into preparing for one accident, then they would be forced to solve two accidents, which might not be huge, instead of just one big accident that might not even happen.</p>
<p>Even so, Dmitry maintained tight security. Not just that, but the skills of the guards were good.</p>
<p>‘The rumors in the West seem to be true, ordinary soldiers who showed the same strength as knights. If things go wrong here, I cannot guarantee my own safety.’</p>
<p>He gulped down the jerky. He showed no signs of being nervous. There were many more dangerous things than this that he had attempted in his life, and what he was doing now was only getting information for an assassination.</p>
<p>Overestimate the opponent at all times. It was a famous quote in their guild and in the assassination line itself, and Cliff had no intention of underestimating Dmitry, who was the most unconventional person.</p>
<p>And as time passed, a man came over and sat down. He had a familiar face, like he belonged to the same group, and reported,</p>
<p>“As a result of infiltrating the iron mines and examining the Dmitry estate, it’s been reported that there are very few incidents considering the number of people who have moved here. It is said that the Dmitry guards aren’t just for show. They respond in about five minutes when something happens, and their skills are so great that even mercenaries do not want to touch them. It is the same for the night guards. There are fewer of them than during the day, but compared to other estates, the number of nighttime guards is also high.”</p>
<p>“Anything else?”</p>
<p>“There are many talented people in the estate. We need to watch out for them.”</p>
<p>One night ago, the members of the assassination guild dug up information about Dmitry.</p>
<p>Cliff chuckled.</p>
<p>It was as they had expected. Roman Dmitry seemed to have tightened their security in response to the assassination notice from the Kronos Empire. It was fun. His desperate struggle to live aroused his interest.</p>
<p>“You see. The more the target is like this, the more I feel excited. In a situation where he cannot sleep because of the fear of being attacked at any moment, I will go through everything he has prepared and stab a dagger into his heart. The pleasure of that is amazing.”</p>
<p>Just the thought of it was fun. He gulped and ate the last piece of jerky as he got up.</p>
<p>“Tell the informants. The plan will proceed as scheduled.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day of the showdown.</p>
<p>On a pitch-dark night, the beings in the shadows were hiding very well from the guards who were patrolling. And among them, a man in a gray cloak said,</p>
<p>“From this point on, the number of guards will increase as we head further inside. The interval between the enemies arriving at the same point is about 15 minutes, and we have to enter within that 15-minute time frame. Keep in mind that Kronos does not allow failure. Even if we have succeeded in every assassination under the command of the empire, a single failure is enough for them to turn against us.”</p>
<p>Cliff said. This operation put the fate of the guild at stake. Because his master begged him to succeed in this, Cliff’s attitude was different from usual.</p>
<p>“I will take the lead. Deal with the guards and quickly dispose of the corpses.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The subordinates nodded their heads. After confirming the location of the guards, Cliff manifested the ability of the gray cloak he was wearing.</p>
<p>“Invisibility.”</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>Soft light rose, and the light from the gray cloak enveloped Cliff’s body, and he became invisible. It was a magic artifact. Assassins tend to use many tools to kill beings stronger than them, and the gray cloak was the most expensive for killing a strong opponent.</p>
<p>Moving cautiously, they approached the guards.</p>
<p>‘Only two enemies. According to the guard system that we figured out, if we go straight to the castle after dealing with them, we will only encounter guards once. Roman Dmitry. I don’t know what kind of existence you are on the battlefield, but you won’t be able to withstand an assassination that takes place under the cover of darkness.’</p>
<p>All this while, they had killed many strong people. There were also beings called Rankers among them, but there was no way they could handle an unprepared attack, and this would be no different.</p>
<p>Cliff followed the guards. He could hear them breathing. Seeing the guards looking around, unaware of their coming deaths, Cliff raised his dagger, and at the moment he was about to cut a guard’s throat….</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p>‘…?!’</p>
<p>The attack was blocked. The guard turned around and blocked it. It was an embarrassing situation. When the guard and Cliff looked at each other, the guard blew a whistle.</p>
<p><em>Beeep!</em></p>
<p>“Enemies! Enemies have appeared!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was confusing. He was just a guard. Cliff didn’t know if it was about entering the place, but he never thought that a problem would come up right at the start of the plan.</p>
<p>“Damn it. Hurry up and deal with these people!”</p>
<p>He shouted. The guild members who had been hiding came out at once and attacked the guards to erase their traces.</p>
<p>However….</p>
<p><em>Kang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kakang!</em></p>
<p>The movements of the guards were unusual. They were not pushed back even though it was a surprise attack, and the two guards who protected each other blocked them.</p>
<p>Only then did Cliff’s mouth go dry. At first, he thought the guards were lucky enough to block the attack, but now he could see that they were not ordinary guards.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p><em>Beep!</em></p>
<p>“There!”</p>
<p>In an instant, Dmitry’s soldiers appeared and surrounded them, and Cliff and the assassins missed the opportunity to escape.</p>
<p>It was a crisis. At Cliff’s signal, the assassins gathered in one place. Assassins who were strong in ambushes were weak in head-on fights, but right now, they didn’t have any other means to survive.</p>
<p>They held their daggers. Their invisibility had already been released while attempting to attack.</p>
<p>Cliff looked nervous. The soldiers of Dmitry—the moment he checked the face of one of them, he couldn’t help but be shocked.</p>
<p>“… You…. You!?”</p>
<p>It was a familiar face. In his memory, the face of the restaurant owner, Thomas, whom he bumped into a couple of days ago, was the same person in front of him now.</p>
<p>His heart raced. This operation went terribly wrong right from the start.</p>
<p>“Cliff. The sub-master of the assassination guild Ecorche. The reason you set foot in Dmitry is that you were instructed by Kronos.”</p>
<p>The guard who stopped his attack stepped forward, and looking at his face now, he recognized him. He couldn’t recognize him earlier because of the disguise, but in the information that he had studied in advance, there was something about a man named Lucas.</p>
<p>“A fortnight ago, we received information that Ecorche’s assassins had set foot on Dmitry. You would have thought that you managed to conceal your identity completely, but we knew about your full-scale operation three days ago. Judging by the look on your face, you must be wondering how we figured it out.”</p>
<p>Lower District Sect. Lucas created an information guild. The people in the lower districts reported everything they saw in their daily lives. It wasn’t much, but by combining them, Lucas could obtain useful information.</p>
<p>“The restaurant owner whom you first met when you set foot in Dmitry. He belonged to the information guild of Dmitry. When you looked around in the plaza, the merchant was also from the guild. And that’s not all. The innkeepers, the blacksmiths, and the miners in the iron mines—they are all the eyes and ears of Dmitry, who told us about the strange things they witnessed. From then on, finding out your identities wasn’t so difficult. It is an open fact that Kronos hired some assassins, and I thought Ecorche was the suitable tool for that.”</p>
<p>From the start, Dmitry just ignored their presence, even though they knew they were looking around for information, and timed the shift change of the guards.</p>
<p>Lucas was paired up with Henderson. And in other parts of the estate, manpower was deployed to prepare for enemy attacks.</p>
<p>By attacking in the dark, Cliff thought his plan was perfect, but from the start to the end, they were only Lucas’s toys.</p>
<p>‘… I will die at this rate.’</p>
<p>Cliff looked around at what he didn’t expect. When he received the order to assassinate Roman Dmitry, he didn’t think it would be such a problem. Predicting what they were doing behind the scenes was not an easy thing to do. But how could they figure it out so perfectly?</p>
<p>After all, in order to enter the castle, they had to run into people. No matter how much he concealed his identity and used the cloak, all the information was flowing into the lower district.</p>
<p>In addition, Lucas didn’t miss a single change. Having cornered the assassins, he gave the signal to the soldiers.</p>
<p>“Attack.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Cliff also shouted.</p>
<p>“Open the path! Break through the enemies and head straight for the castle!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The assassins—the reason they were strong was that they attacked at the time they wanted. This meant that, on the contrary, they were weak in a head-on fight.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p><em>“Ack.”</em></p>
<p>It was a one-sided fight. As soon as they bumped into each other, Dmitry’s soldiers charged at the assassins, and one after another, the assassins fell without even exchanging a couple of hits.</p>
<p>At least Cliff’s presence stood out. He showed a ferocious appearance with his dagger, which had a sharpness spell on it.</p>
<p>Lucas rushed at him, and as he pressed him on, Cliff was quickly cornered.</p>
<p>‘Strong.’</p>
<p>Lucas’s presence stood out during the recruitment. He fell into the information guild because he had other uses. Still, he had experience fighting on the battlefield, and he possessed combat abilities that were as strong as those in the top ranks of Roman Dmitry’s men.</p>
<p>He used a sword and a dagger that were shorter than normal. And after brilliantly using those two weapons, he cut open the opponent’s chest at once.</p>
<p><em>Swish!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>Cliff screamed. As he backed away, Lucas kicked him in the ankle and knocked him down.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>It was over. When Cliff got up again, the sword was pointed at his throat.</p>
<p>“I’m giving you ten seconds right now. Explain why I should spare you.”</p>
<p><em>Schwing.</em></p>
<p>The sword cut his neck. Seeing the blood flowing down the blade of his sword, Cliff smiled like he had lost his mind.</p>
<p>“Fucking bugs, do not be mistaken that you won. Even though you predicted that the Kronos Empire would send assassins, the reason they hired us was because they were convinced that we would somehow make the operation work. I bet you know. Our real sword is separate. Along with that, assassins attacking from all sides will come crashing into the castle now.”</p>
<p>He grinned. He was going to die anyway, and that was why he wanted to see the opponent panic. He wasn’t the only one involved in this plan.</p>
<p>Ecorche tried to attack in four directions based on how they would handle it, so the sword of Ecorche moved separately. It was an operation that was bound to succeed.</p>
<p>He was recognized for his leadership and his years of service and then rose to the position of sub-master, but in fact, he wasn’t that skilled. He was just bait. Hence, the plan would succeed.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Now that we know that, any more information?”</p>
<p>The opponent’s reaction made Cliff’s eye twitch. Seeing him calmly accept the remarks, his heart sank.</p>
<p>Lucas had a cold look.</p>
<p>“If you don’t have anything else to say, you have no choice but to die.”</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p><em>“Grrr.”</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered everywhere. With the sword that had cut his throat, Cliff tried to block the wound with his hand, but he just collapsed.</p>
<p>Dealing with all of them, Lucas wiped the blood off and said,</p>
<p>“Group 2, organize your surroundings. And the first group will follow me from now on. We will form a siege based on their resistance so that the enemies cannot escape.”</p>
<p>They didn’t have to worry about anything. The things that were happening inside were Roman Dmitry’s plan, not his.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 206 - Dark Night (2)</p>
<p>The assassination guild Ecorche. The reason they were able to rise to their current position was thanks to their special assassin, called Ecorche’s Sword.</p>
<p>A total of nine murders. Ecorche’s Sword, who aimed for prominent figures, not only succeeded in killing all nine times, but he also did cruel acts such as peeling off the skin of his targets.</p>
<p>This assassination would be his 10th murder. On the monumental day of reaching the double digits, Cort, the assassin, felt a surge of excitement.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. If he’s the most talked-about person on the continent lately, he’d be perfect for my 10th target.’</p>
<p>What sound would he make when he died? Rumor has it that he was so cruel that not a single drop of blood could be cut from him, but no matter what kind of life a human has, death would humble him.</p>
<p>He had blended into the darkness and perfectly figured out Dmitry’s guard system. But still, just in case, he sent the assassins of the guild in four directions, and he intended to target Roman Dmitry while they drew the attention away.</p>
<p>He already knew where his opponent was. A mouse tamed with Familiar Magic was sent to Roman Dmitry’s room, and even the fact that he entered the room to sleep was confirmed by the mouse’s eyes.</p>
<p>The room was quiet, and there was only steady breathing. It wasn’t a fake sleep. His sensitive senses could grasp the state of his opponent, and the invisible waves from the human body confirmed that he was asleep.</p>
<p>He had done and succeeded in all nine assassinations in the same manner. No matter how strong a swordsman was, he was bound to be the same human being when asleep, and they all died in the same state without even noticing what had happened.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>He raised his mana. He was not a magician, but through the magic circle engraved on his body, he temporarily shared the sight of the mouse.</p>
<p>‘Foolish guy. He doesn’t know what is happening in Dmitry and is asleep.’</p>
<p>He had been asleep for an hour and had now reached a stable state. Cort moved very cautiously. Just like Cliff, he used an invisibility cloak and raised his mana to minimize the sound of his footsteps.</p>
<p>His movements were like those of a swift cat. Climbing up the tall wall, he entered the building, and even though the guards were passing by, he quickly dug inside using the darkness.</p>
<p>The structure inside the building was clear in his head. They mobilized to check the structure of the surroundings for fifteen days and calculated the shortest path to Roman Dmitry’s room.</p>
<p>How long did it take to get there? How long did the guards patrol? And where was the quickest escape route if any other variables arose?</p>
<p>He had already sorted out the variables, so Cort’s movements were bold. In an instant, he had reached the front of Roman Dmitry’s room and activated a magic artifact to block out the noise.</p>
<p><em>‘Silence.’</em></p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>The door opened. It was a detailed element. Beings with sensitive senses wake up at the slightest sound of the door being opened, so Cort even blocked that sound. His assassinations had always been this way.</p>
<p>He never really participated much in normal assassinations, but he always killed the targets himself and followed the same method when they were important figures. He perfectly calculated the locations of the targets, and he had the ability to follow the plans thoroughly. When the bodies with their skins peeled off were found the next morning, people trembled at the name Ecorche.</p>
<p>And so he stepped inside the room. Then he pulled out his dagger. He approached Roman Dmitry and tried to kill him, but Roman Dmitry suddenly got up. And….</p>
<p>“A rat.”</p>
<p>His gaze was directed at where Cort was standing, who was covered with the invisibility cloak.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Last night, Lucas reported something.</p>
<p>“The movements of the enemy are unusual. Considering that there was a time when the lines of their movements overlapped, it seems that they are finally moving in for a full-scale operation. It is clear that they will execute their operation in a few days. From now on, I will strengthen the security and even set up traps in case they move.”</p>
<p>Ecorche’s plan was discovered from the start. Knowing that they would attempt the assassination today, Roman Dmitry went to sleep.</p>
<p>What Cort figured out wasn’t a lie—the waves of energy that he felt and how Roman was asleep until he reached the door were all real.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry had a dream. It was the life of Baek Joong-hyuk. Until the very end, he couldn’t be careless. His siblings always pursued his life, and they all lived so fiercely that not even a cup of tea could be sipped carelessly without worrying if it contained poison.</p>
<p>At first, he stayed up all night with his eyes open. He had to prepare for an assassin who might come at him at any time, and he had to heighten his senses to scan the room constantly.</p>
<p>One day, two days, and soon more than a year had passed. Baek Joong-hyuk realized he could no longer live like that—staying up at night, pretending to be asleep, and acting—he had reached the limit.</p>
<p>He decided that he needed a break for himself and for the future, so he learned to defend himself against enemies with minimal effort from then on.</p>
<p>So he closed his eyes. Even though he was aware of the assassin’s existence, he went to sleep, and instead, he tried to react with the slightest movements that wouldn’t tip them off.</p>
<p>At first, it was dangerous. There was a time when he almost died because he couldn’t get up until the weapon was close to his nose, and there was a time when his throat was slashed, and blood gushed out.</p>
<p>But he had to do it. The fact that he would eventually collapse both mentally and physically by staying awake was clear, so he prepared for the assassins with minimal effort.</p>
<p>And at some point, his senses became sharp. Even while sleeping, he was alert to his surroundings, and he would wake up the moment he sensed any change.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>It was a cautious step without any sound. However, Cort wasn’t that skilled, and the moment he reached the door, Roman was already aware of his presence.</p>
<p>Numerous assassins sought his life in Murim, and compared to them, Cort was nothing. Even while sleeping, eating, and moving, he had experienced assassination too many times, so he boldly went to sleep.</p>
<p>Did Cort know? More than the number of assassinations he did—no, out of all of Ecorche’s assassinations, the number of assassination attempts on Roman Dmitry was a lot more.</p>
<p>That was the variable that Cort didn’t predict.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He got goosebumps. The moment his opponent looked at him, Cort knew that something had gone wrong. However…</p>
<p>‘I cannot fail.’</p>
<p>The operation had begun. Assassins were attacking from all sides, so there was no need to wait anymore. The problem was that the opponent was a 5-star aura swordsman. He had heard about Gustavo dying, yet he didn’t hesitate.</p>
<p>“Hold.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>A magical artifact manifested. At the same time….</p>
<p>“Haste.”</p>
<p>He used buff magic. Cort was equipped with various weapons as he was the best assassin in the guild, and the moment he clashed with his opponent, he rushed at him.</p>
<p>His speed and strength quickly increased. In addition, his aura and the dagger he held proved that he was not a normal assassin.</p>
<p><em>Grrrng!</em></p>
<p>A 4-star aura. He was not in the Rankings. Even though his skill wasn’t known to the world, surprise attacks based on his 4-star aura brought him success nine times. So it wasn’t an arrogant decision for him to attack Roman.</p>
<p>Since he had thoroughly prepared himself, he judged that he had a good chance of winning if he caught him off guard.</p>
<p><em>Euk!</em></p>
<p>One hit. The wind was cut off. Roman Dmitry turned his head to avoid it, and the moment their eyes met, Cort hurriedly backed away.</p>
<p><em>Tatatak!</em></p>
<p>Nothing happened. Roman Dmitry put his hand on his sword but didn’t pull it out. However, to Cort’s eyes, Roman Dmitry’s sword blew his head off. It felt like his feet were sinking. Even though they hadn’t properly exchanged blows, Cort’s face was drenched in sweat.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>Sweat dripped. Cort swallowed and lowered his stance.</p>
<p>‘If I am a little careless, I will die.’</p>
<p>His instincts told him. He was such a dangerous enemy. Even for Cort, who had defeated nine strong opponents, this was the first time in his life that he had experienced this.</p>
<p>There was breath-taking silence. When Cort kicked the ground again, he raised his aura to the maximum.</p>
<p><em>Papat.</em></p>
<p>He was fast. His body moved like a beast, and he threw daggers, aiming for his opponent’s gaps.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry dodged most of them and hit the last one with his sword.</p>
<p>It was his chance. Cort dug into the gap in his opponent’s arms, and after inducing him to defend his lower body, he quickly turned around and stabbed the dagger under his chin. It was a surprise attack.</p>
<p>When the opponent tilted his head, he used aura and aimed for his vital points. At that fleeting moment, he attacked six times. Cort’s attacks were threatening, but the moment he stopped attacking, bright red blood splashed everywhere.</p>
<p><em>Splat!</em></p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>His arm flew off. He couldn’t even feel it. He thought that he had the advantage, but it was his arm that flew. This made him go pale. Roman Dmitry’s fame wasn’t false. The moment Roman Dmitry, who killed Gustavo, was aware of the assassination, fighting him head-on was stupid.</p>
<p>Was it because of the symbolic meaning of the 10th assassination? As for Cort, he made a reckless decision.</p>
<p>‘It’s over.’</p>
<p>His defeat was sure. The assassination failed, and now he had to survive, leaving behind the responsibility.</p>
<p>“Flash.”</p>
<p>He used a magic bomb. The magic bomb was used at full power, and a pure white light exploded, blinding his opponent. And then, he ran right away.</p>
<p>When the light subsided, Cort’s figure was gone, and blood dripped down the path he had fled.</p>
<p>Roman followed the trail. There was no need to rush. The moment the enemy stepped in with resistance, he had already fallen into a trap that he couldn’t escape from.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The pain was intense. With a hand around his bloodstained arm, Cort was running to the retreat path he had thought of in advance.</p>
<p>‘Damn it. This operation was a complete failure. With the power of Roman Dmitry that I experienced, the situation wouldn’t change even if the guild members arrived. Rather, Dmitry’s soldiers will swarm this place, and we won’t be able to escape.’</p>
<p>His goal was to survive. Once he reached the path that the guild members had secured, he witnessed another shocking scene.</p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>It was an assassin of Ecorche. One of them collapsed with a scream. A battle broke out at the corner of the path that was supposed to be their escape route, and the person who was leading the troops of Dmitry was someone he knew.</p>
<p>Chris—the existence the entire guild was wary of. Chris was such a great threat that they even did an internal evaluation to avoid clashing with him as much as possible.</p>
<p>And in his hands, the assassins were dying. Not only did they fail to kill Roman Dmitry, but the situation outside was looking bad as well.</p>
<p>‘No. Did they actually expect our plan?’</p>
<p>From the series of events, Roman’s reaction to the assassination and the fact that a battle was taking place outside confirmed it.</p>
<p>But, of course, the truth was only half right. It was true that Dmitry saw through their plan, but it was Roman’s ability that made the assassination fail. In a normal sense, one couldn’t think this far.</p>
<p>Cort turned around and ran in the other direction. However….</p>
<p>“…This.”</p>
<p>Things were not different there. No, everyone was dead.</p>
<p>Among the corpses scattered everywhere, someone was standing, and he looked at Cort. He also knew him well—it was Kevin.</p>
<p>Kevin, with a colder face than usual, was waiting for Cort to come his way very eagerly so that he himself could kill him.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 207 - Dark Night (3)</p>
<p>Assassination. It was the act of secretly killing people. When the Kronos Empire said they would assassinate Roman Dmitry, Kevin briefly thought of Roman dying.</p>
<p>The Lord he trusted was not someone who could be assassinated. He didn’t know how he would die, but if his death came, it wouldn’t be in a meaningless way like that.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was his sky and his God. Just the mere thought of the death of the being who was in the sky made his blood boil in rage. [TL/N: Sky like the limit, which cannot be touched.]</p>
<p>At first, he was worried, but soon he got angry. If anyone tried to assassinate him, he wanted to tear them down limb by limb. He was going to set an example of what happens when someone tries such things on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>And now he has found Cort. The moment Cort gritted his teeth and tried to run away, Kevin rushed toward him.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>“It is you!”</p>
<p>Ecorche’s Sword. It was the target that Lucas had told him about. Kevin quickly closed the distance with his opponent, and Cort frowned as he raised his aura.</p>
<p>He didn’t have the confidence to shake off Kevin with his wounded body. And if he fought him face to face? With his skills as a 4-star aura swordsman, he was confident of at least wounding Kevin.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>The aura was splitting the space. Kevin dodged the attack and then moved close enough to feel his breath.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>The sword cut through his legs. It was fast. Cort turned his dagger and tried to attack Kevin, but Kevin kept a good distance from him and didn’t back down at all.</p>
<p>From a distance, they clashed again. It was obvious that the moment he made even the slightest mistake, his neck would fly off, but Kevin followed him like a hunting dog with no fear.</p>
<p>Blood splattered. While avoiding Cort’s attacks, Kevin was leaving wounds on his opponent’s body. Clearly, Cort should have the upper hand. Kevin’s aura was weaker than Cort’s, but losing his arm hindered him from demonstrating his skills.</p>
<p>Besides, the opponent was also moving boldly. Kevin was following him like a ghost who coveted death.</p>
<p><em>Huk.</em></p>
<p>With the distance of a hair, the attack missed. The screams of the demons within Kevin’s head indicated the direction the attack would come, so Kevin tilted his head.</p>
<p>It was truly such an unconventional way to fight. It had been just two years since he trained swordsmanship through Roman Dmitry, and it was only normal for him to be defeated by a 4-star aura swordsman.</p>
<p>However, Kevin lived in a world beyond the normal sense. As he followed Roman’s path, he realized that aura wasn’t what made one win.</p>
<p>Everyone was the same. Even an aura swordsman would die if their neck were cut, and he had experienced things that convinced him about that. The beings that he had encountered in the past. All of them were stronger beings than Kevin, but they were all stained with pain, unable to accept reality.</p>
<p>It was the same now. Kevin went for his opponent’s weak point—since he had lost an arm, he attacked him on that side. His attack disrupted his balance, and even though Cort was stronger, he couldn’t do much now. The martial arts of Crazy Demon had seeped into Kevin’s presence.</p>
<p>The moment Cort targeted his vital points, Kevin jumped into the aura and responded back in the same way.</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>They clashed. Cort’s eyes shook as he was a step late. Even in the situation where the aura hit his face, Kevin boldly chose to attack the opponent’s vitals.</p>
<p>How could one make such an absurd decision? There was no fear in Kevin’s eyes as he looked at him. Rather, it seemed like he was sure that his decision was right.</p>
<p>‘… We took the wrong request.’</p>
<p>He wasn’t Roman Dmitry. He wasn’t even Chris, whom they evaluated as the next dangerous one, but he was Kevin, and he was beyond their imagination. Unless they were dreaming, they were bound to fail at this request right from the start.</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>And his head was hit. Seeing Cort lying on the floor, Kevin looked down at him with cold eyes.</p>
<p>“If my Lord hadn’t told me not to kill you, I would have cut off your flesh one by one while you were still conscious. Do not feel so grateful, though. You won’t feel happy to be alive.”</p>
<p>With those words…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>It was the last scene that Cort remembered.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How long was it? When Cort came to his senses, he could see candles shining on a table in the room. Pain rose. He wasn’t dead yet. Then, it was clear why he was still alive.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry wants something from me. If it’s not for that reason, there is no reason for him to save me. I will tell him what he wants. I will give him information if he wants information and loyalty too. I need to be alive so that I can make him pay for the humiliation I have gone through.’</p>
<p>In the world of assassins, if they saw this, his life would be over. He gritted his teeth at the pain from his arm, and his eyes showed intent to take revenge. It was then…</p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened, and a man entered inside. It was Lucas. Cort tried to look at what Lucas would do, but Lucas didn’t even meet his eyes once and placed something next to him.</p>
<p>This made Cort lose his mind. What was revealed inside the leather cover were clearly weapons for torture.</p>
<p>“Ah, no, let’s start with the conversation… <em>Kuak!</em>”</p>
<p>It started with his nails. One by one, Lucas removed his fingernails and then his toenails. When all of his nails were gone, and he was profusely bleeding, Lucas took out another tool and gave a new form of pain to the opponent.</p>
<p>There was no conversation. For a whole week, Cort was tortured. With his mind slowly crumbling, Cort no longer even groaned.</p>
<p>“… Please, please, just kill me.”</p>
<p>In a week, he gave up hope in life. He knew that the thought that he might live was useless.</p>
<p>And then Lucas looked at him and said,</p>
<p>“Cort, Ecorche’s Sword. We are not going to kill you. The Lord instructed me to make an example of the men who try to attack Dmitry and what happens to them. Except for you, all the assassins are dead. And the traces of pain I have left on you will let everyone know what happens if they touch Dmitry.”</p>
<p>He went closer. Then he took out a vial of clear liquid and poured it into Cort’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Drink.”</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p>It wasn’t like he could refuse. Since he hadn’t even had a sip of water until now, Cort drank it, knowing it was poison.</p>
<p>“A week ago, the Lord left for the Kronos Empire and found out that your stronghold isn’t too far from Cairo. From now on, I will release you. Therefore…”</p>
<p>He smiled. Lucas wasn’t a kind person.</p>
<p>“If you want to live, run at full speed. Before my Lord kills your Lord.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The master of Ecorche, Bracan, received a call from his client.</p>
<p>[It has already been a week. Isn’t it enough to know the mission has failed?]</p>
<p>“Please wait a little longer. Our Sword never fails. There aren’t any rumors about a failed assassination either, and the whereabouts of Roman Dmitry have been unknown for the past week. Now is not the time to speak of the results, but please wait and be confident in our abilities.”</p>
<p>[I get it. But keep in mind that the price of failure will not be small.]</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off. Bracan felt dizzy at the words of the other person.</p>
<p>‘Is it a failure?’</p>
<p>It had already been one week. Actually, it was already past the deadline. Although he had already accepted the possibility of failure, Bracan didn’t reveal that because the client was the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>The Emperor had announced that he would assassinate Roman Dmitry, and what would be the price if he failed? A great reward was offered by the empire, and the guild accepted it, only to realize how foolish it was.</p>
<p>But he could not give up. Kronos’s request was Roman Dmitry’s death. Although their Sword failed, they had more assassins in the guild.</p>
<p>‘From now on, we must cancel all our current missions and aim to take down Roman Dmitry first. Even if it means losing most of the members, if we can kill him, then we can make a comeback with Kronos’s support.’</p>
<p>It felt like he was bleeding. Their assassins had completed numerous missions, and the assassination industry recognized their achievements.</p>
<p>And the fact that the opponent was a 5-star aura swordsman didn’t matter. Of course, it was a dangerous mission for them too, but they were certain that they would succeed.</p>
<p>Cliff, Cort, and a dozen more assassins. They had the power to kill the King of Cairo if they wanted to, but not a single one of them made contact.</p>
<p>Driven to a corner, Bracan rose from his chair and admitted that it was time for him to step in. It was then…..</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The light of the lamp went off, then it turned on again. At Bracan’s office, he was alone late at night. As the lantern flickered, he moved to fix it. At that moment….</p>
<p><em>Flash!</em></p>
<p>The lights turned on, and at the same time, the mysterious presence in the room made his heart sink.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One second. The opponent’s face was familiar. At first, he couldn’t recognize the face properly because it was in the darkness, but based on the data he was looking at a couple of seconds ago, it told him.</p>
<p>The order to kill Roman Dmitry. The very first page had Roman Dmitry’s face, and this man had the same face.</p>
<p>Two seconds. He opened his eyes. The moment he was convinced it was Roman Dmitry, Bracan took a step back while swinging the dagger from his waist.</p>
<p>Three seconds. All of his attacks were blocked, but it didn’t matter. He didn’t even think he could kill Roman in the first place.</p>
<p>He was in the Kronos Empire now. It was said that their base was not far from Cairo’s border, but only a few people knew about that.</p>
<p>The plan to assassinate Roman Dmitry failed. Figures like Cort would have died on the spot, and how Dmitry found their location was clear. Then this was an opportunity. He had to kill Roman Dmitry right here and complete the request.</p>
<p>Four seconds. While throwing more daggers, he groped for something under the table. It was the emergency bell. If he informed them of the situation, the dozens of assassins outside would rush in.</p>
<p>Five seconds.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>His arm fell. Bracan’s face was stained with pain, and he fell to the ground. Blood splashed everywhere.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry had pulled out his sword before Bracan even realized it and cut off his arm.</p>
<p>His head was spinning, and it felt like his thoughts were blocked. While stepping into the assassination industry, he knew that he would not die nicely, but he had no idea that Roman Dmitry’s assassination mission would have such an outcome.</p>
<p>This was Kronos. What madman would step into an empire because someone tried to assassinate them?</p>
<p><em>“… Kuak.“</em></p>
<p>He groaned. Dragging his other arm, he tried to get away from Roman Dmitry. He hoped his subordinates would hear the commotion and rush inside. However, those were false hopes that would never come true.</p>
<p><em>Glance.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry confirmed the emergency bell’s location.</p>
<p>“Pressing this will call your men here.”</p>
<p>Roman knew what he was thinking, and when he looked up at Roman with a pale face, wait….</p>
<p><em>Beep!</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry pressed the emergency bell while looking straight at Bracan.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 208 - Dark Night (4)</p>
<p>The bell rang loudly. Roman Dmitry sat on the chair and looked over at the data Bracan had.</p>
<p>“If Ecorche fails to assassinate me and the guild dies in return, how do you think the assassination industry will react?”</p>
<p>It was an incomprehensible question. Bracan looked into Roman Dmitry’s eyes. He couldn’t understand why he pressed the bell and why he didn’t run.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is as belligerent as the rumors. Normally, people don’t react this extremely just because there was an assassination attempt, but he is a madman who even crossed the borders of the Kronos Empire for the purpose of revenge. Judging from his question, his goal is Ecorche. Then there is still a chance to turn things around.’</p>
<p>He tried using his head. The number of opponents was unpredictable. There might have been more enemies outside than expected, but the possibility of winning was low. The reason was the contents of the report he received the other day.</p>
<p>Bracan made a request to the information guild to figure out Dmitry’s situation, and he received a message related to him yesterday—the whereabouts of Roman Dmitry were unknown and instead of him, his subordinates were there.</p>
<p>Chris, Kevin, Henderson, and the others were all in Dmitry, and there wasn’t any report of them moving for any particular reason. That meant Roman Dmitry was most likely moving alone. And assuming that he decided to prevent the guild from assessing the situation and escaping, then that train of thought was definitely right.</p>
<p>It was reckless, and it wasn’t a common decision. However, considering the steps that Roman Dmitry took, it was a sufficiently realistic theory.</p>
<p>Bracan said,</p>
<p>“… If our guild perishes, the assassination industry will turn upside down. Ecorche is by far the best guild except for the Black Castle and the White Moon, which are the two largest guilds. And that means that you cannot act however you want.”</p>
<p>His attitude changed. He exaggerated about his guild on purpose. He scratched the pride of his opponent, and this made him feel nice.</p>
<p>“As you said, that bell will call my subordinates. There are dozens of assassins out there. Can you handle all of them? Roman Dmitry. I admit that you are strong. But the longer you stay here, the more assassins and troops of Kronos will flock here.”</p>
<p>It was a trick to buy some time. Instead of retreating, people with pride would take this opportunity to stand up and prove themselves. If that happened, things would go according to Bracan’s plan. It was clear that the guild members, who would storm into the office, would overpower Roman right away.</p>
<p>However….</p>
<p>“There are about thirty men left in this base. Excluding those that went out on missions, that would be the only power you can mobilize right now. Bracan, please, you do not have strength on your side.”</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt goosebumps rise.</p>
<p><em>Tatak.</em></p>
<p>There was a sound of footsteps in the distance. As if he had waited, Roman stood up with a  calm expression.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The guild members entered the office. The first scene they saw was Roman Dmitry sitting and Bracan bleeding.</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>There was no need for any explanations. The assassins rushed in. They threw daggers from all sides and attacked Roman Dmitry simultaneously.</p>
<p>It was a well-coordinated attack. One to his head, one to his right, one to his left, and one for each leg. And the assassins who arrived late also threw daggers, aiming for the gaps they found.</p>
<p>It was a menacing sight. In a situation where he was stepping into death, Roman swung his sword.</p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p>All the daggers bounced back. At the same time, he grabbed the head of an assassin who was attacking, dragged him along with him, and slammed his face into the wall.</p>
<p><em>Crush.</em></p>
<p>An eerie sound was heard. Roman Dmitry left the corpse, not caring about the blood, and avoided the attacks.</p>
<p>The moment their eyes met, a single flash blew off the opponent’s neck. Then he smashed the face of another opponent.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The human skull was hard. It was invulnerable to normal attacks, but it didn’t have any meaning in the face of the monstrous strength Roman had.</p>
<p>In the narrow space, the assassins and Roman Dmitry fought. Among the assassins, there were also those who used auras, and they specialized in fighting in small spaces.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded. At the forefront, the assassins who used aura rushed in, and some figured to move alongside the wall, aiming for his blind spot.</p>
<p>Daggers were thrown without giving Roman a chance to breathe. The timing of their attacks would have resulted in one to two wounds, but Roman Dmitry didn’t waver even in such a situation.</p>
<p>Daggers continued to fly at him, and they all bounced back. Then an assassin who thrust his sword, hoping for Roman to move to his side, had his head blown off. And the assassins rushing from the sides were no different.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry picked up one body and used it as a shield against the daggers, and he smashed another one in the face. Blood splattered everywhere. The blood of the assassins was staining the walls, turning them red.</p>
<p>One, two, and more bodies kept piling up. The assassins, who showed confidence at first, noticed that the situation wasn’t good.</p>
<p>Something was wrong. Aside from the fact that Roman Dmitry was strong, the man hasn’t used aura until now. He was just using all of his body’s force. The fact that he was dealing with so many assassins meant that something was wrong.</p>
<p>However, in the world of assassination, there was no such thing as a retreat. People who lived with death every day knew that retreating meant losing everything. Finally….</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>Even the last assassin had his head cut off. His face, stricken with fear, floated in the air, and his headless body fell to the ground.</p>
<p>Just five minutes—that was the time it took him to take down the entire guild.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bracan was at a loss for words. It was shocking. During the battle, he tried to attack with his one remaining arm, but he couldn’t bring himself to do it after seeing what was happening.</p>
<p>His eyes darted in every direction. It was hard to see how Roman Dmitry was taking down his opponents, even though he wasn’t using aura. What was certain was that when the blood splattered everywhere, the assassins met their deaths without fail.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t care about him. He just brushed off the blood from his sword and moved on, passing through Bracan and approaching the vault behind him. And then….</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>He cut it open with one strike. The vault of the guild was made of layers of steel, which meant it couldn’t be destroyed with pure force. However, it was cleanly cut. The steel fell, revealing what was stored inside, and Roman Dmitry checked the papers.</p>
<p>‘Ecorche is an assassination guild whose main clients are from the Kronos Empire. In addition to killing me, I can guess the intention of Kronos based on who the targets are.’</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>He turned the papers over. The past was not important. What caught his eye was something else.</p>
<p>[1st Degree Assassination Calderon Drake]</p>
<p>[1st Degree Assassination Count London]</p>
<p>Two people—they were names that Roman was familiar with. Calderon Drake was the eldest son of the Drake family, and his father, Marquis Drake, was a key figure in the Umberto Kingdom. He was also the head of the military. When the nation was shaken by the ongoing war, he was a very upright man who insisted on not compromising until the end.</p>
<p>People said that the moment Marquis Drake knelt, that would be the day Umberto would fall. But what if… what would happen if his son died? Those who talked of compromising with Kronos—Marquis Drake would be convinced that they did it.</p>
<p>It was a simple way to bring down the Umberto Kingdom. Even though it wasn’t something huge, Marquis Drake was what Kronos could use to bring the kingdom down.</p>
<p>And Count London. He was a rich man from the Redford Kingdom, and unlike his notoriety as a miser, he was truly a hero who helped the nation from the shadows.</p>
<p>Their King had a huge debt, and Count London hurriedly moved to solve it. Knowing that once a conflict with the Golden Bank started, there was no turning back, he saved the nation from dying. Only then did the wealth that he already had begin to increase. And if he goes down, then the Redford Kingdom will too.</p>
<p>Just from the names of those two people, it was clear what the Kronos Empire’s intentions were. They weren’t defeating their enemies through war, but they were making a mess of their nations.</p>
<p>By slowly gnawing out the kingdoms from the inside, even if the Kingdoms’ Alliance all joined forces, there would be no way to stop Kronos’s attack.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>He burned the documents, and….</p>
<p>“… is there a way for me to survive?”</p>
<p>Bracan said. He didn’t have a hostile attitude. He admitted defeat.</p>
<p>And in a manner so polite, Roman looked down at him,</p>
<p>“None.”</p>
<p>He ended it with that.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry cut off his head.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Cort ran like a man whose foot was on fire. His body wasn’t in the best state after a week of torture, and every time he stepped on the ground, a terrible pain ran through his head.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t stop. Knowing that their base would be in danger if he stood still, he knew looking after himself wasn’t the right thing to do.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth. He ran and ran. The cold air was hitting his wounds, but he didn’t care.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry. I will take revenge on you.’</p>
<p>Living as an assassin, he may forget grace but never grudge. Keeping him alive was such a huge mistake.</p>
<p>Cort didn’t arrive at the Kronos Empire but at a certain place.</p>
<p>“No, what is that?!”</p>
<p>It was the Cairo branch of the Dante Guild. It was a group led by Dante, a high-class assassin, and they had a close relationship with Ecorche. Depending on the situation, they always helped each other out.</p>
<p>Dante’s eyes widened. Cort was a monster that even he couldn’t touch, and now he looked so weak.</p>
<p>“There is no time to explain. First, bring me a magic communicator! A magic communicator!”</p>
<p>From Dmitry to Kronos, time would run out. Thinking that running wouldn’t help, he decided to use this method to convey the information. It was the best decision. So they immediately brought it out and connected it to his guild.</p>
<p>“It isn’t connecting.”</p>
<p>“Shit!”</p>
<p>The situation was already a mess. Unless Ecorche accepted the call, it wouldn’t connect, so he called the client instead.</p>
<p>[From the looks of it, it seems like the mission has failed.]</p>
<p>Beyond the screen, Baron Charlton came into sight.</p>
<p>Cort said,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry foresaw our plan and set up a trap! All the assassins who attacked Dmitry are dead, and now Roman Dmitry is crossing the borders of Kronos to attack our base. Baron Charlton. This is your chance. If you move Kronos’s troops and send them to our guild, Roman Dmitry can be dealt with!”</p>
<p>He cried out earnestly. Yet despite Cort spitting out those words, Baron Charlton’s expression didn’t change.</p>
<p>[Is that all?]</p>
<p>At that moment, Cort went stiff. He felt an ominous feeling, and then a thought flashed through his head.</p>
<p>“…. No.”</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire—from the start, they didn’t expect Ecorche to win.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 209 - Dark Night (5)</p>
<p>Cort gritted his teeth. He wanted to scream out, but he held it back because his opponent was the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>“… You used us as bait?”</p>
<p>[Bait. Those are upsetting words. There is no such thing. You people confirmed that you would assassinate Roman Dmitry at our request for the huge reward you will get. If you had performed the mission perfectly, we would have paid the same reward which we had promised since the start.]</p>
<p>It was a fair trade. However, Baron Charlton needed things to be done in the right manner.</p>
<p>[Think again. The assassination of Roman Dmitry is something that was announced by His Majesty, the Emperor of Kronos. Everyone on the continent knows that we want Roman Dmitry’s life, and what will be the face of the empire if the assassination failed? For us, this is just a rational choice. I sincerely hoped that your guild would succeed with the mission, but the problem is that this is more important to us than placing our trust in you.]</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was not an easy person to deal with. In the process of killing Count Fabio and Gustavo, he showed how strong he was, and the empire didn’t rule out the fact that he could be a lot stronger than what he was showing.</p>
<p>Therefore, it was necessary to devise a plan thoroughly. The first part was left to the assassin guild, but the real weapon came next.</p>
<p>[I hope you understand the situation we are in. We cannot leave the matter of Kronos in the hands of an assassination guild.]</p>
<p>“… This.”</p>
<p>He wanted to curse. The claim of the opponent—he knew what it meant. However, if they had prepared a weapon for that person in the first place, then joining forces with the assassination guild would have brought more success.</p>
<p>They just used the guild as a shield. In order to save the empire, everyone went past their limits.</p>
<p>At the moment he was about to say something, blood poured out of him.</p>
<p><em>“Cough.”</em></p>
<p>He collapsed onto his knees. His face was turning pale, and his body was trembling. The liquid that Lucas fed him—it was poison. And the fact that it only took effect now meant one thing.</p>
<p>‘Did they calculate the amount of time it will take me to report on what happened in Dmitry?’</p>
<p>He was sure of it. He gave up on running and chose to use a magic communicator, but Dmitry calculated that he would do that too.</p>
<p>If he thought about it, there had been hints from Lucas all along. They wanted the world to know what would happen to anyone who touched Dmitry, and the Dante Guild would watch him die and become witnesses.</p>
<p>He felt like he was breaking down. At Baron Charlton’s words and the situation that confronted him, Cort looked at Baron Charlton with red eyes, as if they would pop out at any moment.</p>
<p>Perhaps Dmitry, whom he had faced, might have predicted this move from Kronos. He was more dangerous than they thought, but when he saw Baron Charlton here, he didn’t want to tell him the truth. He also wanted them to try.</p>
<p>His eyes widened in pain as he fell to the ground.</p>
<p>[This.]</p>
<p>Baron Charlton looked at the man with a pitiful expression.</p>
<p>Cort—it was the shabby end of an assassin who dominated an era.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was out of town. It was now time to head back to Cairo, but Roman Dmitry, who was walking, stopped.</p>
<p>“Come out.”</p>
<p>At his words, mysterious beings appeared in the darkness that leaked out.</p>
<p>“Since when did you notice our presence?”</p>
<p>It was a muffled and unpleasant voice. All of the dozens of people had black cloth wrapped around their faces. The eyes visible through them were so black that the whites could not be seen, and it was impossible to tell where they were looking.</p>
<p>They were in the back, in the front, and even in the trees. They had completely surrounded him. They lowered their stance while holding daggers in order to attack him at any moment.</p>
<p>Their behavior—in the Kronos Empire, there were forces that met the same conditions as them.</p>
<p>‘The beings that feed on the darkness of Kronos. If the Ten Swords represent the glory of Kronos, then the Three Shadows represent the ugly reality it holds. As expected, the Kronos Emperor mobilized his most dangerous power to kill me.’</p>
<p>The shadows. They had no names, yet no one denied their existence. The forces against the Kronos Empire were always attacked by the shadows, and the people who died brutally proved the existence of the shadows.</p>
<p>Actually, the existence of the Three Shadows was not that certain. In the past, there was an incident in which the shadows appeared simultaneously all over the continent, but it wasn’t exactly known how many and how strong they were.</p>
<p>And the situation ahead of him was the picture that he had expected.</p>
<p>Kronos—they were beings who wanted to be unique. The moment the emperor they worshipped like a God announced the assassination, there was no way they would fully entrust the assassination to just one organization.</p>
<p>And this wouldn’t be difficult to understand from a strong man’s point of view. If it was something that had to be successful, then he would surely send the shadows.</p>
<p>Despite that, Roman Dmitry still crossed the border. Even though he knew that they wanted him out of Dmitry’s land and that getting revenge on Ecorche wasn’t a priority, all Roman thought about was setting an example.</p>
<p>He set fire to the stronghold of the assassination guild. Bracan’s head was hung on the streets, and everyone would know what Dmitry did from the recent rumors spread by Dante. It would send a clear message.</p>
<p>If there were another assassination guild that would go against Dmitry in the future, then he wanted them to remember what would happen.</p>
<p>And now, against the Kronos Empire, it was his turn to prove what a war with him would mean. The question of when he knew about them arose, and Roman Dmitry laughed.</p>
<p>“From the start.”</p>
<p>At that moment, all the shadows rushed to him at once.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He swiftly pulled out his sword. As his shining sword slashed through the shadow, which rushed ahead, his body scattered like smoke.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>This wasn’t magic. It was an unknown, strange ability. The body of the shadow merged back to its original form, and an aura stained with darkness rose from the dagger and attacked Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>A violent feeling rose. The shadows took turns charging at him, and while blocking the attacks from all sides, Roman Dmitry looked for an opening.</p>
<p>‘Lightning.’</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>The throat of the enemy was cut. It was an absolutely unstoppable speed. If their technique of turning into smoke could be done according to their will, then they couldn’t avoid death all the time.</p>
<p>Still, the result was the same. The bodies scattered with smoke around their necks, and the black eyes of the shadows didn’t leave Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Their priority was not their own safety. Even in the attacks where ordinary people would lose their lives, they moved forward and swung their weapons at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakang!</em></p>
<p>Auras clashed. Roman Dmitry violently pushed ahead to a one-on-one fight, and the shadows fell back. Suddenly…..</p>
<p><em>Papat!</em></p>
<p>Darkness rose. It wrapped around Roman Dmitry’s body like the tentacles of a monster, but he created mana and instantly removed the darkness.</p>
<p>It was such an eerie force. It was different from the normal aura, and it had the ability to absorb power at contact.</p>
<p>Once, there were people like this in Murim. Beings that used odd abilities that were not known to many and sucked away the power of humans to make them stronger. Roman didn’t know where these shadows got their power from, but he knew that this wasn’t a normal power in this world.</p>
<p>‘The Kronos Empire. They made a compromise with evil.’</p>
<p>The Emperor. He hoped to conquer the continent. As a man who had risen to the pinnacle of power a man could have, Dmitry had no intention of criticizing the desires of that man. But the Kronos Empire crossed a line that a human being shouldn’t have crossed.</p>
<p>Their work in the Hector Kingdom. They spoiled the earth with the intention of killing their land. As a result, people began to starve to death, and the Hector Kingdom ended up choosing war to live.</p>
<p>Black magic. It was the power used at the time. If they thought that the identities of the shadows were unrelated to them, they must have had black magicians on their side.</p>
<p>History had always said that black magicians, who manifested evil powers, were beings who had given up on living like humans and that their existence itself had a bad influence on the world.</p>
<p>In the first place, wasn’t the basis of black magic based on blood and death?</p>
<p>It was clearly evil. There was evil within Kronos. However, Roman Dmitry accepted the reality in front of him. Whatever the power these shadows used and whatever the origins they had, they didn’t matter to Roman.</p>
<p>To him, who had lived a previous life, he was accustomed to evil, and he called himself the Heavenly Demon who trampled on evil.</p>
<p><em>Papat!</em></p>
<p>The shadows ran again. Their attacks disregarded their own lives. Believing that they would not die, they attacked Roman, and he raised his mana. And….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>There was an intense, bursting sound, and the bodies of the shadows were broken.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The shadows were torn. They turned into lumps of meat and were scattered on the ground. The black energies swayed, trying to connect to each other again.</p>
<p>It was a tenacious life force. Roman Dmitry stomped on them and jumped forward.</p>
<p><em>Kwakang!</em></p>
<p>During the battle, it took him some time to figure out the enemies. The shadows attacked Roman Dmitry from both sides, and after several clashes, a gleaming sword slashed their chests.</p>
<p>Smoke spread like blood. The moment the unknown forces were about to connect, his sword cut through the smoke once again, and this time it wasn’t smoke but blood.</p>
<p>The shadows were not immortal. They also couldn’t escape death, and in their successive deaths, they had to move away from Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“How did this happen?”</p>
<p>Their expressions couldn’t be seen, but their voices were those of shock. It was impossible to cut their bodies in a normal way. Even though they weren’t physically present in the first place, Roman Dmitry’s slashes were tearing their bodies apart.</p>
<p>It was a situation that they couldn’t understand despite the experiences that the shadows had had until now. They knew they couldn’t defeat Roman Dmitry at this rate.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—he was more than they had calculated. Even though the shadows didn’t send or receive signals, a strong aura of darkness rose at the same time.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>Their presence felt so strong compared to what they were showing before. It was similar to using innate qi. With a force stronger than before, Roman Dmitry faced them head on.</p>
<p>‘Each of their strengths is weaker than that of Gustavo, but in a one-on-one fight, the shadows have enough power to easily deal with Gustavo.’</p>
<p>They were strong. In his current life, he hasn’t met anyone stronger than them.</p>
<p>In this plan, crossing the border itself was risky. At the time of Roman’s plan, figures such as Chris expressed their will to follow and help him, but he refused them. Apart from his intention to prevent the guild from escaping, he wanted to face any weapon of Kronos alone.</p>
<p>The Dmitry Duchy—the area that covered the fight with Kronos was growing. Since he didn’t know Kronos’s limits, this was his chance to figure out their level of power.</p>
<p>The shadows were the best in the empire. They announced the assassination and thought the shadows would be the best solution to the problem. So he went to them, faced the enemies, and raised his sword.</p>
<p>In the past year, Roman made immense progress, and while he experienced major events, he never showed his power, nor did he need to.</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>He heightened his senses.</p>
<p>The Heavenly Demon Divine Art—in the stages of Heaven, Land, and Humans, Roman Dmitry broke down the wall and entered the stage of Land.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 210 - Dark Night (6)</p>
<p><em>Rustle.</em></p>
<p>Someone stepped onto a leaf. At first, it sounded like it was a form of conveying information, ‘stepped on a leaf,’ but as his senses were enhanced, the information his brain could process had changed.</p>
<p>The rustling sound and the moment someone’s foot touched a leaf, stepped on it, and created noise could be heard in more than one property. And that wasn’t all…</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>The wind blew. Roman Dmitry’s mana mixed with the wind, and the forms of the enemies touched by the wind were naturally processed in his head. He could see how many enemies were around him, what their bodies looked like, and even the current condition of their bodies from the sound of their breathing.</p>
<p>The Human stage was the most basic one. The foundation of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts developed the senses and paved the way for the usage of mana. And Roman Dmitry had reached the Human stage.</p>
<p>Everyone exclaimed that Roman Dmitry’s development was a leap forward, but actually, he remained on the Human stage even when he had defeated Butler. And through constant training, he broke the wall.</p>
<p>Stepping onto the stage of Land meant being one with nature, which went beyond just developing the senses of the body. His senses had become like those of a spider, which could sense everything in its web. If he accepted the nature of this, he would be one with the world.</p>
<p>One step. He moved forward. And as for the shadows, who didn’t know what this meant, they were confused.</p>
<p>In his past life, the day he first entered the Land stage, Baek Joong-hyuk blew off the heads of hundreds of warriors from the Justice Faction.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Kwaaak!</em></p>
<p>Aura rose in all directions. The shadows that manifested aura using their innate qi rushed at him even without a special signal.</p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p>The first opponent rushed at him. As he tightened his feet, his thighs swelled up, and he took in a deep breath, which created a dark aura, and Roman Dmitry noticed his opponent’s intentions.</p>
<p>The changes in the shadows spread out in succession. As if they were all communicating through telepathy, their attacks exploded in an instant.</p>
<p>It was fast. The aura of darkness went around their bodies, and it struck Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p><em>Euk.</em></p>
<p>The first attack had failed. His heightened senses grasped the information in his surroundings, and things such as the dagger moving and their muscles clenching were being relayed to his head.</p>
<p>Being assimilated with nature meant that nature that was filled with Roman’s mana made the area one with Roman. So he was able to avoid the first attack and cut off the opponent’s head at the same time.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p>A head was blown off. It was a situation that was completely incomprehensible to the shadows. Even though they used the aura of darkness, the shadows were unable to react to Roman Dmitry’s attacks. Besides, they hadn’t activated their ability to change their bodies into smoke.</p>
<p>‘The enemy’s abilities have weaknesses.’</p>
<p>The clashes from earlier gave Roman enough time to understand the abilities of his opponents. They had two weaknesses.</p>
<p>First, there was this moment when their bodies scattered like smoke and then formed into bodies again. At that time, they couldn’t perform any physical attacks. Roman Dmitry’s own attack couldn’t touch the formless smoke of the shadows, and when they were on the verge of death, red blood smoke would flow, and that was the moment he should aim to attack.</p>
<p>Second, this was a more difficult condition than the first one. The opponents were unleashing a special power, and when it was in a formless state, there was this subtle flow of mana. It was the power of the shadow’s existence.</p>
<p>Even when their bodies scattered like smoke, they could return to their original forms if there was mana, so Roman cut down the flow of mana at once to stop their bodies from linking, which meant the death of the shadows. As their bodies returned to their original forms, they were all shocked to witness a sword cut through them.</p>
<p>The power of the shadows wasn’t common. How could one attack an opponent who had left their physical body? But it wasn’t difficult for Roman, who had entered the next stage of the Heavenly Demon Divine Arts.</p>
<p>He caught the opponent’s every single movement. He had foreseen the timing of reconstructing their bodies and the flow of mana, and this time, before the opponents could link their bodies back together, he cut the flow of mana.</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>Another shadow died. At the sight of their colleagues dying, the shadows were enraged.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakang!</em></p>
<p>There was a huge shockwave from all sides as the mana rose. Everyone was ready to attack in formation. The shadows were ready to abandon their lives.</p>
<p>As the head of the advancing shadow was cut, the shadow following him cut the body of the one ahead and aimed for Roman Dmitry. It was as if the shadows had no more affection for their colleagues. Even the shadow who was cut only displayed his intent to kill Roman Dmitry and extended his sword until his last breath.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The aura of darkness exploded. As their colleagues died, their aura rose. Their auras turned out to be more powerful than Roman had thought. The shadow people were strong.</p>
<p>Gustavo, Nicholas, and Butler—even if he thought of the Continental Rankers whom he had defeated so far, they weren’t as threatening as the formation attack of these shadow people.</p>
<p>The explosions happened in all directions. If he blocked an attack from the front, another attack would come from behind, and if he blocked the sides, they would aim directly for his head from above.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>A thick cloud of dust began to rise. Since their first encounter, Roman Dmitry has brutally slashed down his enemies, who were wrapped in darkness.</p>
<p><em>Pat!</em></p>
<p>Blood splashed. Drops of dark red blood bathed all sides, and Roman’s eyes were stained red.</p>
<p>‘Blood Flow.’</p>
<p>The blood began to react as he wanted it to. The drops of blood turned into thorns and penetrated the vital organs of the shadows.</p>
<p><em>Papat!</em></p>
<p><em>Flinch.</em></p>
<p>The shadows trembled. Roman Dmitry reached out, grabbed a shadow’s head, and smashed it to the ground. That was all. The head that had been coming back to life until then went still.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s face was splashed with blood to the point where he looked like a tyrant. He utilized the Blood Flowing Arts and pierced the enemies without mercy.</p>
<p>It was the Demonic Ghost’s Martial Arts. That was how the people of the Demonic Sect used their martial arts, which only pursued strength.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry had not been actively using the martial arts of the Demonic Sect. The exact reason was that there was no need to do that, but it was also because of the visuals. The Demonic Sect didn’t care about what others thought, even if they bathed in blood and looked like scary demons. All that mattered was being strong.</p>
<p>And now, Roman Dmitry didn’t hide his skills against the Kronos Empire. Against the enemies in the darkness, Roman Dmitry created blood that could move according to his thoughts and looked like a demon.</p>
<p><em>Crush.</em></p>
<p>And he smashed the head of the enemy. It was already the tenth one. The number of enemies had been reduced significantly. They were surely strong, but Kronos’s best didn’t seem to be the solution either. The opponent had overwhelming strength.</p>
<p>Was it because the night sky was particularly dark? At some point, the shadow, who seemed to be the boss, disappeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A shadow was running through the woods. Their plan was perfect. Roman Dmitry showed warlike behavior, and as Kronos had expected, he managed to cross the borders of the estate.</p>
<p>As a result, it meant their plan was perfect until then. With Roman Dmitry coming alone, the shadows were convinced that their plan would succeed without any glitches.</p>
<p>However, they suffered one-sidedly. They couldn’t believe that Roman Dmitry was actually slaughtering the people who should have been impossible to defeat.</p>
<p>‘… Based on the reports from his previous battles, we did consider that Roman Dmitry might be a lot stronger than he had let on. That alone is amazing, but what was that form that looked like a demon? Our abilities didn’t even work against him, and we were the ones being pushed back in the battle of strength.’</p>
<p>The plan was a failure. Their advantages of mobilizing the assassination guild to reduce the number of people helping Roman, and launching a surprise attack all seemed meaningless. And finally, they were defeated in a one-on-one fight.</p>
<p>So against Roman Dmitry’s overwhelming strength, the shadow made a quick decision.</p>
<p>‘Even when the demonic humans were mobilized, we could not defeat him. Roman Dmitry is more dangerous than anything known in this world. We need to inform the empire of this fact. If even what we had just witnessed wasn’t his true strength, he would surely turn into a hurdle for the Kronos Empire’s plans.’</p>
<p>The shadows had undertaken numerous missions for the empire, and in the process, they had dealt with strong enemies. However, they had never suffered such a crushing defeat as this one, not even once.</p>
<p>The existence of those who used holy powers was outside the rankings, yet they had no choice but to give up fighting in front of them since they used the power of darkness. However, Roman Dmitry showed an entirely different result.</p>
<p>He was an enemy that they could have easily dealt with, and the situation was in their favor for a while. It was only a battle of strength, yet their powerful abilities were torn to pieces.</p>
<p>It was flustering. Undoubtedly, even the top rankers in Kronos wouldn’t be able to overcome their combined efforts like this.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry is a person who becomes more mysterious as we get to know him. If His Majesty decides to take this matter seriously and order his death, then the entire force will have to do their best against him.’</p>
<p>He ran with all his might. He was thinking of creating enough distance between himself and Roman and then contacting the empire. But just then, his body tilted.</p>
<p>At that moment, the shadow realized what had happened. His vision changed as if it were rolling around, and the two legs he was running on were surely not tired yet. However, they were now cut out.</p>
<p>The shadow just fell down, unable to do anything.</p>
<p><em>Clench!</em></p>
<p>‘… Has he already defeated the others?’</p>
<p>It was Roman Dmitry, and he had caught up with him. The plan failed. He tried to report what happened back to the empire, but he was caught.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry took out the magic communicator from his sleeve and tossed it to the shadow.</p>
<p>“Contact the Empire and report what happened.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. His intentions were unknown. There was a chance that this was a trap, but as a shadow, he had to contact the empire and tell them about the risk, so he connected it. And…</p>
<p>[Have you dealt with Roman Dmitry?]</p>
<p>Beyond the device, Baron Charlton’s voice could be heard. The shadow looked at Roman Dmitry, and said,</p>
<p>“… The plan failed.”</p>
<p>[Failed. What the hell is that supposed to mean?!]</p>
<p>“Baron Charlton. From now on, please forward my words to the Emperor. Our judgment about Roman Dmitry has been completely wrong. The eighteen shadows were not able to inflict even a single wound on Roman Dmitry, and even our ability that could cancel out physical attacks didn’t work. Roman Dmitry is hiding his power. No, maybe he hasn’t even shown a little of his strength.”</p>
<p>Roman could see and hear him report all of that. However, he didn’t stop him. Looking down, the shadow spoke,</p>
<p>“The growth of Roman Dmitry in the past two years is not normal at all. We thought we had figured out everything about him, but he still holds secrets that we cannot handle. He has to be killed. Roman Dmitry is not someone we can assess, and the empire must step in and put an end to this man.”</p>
<p>His voice intensified as if he were asking Roman Dmitry to kill him, and his role was over. If a report like that had been conveyed with a failed result, the Emperor would not just stand by.</p>
<p>At that moment, there was silence behind the other line of the communication device. Was it because he was taken aback by the report? Nothing could be heard for a while, but soon, a cold voice said,</p>
<p>[Roman Dmitry. You are there now.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 211 - Dark Night (7)</p>
<p>Having a rushed voice and panting breath, the shadow reacted as if he was conscious of someone, which meant that Roman Dmitry was there.</p>
<p>And Baron Charlton said,</p>
<p>[It is truly amazing. Attacking the stronghold of Ecorche wasn’t enough. You even dealt with the shadows, too. We admit that our plan has indeed failed. Roman Dmitry. You are more dangerous than what the public knows, and it is impossible to assassinate you by any means. Ecorche and the shadows. Mobilizing the troops would actually be better than an assassination.]</p>
<p>It was a one-sided conversation. Even without an answer coming back, Baron Charlton was certain of the other’s existence.</p>
<p>[But do not think that Kronos will give up. The Kronos Emperor wants your life, and our Emperor has never failed to get what he wants. If we fail once, we will do it twice and thrice. How long can one person live against the empire? Cairo and Dmitry cannot protect you. Being hostile against Kronos means going against a natural disaster.]</p>
<p>It was not just some verbal threat. In the past years, Kronos constantly proved its existence. Those who dared to rebel against them were trampled on, and even though people were aware of it, they just turned a blind eye. Even if they raised their voices alone, no one would help.</p>
<p>It was a powerful nation that openly spoke about its intentions to conquer the continent, so the other nations didn’t have the confidence to handle the darts of its anger. And maybe those who would stand up against them would be the first ones they would target. In addition, with the years of keeping silent over the fights that had happened once or twice, they have become more difficult to tackle.</p>
<p>Baron Charlton was having a rough time. He acknowledged Roman Dmitry, yet he believed that Roman would collapse at any time. However…</p>
<p>“Interesting.”</p>
<p>[…Interesting?]</p>
<p>“Since when did the Kronos Empire place words over actions? When the Kronos Emperor announced the assassination, there was this display of confidence that you would never fail, and now that I am alive and well, you still want to attempt an assassination in the future. Be it hiring another assassin guild or using shadows, you do what you have to do, but let me also warn you.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry grabbed the neck of the shadow. As he was strongly suppressing the struggling man, who was losing his breath, his next words followed,</p>
<p>“Somewhere in your mansion, there will be a gift from me. If I decide to assassinate you, I will use a deadly poison. Keep this in mind. You are not the only ones who can attempt an assassination, and if you want to kill me, you should act quickly by leading your troops and declaring war instead of sending assassins in the shadows.”</p>
<p>It was the first time that, even in the face of Kronos’s threat, Baron Charlton couldn’t think of anyone who raised their voice.</p>
<p>“I look forward to seeing your face once you have checked out the gift.”</p>
<p>And with that.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>The communication was cut off.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Baron Charlton turned his mansion upside down. A gift from Roman Dmitry. That meant that the security of his mansion had been breached, so the servants began to check every corner of the mansion. And as a result, they found a mysterious box in the warehouse.</p>
<p>“…There has been no outsider who has entered or left the mansion for the past week. It seems like they broke through the surveillance and left this box here.”</p>
<p>“Damn it.”</p>
<p>Baron Charlton’s stomach churned. Inside the box was a bottle of clear liquid. At first, he didn’t even touch it because he thought it was poison, so he asked the servants to return it to the box and send it to the Behemoth Magic Tower.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry talked about an assassination using poison. And if this was for that, he would have to check if the poison could be detoxified or not.</p>
<p>Behemoth was a group that mainly dealt with lethal things like poison. Due to the frequent poison experiments they conducted, they had fairly good detoxification skills.</p>
<p>And Mateo, a magician at Behemoth, opened his eyes wide as he inspected this unknown liquid.</p>
<p><em>Clink.</em></p>
<p>“A colorless, odorless poison. You brought us something bothersome.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say nonsense, and check if you can handle it.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Mateo nodded. People generally thought that detoxification magic could cure all poison, but that was a huge misunderstanding. The detoxification magic was just a part of it. In order to fully cure a deadly poison, it was important for the magician to know about the poison’s roots.</p>
<p>With such skills, the Behemoth Magic Tower was known to be the best on the continent, and at first, they even looked at this deadly poison with relaxed expressions.</p>
<p>He headed to the laboratory. After poisoning a slave, he observed the reaction. The speed of the poison’s progress was so sudden. And there were no signs of anything until the slave coughed up blood and trembled.</p>
<p>“H-Help me… <em>Cough.</em>”</p>
<p>It was immediate, and Mateo manifested magic from a distance.</p>
<p>“Cure Poison.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>A small light shone, and he inspected the body of the slave with detoxification energy and tried to prevent the poison from spreading further.</p>
<p>However, the condition of the slave didn’t improve. He had a confident expression and wasn’t nervous, as he was sincerely focused on treating the slave.</p>
<p>But soon, the slave fell. Looking at the pale corpse, Mateo wiped the sweat off his forehead.</p>
<p>“Where did you get this thing from? The poison seems so toxic that it is absolutely impossible for magicians who have just seen it for the first time to cure it. I think we need to conduct several experiments to find out how to detoxify this.”</p>
<p>“If this had poisoned me, could I have been saved?”</p>
<p>“… Honestly, I cannot speak for sure right now.”</p>
<p>Baron Charlton was shocked.</p>
<p>A poison that the Behemoth Tower couldn’t cure. Actually, it could even be considered impossible to cure, and that meant Roman had the most deadly poison with him.</p>
<p>He could see it now. It was the same as Cort’s death. If Roman Dmitry had wished to kill him, this poison would have done the job.</p>
<p>His blood went cold. As Cort coughed up blood and died, the man looked down with a smile on his face, as if he had expected it to happen. Hence, this was a matter that couldn’t be overlooked.</p>
<p>“From now on, find a way to cure this poison using any means. I understand that it will take some time, but I will not allow an answer saying that it is not possible.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Baron Charlton moved.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. The more he knew him, the more the guy seemed unusual. From now on, his priority would be to report what had happened to the Emperor.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The series of events. The Kronos Emperor, who had heard of the deadly poison, and the shadow men, who had failed, spoke with an expressionless face.</p>
<p>“There have always been people who rebelled against the Kronos Empire. However, among them, there has not been a single one who refused to bow their head after facing the Emperor head-on. Baron Charlton. What type of person do you consider Roman Dmitry to be?”</p>
<p>“…Even if you break him, I don’t think he is someone who will lower his head.”</p>
<p>“As you said. When we pressed the Cairo royal family for Roman’s arm, they opted to engage with the Kingdoms’ Alliance and confront us head-on. And now the assassination too. The assassin guild and the shadows sent a message that they could even behead the King of Cairo, but as if it wasn’t enough that they failed, Roman Dmitry showed us that he could do the same. Roman Dmitry. He would never allow a compromise with us.”</p>
<p>Throughout history, there has been no one else like Roman Dmitry. When they came out strong, didn’t history prove the end of the individuals who tried to counter them?</p>
<p>Baron Charlton went silent. Knowing what kind of person the Emperor was, he didn’t dare say any more words.</p>
<p>“In order for an empire to be an empire, not a single mistake is allowed. But now is not the time to declare war, as Roman Dmitry asked for. People think that Kronos is tolerating this because we lack the power to conquer the continent, but we know that is not true. If only one problem is solved, Kronos can accomplish great things.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry didn’t know the truth. The power they held was just a small fraction. The power of Kronos that people feared wasn’t even power.</p>
<p>Their opponent was a frog in a well. If he knew the real power of Kronos, he wouldn’t have dared rebel against the Emperor, nor would he have uttered absurd remarks about leading their troops and declaring war.</p>
<p>That was why the Emperor wasn’t angry. No matter how angry and desperate he was, Roman Dmitry was just an ant. But with that being said, there was no reason to let him live.</p>
<p>“Call the Demons from the abyss.”</p>
<p>Baron Charlton’s eyes widened.</p>
<p>The Abyssal Demons—they had a completely different existence from the shadows. Mobilizing them showed the Emperor’s will to kill Roman Dmitry at all costs.</p>
<p>“I shall do so.”</p>
<p>Baron Charlton bowed his head. In the Kronos Empire, the Emperor’s words were law, and no one was allowed to express an opinion that differed from his.</p>
<p>“A chance will come sooner or later. Show everyone what it means to be hostile to Kronos. What happens when one falls out with Kronos? As Roman Dmitry, who is praised as a hero, is torn to pieces, set up a sign where no one would ever dare to look at us again.”</p>
<p>He leaned forward. As he sat on the throne, he looked down at the nobles behind Baron Charlton. From the start until the end, the nobles, who had been watching the situation, expressed their intention to follow the Emperor’s orders blindly.</p>
<p>They were sure of it.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—as the Emperor said, he would become an example to all.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Roman Dmitry headed for the estate.</p>
<p>Baron Charlton. The deadly poison that terrified him was the embodiment of his skills from his previous life.</p>
<p>‘They would be unfamiliar with that kind of poison. Even if the power of magic is used, they cannot easily decipher it.’</p>
<p>The source of the poison was the Sichuan Tang family. They were known to possess thousands of deadly poison varieties, and they drove countless members of the Demonic Sect to death. They were a group made for killing people in huge numbers.</p>
<p>If Baek Joong-hyuk hadn’t risen to the level of becoming invulnerable to poison, his conquest of Murim would have been difficult.</p>
<p>Finally, he decapitated the Sichuan Tang family’s head, and when the Sichuan Tang family’s Lord fell, they immediately raised a white flag, and he proceeded to acquire their knowledge.</p>
<p>Even if Baron Charlton succeeded in decoding it, it didn’t matter. The deadly poison that was sent to Baron Charlton was one of their thousands of poisons, and there were many more threatening poisons that Roman could use.</p>
<p>There were some restrictions on perfectly making the poisons in this new environment, but if a war broke out, he could use the poisons to terrify the enemies.</p>
<p>Hence, he deliberately exposed one of his weapons. Since Kronos made an assassination attempt, he needed to tell them that he could do the same to them.</p>
<p>‘With this, the Kronos Empire will be moving carefully. Dmitry also has a chance of attacking back with an assassination, so they will not try to do something that will also get them killed. In the end, Kronos has the advantage, but a deadly poison without a cure is slaughter.’</p>
<p>It was a kind of intimidation. The enemy’s plan failed, so they had two options. They would try to assassinate him again, or they would kill the people around him. And Roman Dmitry prepared for the latter by using the deadly poison.</p>
<p>Since he couldn’t prepare for all the situations alone, he put a knife through his opponent’s neck to protect the people around him. It was a plan to buy time, a temporary measure. War would break out someday, so it was necessary to be fully prepared.</p>
<p>‘Kronos cannot hide their ambition any longer. It is certain that in the near future, they will declare their conquest of the continent, and from then on, I cannot stop them on my own. I need to prepare as much as possible. The only perfect solution is to win the war.’</p>
<p>The wind was bad, and he could smell blood. Dmitry was already caught up in the storm and could never get far from blood and death.</p>
<p>And once he arrived at Dmitry, there was news waiting for him before his victory was even declared.</p>
<p>“… Lord. An invitation arrived from the Valhalla Empire.”</p>
<p>The Valhalla Empire—after crossing the mountain called Kronos, another one appeared.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 212 - Dark Night (8)</p>
<p>An invitation from Valhalla. When considering the meaning of the word invitation, it seemed like a positive thing, but there was Valhalla in front of the word, and that was a different story.</p>
<p>There were two cases where the Valhalla Empire sent an invitation. It either had the pure meaning of inviting a guest and turning back when Roman declined, or it had impure intentions.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry read the invitation.</p>
<p>[Roman Dmitry. I would like to invite you as the representative warrior for the festival honoring the souls of warriors. The deadline is 100 days from now, and if you do not arrive in Valhalla on the day before that, we will consider you to have declined this invitation.]</p>
<p>Every year, the Valhalla Empire held a festival to honor the souls of warriors who died on the battlefield. On that day, the entire Valhalla would be enveloped in a festive atmosphere, and it was a unique tradition in Valhalla to select the representative warrior and see blood.</p>
<p>They believed in the superstition that the fiercer the battle, the happier the souls of the dead would become. It was a fun event. The problem was that he was confirmed to be the representative for this year.</p>
<p>Chris said,</p>
<p>“This time, the representative warrior of Valhalla is Barbossa, who is called the Twelve Swords of the Continent. For the murder of Count Denver, they would use this to display their revenge publicly.”</p>
<p>The Twelve Swords of the Continent. He was a 6-star swordsman and ranked 6th in Valhalla. He was a monster who ranked 11th on the continent, and Barbossa was the representative of the Valhalla Empire.</p>
<p>It was a time when the intentions of Kronos and Valhalla were clearly divided. Both empires equally desired revenge for one thing, but Kronos openly announced the assassination. They were the type who didn’t care about any means to get their ends.</p>
<p>If that was what Kronos did, then the Valhalla Empire chose an absurdly straightforward way to attack. If he accepted the invitation, then Roman would face Barbossa. As a result, he would die, and it would end there. However, if he won, they would forget the grudge they had against him.</p>
<p>Of course, not a single person who responded to Valhalla’s invitation survived. The representative warriors sent by Valhalla were renowned on the continent, and Valhalla was now colored in festive air as they would make their opponents fall to their swords.</p>
<p>Their intention was clear. Valhalla wanted someone to take responsibility for Count Denver’s death, and that only meant one thing—a death sentence. The moment he responded, he would die.</p>
<p>Even Chris, who trusted Roman, was worried about this.</p>
<p>“It is an invitation you don’t have to accept. Unlike two years ago, there are now many people who look at the Lord. Run away from this danger. We cannot take a risk as we did with the assassin guild.”</p>
<p>Chris’s words could be understood. However, Roman couldn’t accept the situation, so he said,</p>
<p>“An invitation is literally an invitation. As you said, there is no problem with refusing this invitation, but the Valhalla Empire values the honor of its warriors. They will think that my refusal is their victory, and they will use that to discredit my honor. The Valhalla Empire is a fox wearing the mask of a warrior. If I accept this invitation, I will face death, and if I don’t, I will receive an equal kickback. With a perfect plan, they sent me this invitation.”</p>
<p>The choice fell on Roman Dmitry. For safety reasons, it would have been right for him to refuse, but it wasn’t the best.</p>
<p>“Chris. I must make those who follow me believe in me. In the future, in order to deal with enemies that everyone thinks cannot be handled normally, I have to ensure them that I can win. And if I don’t respond to the invitation they sent, what do you think people will think of me? A single refusal that is considered a natural choice to avoid danger will cause a crack in people’s faith, and that will be the start of them breaking away. Valhalla wants Dmitry to split apart.”</p>
<p>During the past wars, Dmitry always won. At first, it was because of Roman and his skills alone, but as time went on, his own men’s skills shone. Their driving force was their trust. With a strong conviction that they could defeat any enemy if they just followed Roman Dmitry, they didn’t care about their own lives. Even if they died, they were assured that he would mourn and treat their family right, which felt more than they could ask for.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was the God of Dmitry. In the future, they knew that not betraying his trust was an important factor. Roman said,</p>
<p>“100 days later, I will accept the invitation. Chris. Just as you have your role, so do I.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Chris was speechless. He knew he would never be able to live like Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Around that time, a rumor spread among the assassination guilds.</p>
<p>“Ecorche was responsible for Roman Dmitry’s assassination, and they were massacred.”</p>
<p>The rumors began with Dante. Dante told those around him what he had seen and heard, and those rumors began to spread like wildfire.</p>
<p>“The Sword of Ecorche. When Dante met Cort after such a long time, he was shocked. Why do you think so? The well-known assassins on the Salamander Continent had been defeated and went through terrifying torture, and it is said that the people of Dmitry killed all the assassins. Cort died just like that. Dmitry brutally poisoned and released him, and Cort fell while coughing up blood. In addition, as everyone knows, Roman Dmitry crossed the border and also attacked the base of the assassin guild, as if it wasn’t just enough to kill those who attempted to assassinate him.”</p>
<p>It was a clear testimony, and the people who heard Dante’s words talked about what happened at that time. The downfall of an assassin guild—there was no one who hadn’t heard of it.</p>
<p>When people greeted the morning, they were horrified at Bracan’s head hanging on the street. It was beyond common sense. Ecorche’s failed attempt was something that could be admired and also forgotten, but taking revenge by crossing the border was hard to forget.</p>
<p>Moreover, Emperor Kronos announced the assassination. If there had been a problem in the Kronos Empire’s land, he wouldn’t have been able to return alive, yet Roman took his revenge. It sent everyone a clear message, and the people from assassin guilds trembled with fear.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry has always been consistent with his actions. When the Barco family fell, people thought that their defeat in the war was what brought them to their end, but those who knew Roman Dmitry knew that he was the one who took down Barco. That is how cruel the man is. Just like how Ecorche vanished overnight. If we plan to take any commission to assassinate Roman Dmitry or his people, we need to remember that we might be in danger.”</p>
<p>The price of the assassination—Roman Dmitry clearly displayed it. Rather than spouting nonsense or making threats, he crossed the border and showed his intentions. As a result, those who showed interest in the assassination business turned their heads. If they succeeded in what Emperor Kronos wanted, they would gain wealth and honor, but they would also have to face extinction.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, the number of requests for assassinations in the northeastern area significantly decreased. They were worried that they might pay the price for hurting people who were related to Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was right. Just one step imprinted fear in people’s hearts more clearly than a hundred words.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The downfall of the Ecorche guild—some were shocked, and some were surprised about it. If some felt fear, then Kevin, who was following Roman Dmitry, felt helpless.</p>
<p>‘…How long will I have to do nothing but just stand aside when the Lord is in danger?’</p>
<p>Today, he wanted to follow Roman. He wanted to help him since this task was dangerous, but Roman didn’t want anyone to go with him. Roman Dmitry didn’t even give them the full reason. When asked just to do their part, Kevin and the others couldn’t even say anything.</p>
<p>Everyone knew it—the fact that if they followed Roman Dmitry, they would be more of a hindrance than a help. So they suppressed their sincerity. They could only watch Roman Dmitry leave.</p>
<p>‘People say our growth was abnormally fast. However, with that alone, I cannot exist as a person suitable to follow the path my Lord would take. The Kronos Empire and the Valhalla Empire. I need to become stronger to deal with those who have been eating this continent.’</p>
<p>He went to the training ground every day. When the sun went down, he was eager to train until he was exhausted, but he knew that it would be impossible for him to grow beyond common sense just through training.</p>
<p>He needed a new method. How would he accept Roman Dmitry’s teachings, practice his martial arts, and develop higher growth?</p>
<p>All of a sudden, he remembered what Felix had said a while ago.</p>
<p>“This time, we have developed a magic circle that increases the concentration of mana in a certain area. It is not perfect yet, but it is sure to be helpful in many ways once we manage to rule out the errors. It doesn’t just increase the power of magic when used, but it can also be used for ‘training needs’ for aura swordsmen by using auras at an unusual concentration. Theoretically, aura swordsmen can increase the amount of mana they receive into their bodies and amplify their aura.”</p>
<p>It was a conversation he had with Chris. Felix was continuously conducting many experiments for the sake of Dmitry, and one of them succeeded in developing a magic circle.</p>
<p>Actually, it was something he had been researching since his stay in Frank, but he finally succeeded in pursuing it.</p>
<p>However, it was still unfinished. They said it would take half a year to make sure it would work and be safe, but Kevin didn’t have the time. So he looked for Felix. In order to become stronger, he was willing to do anything.</p>
<p>Even if he would be degraded as a test subject by the magic circle, Kevin needed a way to have noticeable results.</p>
<p>However, there were already other guests—Henderson, McBurney, and the others. Among those who followed Roman Dmitry, those who were lacking a little were there before him. In the wake of Ecorche’s case, they also had the same thought as Kevin.</p>
<p>Felix said,</p>
<p>“…Seriously, such reckless people. As you were told, this is something that hasn’t been confirmed yet, and your safety is at risk. It only has a one-in-a-million chance of success. Why would you use this for training when it could fail?”</p>
<p>“Mr. Felix. Don’t you know why we came here? The only important thing for us is to be able to help our Lord at all costs. This level isn’t enough. No matter how much we grow, the enemy we will have to deal with is the empire, which has been built up from hundreds of years of training.”</p>
<p>It was Henderson.</p>
<p>Felix could understand. He also felt helpless, so he looked at everyone and nodded.</p>
<p>“I understand. But keep this in mind, safety is my priority. Wouldn’t it be embarrassing to greet our Lord with crippled limbs when he returns? The Phoenix Magic Tower received so much help and money from the Lord, so I can never deliver bad news to him.”</p>
<p>They also knew it. They couldn’t expect any major changes here. But still, they chose to move forward.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The night after, at the iron mines in Dmitry, a sudden accident occurred when a new site was being dug up.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>“The path is collapsing!”</p>
<p>“Avoid it!”</p>
<p>The tunnel collapsed. The entire place had been thoroughly checked to see if the ground was solid, but the accident was very sudden.</p>
<p>Everyone quickly evacuated. In the past, these mines had claimed the lives of many, but with the newly installed devices, the people could be protected.</p>
<p>[Air Shield]</p>
<p><em>Wheik—</em></p>
<p>The wind rose. An intangible barrier formed, preventing things from collapsing from above. Thanks to that, the people were able to secure time to escape.</p>
<p>After a long time had passed and the ground had stabilized, Morkan, who checked the tunnel, noticed something.</p>
<p>“… What the?”</p>
<p>Deep underground, a hole was drilled, and at the bottom, an underground passage was formed, which seemed to have been made by human hands.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 213 - Secret Hidden Underground (1)</p>
<p>It was a day unlike any other. Roman Dmitry, who was training alone, received a report from Hans that they found something in the iron mines.</p>
<p>‘There is an artificially made passage. It is impossible for someone to make that.’</p>
<p>The underground of the iron mines. They were working on drilling tunnels to secure an artificial road. It was to make the land, which was tightly packed with soil and stones, into a form suitable for work, but it did not make sense that it had an artificially made passage below it.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, it wasn’t a place that allowed human access at all. Then how did it happen? How did someone make an underground passage, and what was its purpose?</p>
<p>Perhaps, there was a chance that it was a dungeon. According to history, magicians made their own places in spaces that no one could touch.</p>
<p>And so, they arrived near the mine. It was a place where they had to cross mountains, and he followed Morkan’s guidance and saw it.</p>
<p>“Here.”</p>
<p>There was an underground passage. It was definitely artificial. After moving along the place for a long time, a sight that put an end to the belief that a human’s hands had made it unfolded.</p>
<p>“You have no idea how flustered I was when I saw this. When I first investigated the ground for minework, I obviously didn’t notice that there was this much space. However, as a shaft was drilled, this empty space began to appear, which caused a collapse. Who made this?”</p>
<p>There was a huge door. At the end of the passage, there was a steel door blocking the way. It wasn’t just plain steel. It was made of steel with patterns imprinted on it, and the existence of the door proved that people could come and go through this place.</p>
<p>And for Roman Dmitry, it wasn’t something that could be overlooked. The endless mountain ranges were an important place on Dmitry’s map, and he had to find out what was there.</p>
<p>“Call Felix.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>He could raise his aura and cut it down, but in preparation for a magic trap, he wanted Felix to open it.</p>
<p>And before long, Felix arrived. Felix immediately inspected the door and came to a quick conclusion.</p>
<p>“The entire steel door has magic energy in it. If we try to force it open, there is a high chance that there will be a mana explosion that will cause this place to collapse. First of all, I will use mana to eliminate the possibility of an explosion.”</p>
<p>It was the beginning of a tedious task. For three days, Felix clung to the steel door and drained its mana. It was a tough task that even skilled people wouldn’t dare do, and he was drenched in sweat as he worked nonstop.</p>
<p>And when three days passed like that, Felix managed to open the door in front of Roman.</p>
<p>“…The door is open!”</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>Mana raged, and everyone’s eyes were focused on the aura of mana that spread through the steel door.</p>
<p><em>Creeeaaak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened, and it was then, as Felix was about to check the other side in excitement, that a violent hand grabbed him by the back and threw him against the wall.</p>
<p>That shock was short-lived. When Felix raised his head to confirm who it was, it was Roman who jumped ahead and blocked the path where Felix had previously stood.</p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p>Dozens of arrows hit Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Beyond the door, he had noticed the existence of the arrows. Roman Dmitry quickly reacted by sending Felix back and blocking the arrows with a Sword Shield.</p>
<p><em>Tatak.</em></p>
<p>The arrows fell to the ground, and Felix was shocked as he grasped the situation.</p>
<p>“It seems like a dungeon with traps installed.”</p>
<p>Felix was unable to react just now. The arrows were so threatening that he couldn’t sense them with his magic, which meant that even normal humans wouldn’t be able to survive in this place.</p>
<p>It was an odd situation. There was a trap that fired arrows as soon as the door was opened, as the mana that contained the energy of the explosion would detect it and get activated.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“From now on, I will check inside.”</p>
<p>“Dangerous! It is dangerous! There are traps lurking around the place! Even if it takes time, I think it would be better to grasp the existence of the traps fully.”</p>
<p>“No. If there are creatures living here, there is a high chance that they were aware of our existence the moment the door opened. The longer we delay it, the greater the risk we put ourselves at. Wait here.”</p>
<p>And he took a step. A decision was made, and everyone agreed that it was the best, even if it was risky.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He stepped through the door. He heightened his senses and prepared for unexpected attacks.</p>
<p>And after only ten steps, just shortly after entering, the wall cracked, and weapons equipped with arrows appeared.</p>
<p><em>Papak!</em></p>
<p>It was a surprise attack. Hundreds of arrows were fired from all sides, but Roman Dmitry blocked all of them with a Sword Shield.</p>
<p>Then the other traps started. Arrows would come flying with every step he took, and in some parts, the ground suddenly sank, revealing sharp spears. And…</p>
<p>‘…Poison?’</p>
<p>A weird gas was released. It was a lethal poison that normal humans would die from, but Roman, who ended up being touched by it, just raised his mana to detoxify it. It was because Roman Dmitry had experienced the poison of the Sichuan Tang family.</p>
<p>The existence that created the underground seemed to have prepared a lot. However, none of the traps worked because the wrong opponent stepped through them.</p>
<p>And this made it clear. The one who made this place, despite making a passage, didn’t want others to enter it.</p>
<p>‘This is how the passage of the Zhuge family was.’</p>
<p>They were one of the Five Great Families of the Forces of Justice. If the Sichuan Tang family made poison, then the Zhuge family drove the Demonic Sect into a corner with their brilliant strategies and traps.</p>
<p>At that time, even Baek Joong-hyuk’s forces had a hard time. Although the Zhuge family were geniuses, there was no way they could handle more force than they had planned.</p>
<p>At last, for the trap to work, there had to be room for the trap to open. Roman Dmitry didn’t allow that, and in an instant, he broke through the underground traps.</p>
<p>The end was finally in sight. There was a space leading to the end of the path, and suddenly, a human’s voice was heard.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>It was a thick, angry voice, but it was as he had expected. Beneath the endless mountain ranges, there was life.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The owner of the voice said,</p>
<p>“This is our land. If you come any closer, I can assure you that your life cannot be saved.”</p>
<p>It was a rough voice. The unknown being was seething with hostility.</p>
<p>If it were a normal situation, Roman Dmitry would have stepped back, but the fact that this was an endless mountain range was the problem.</p>
<p>“I am Roman Dmitry of the Dmitry family. The endless mountains belong to the Dmitry estate, and we found an underground passage while we were developing an iron mine. Reveal your identity and your purpose. If you can’t give an explanation, we cannot just stand by since this is a threat to Dmitry.”</p>
<p>The endless mountains were Dmitry’s safety net. Foreign invasion wasn’t allowed in this place, and Roman Dmitry formed the last bastion for Dmitry in these mountains.</p>
<p>After creating an environment like the Ten Thousand Mountains, farming would develop on the plains of the mountains, and if time passed, Dmitry would become self-sufficient.</p>
<p>However, what if there were creatures unrelated to Dmitry in this supposedly safe place? Their unpredictable movements would bring trouble to Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Nonsense! We have no reason to talk to you!”</p>
<p>“That is not a matter for you to decide. On the continent, the endless mountain ranges in Cairo’s land are what Dmitry inherited. I am not trying to negotiate with you. Should I get rid of the beings who formed a home on Dmitry’s land, or should I acknowledge your right to live? Think about it. If you stick with your current attitude, the situation will not get any better.”</p>
<p><em>Shhhiiing.</em></p>
<p>He drew his sword, and beyond the space, he heard the sound of hurried movement. However, their form in contact with mana was slightly different from that of normal humans.</p>
<p>It was then….</p>
<p>“Damned humans! Do not force your damned human laws on us!”</p>
<p>With an angry voice, the owner of the voice appeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Short in height, an oddly tough body, and a bushy beard. Their physical features indicated….</p>
<p>‘…Dwarf?’</p>
<p>He was sure of it. They were of another race. They were a race of people who were said to have been blessed with crafts and had similar physical bodies to humans but were different at the same time.</p>
<p>Actually, their race wasn’t something legendary. They weren’t common, but they existed on the continent, and it was said that the dark elves could be heard in the southern jungles, while the voices of sirens could be heard on the nameless islands across the sea.</p>
<p>Occasionally, these races would appear on the slave market. Buying them was expensive, and in the case of dwarves, they were usually sold to smithies.</p>
<p>And the dwarf said,</p>
<p>“It is none of our business how humans divide their lands. We have been here underground for ages, and that is a fact no one can deny. Did you call yourself Roman Dmitry? I have lived for two hundred and eighty years. Even when I was born on this land and received the blessings of my people, humans never showed up here. On what grounds do you claim this land as yours?!”</p>
<p>His voice was full of hostility. The other races hated humans. In the past, there were records that they lived in harmony with humans, but the greed of some people who enslaved them led to their relationship’s ruin.</p>
<p>Now, the emotions that have been passed down from generation to generation are deeply embedded in their bones. So the dwarf couldn’t accept Roman because he was a human.</p>
<p>‘His hand is shaking.’</p>
<p>The hand of the dwarf that was holding the axe was trembling, as were the others too. Seeing how he had destroyed their perfect trap, they seemed to realize that he was an enemy they couldn’t handle with their own strength.</p>
<p>Even so, he showed his face and raised his voice. If he didn’t do that, then their race’s lives wouldn’t be guaranteed now.</p>
<p>‘A different race that exists in the mountains. How do I deal with them?’</p>
<p>That was the problem. The division of races was not the issue. Roman Dmitry was more worried about the fact that they existed here than the fact that they were dwarves.</p>
<p>As he said, the ownership of the mountain ranges couldn’t be claimed by the humans alone. But if they had the ability to endanger Dmitry, the words they uttered wouldn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>Remove the risk factor—that was the commander’s job. Roman Dmitry was willing to shed blood if he had to.</p>
<p>“As you said, this might be your land, not Dmitry’s. However, what I need is reassurance that your existence doesn’t pose any threat to Dmitry. The endless mountains meet Dmitry’s land. Just as we have set foot on your land, it means that you exist at a distance close enough to set foot in ours. So give me the confidence. The reason why I don’t have to be hostile to you. The confidence that coexisting with you is safe. If not, we will be forced to make a decision.”</p>
<p>It was a complex matter. Unlike Kronos, who wanted to conquer the continent, Dmitry and the dwarves depended on each other to survive.</p>
<p>If that was skipped over, could they go back to ignoring each other’s existence like in the past?</p>
<p>It wasn’t possible. The miners of the iron mines would know about the existence of the dwarves, and either way, each side would be nervous about the other. And from then on, disputes would happen.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry, who had reigned as the Heavenly Demon, had seen such troubles pop up countless times, so he wanted to clear up any misunderstanding immediately. As if part of the endless mountain ranges were their land, the other part was Dmitry’s.</p>
<p>Dmitry’s history had proven it, and this time, the issue had nothing to do with divisions.</p>
<p>“Are you sure? How can we be sure of that?!”</p>
<p>The dwarf was a bit taken aback. He didn’t want war, but Roman’s answer also didn’t seem right.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that the dwarf, who was still thinking, saw Roman Dmitry’s sword. At that moment, his eyes shone. Even knowing that he shouldn’t act like that in such a situation, he was immersed in the sword.</p>
<p>“… Can I take a look at the sword?”</p>
<p>It was a question that didn’t fit the situation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 214 - Secret Hidden Underground (2)</p>
<p>Dwarves. From the moment they took their first step, they held a hammer and lived their entire lives in front of the flames.</p>
<p>He had heard of the rumors. They showed a fanatical obsession with everything that was made in the forge, and they showed infinite respect for works of art. Their instinct didn’t discriminate between the time and place for it. Even in the current situation where their estate was being claimed, the dwarf’s body and mind were different.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s sword was spectacular. The dwarf couldn’t come to his senses as he looked at the sword that was shining in his eyes.</p>
<p>“…It sounds insane for me to ask you to look at your sword when I was yelling just now, but just a minute. No, three minutes! Can you show me your sword just once? If you grant me that request, I will consider the compromise with Dmitry in a positive light.”</p>
<p>His voice became muffled, and Roman Dmitry stared at his opponent. Giving his sword to an opponent he wasn’t familiar with wasn’t right, but he could see the desire in the eyes of the dwarf. It looked like the eyes of a child.</p>
<p>The artisans whom Roman had met always had the same eyes when they looked at art. It was a familiar reaction, and he knew that there wouldn’t be any problem if he handed him the sword.</p>
<p>Around 30 meters. He checked that distance through his senses. There were several dwarves beyond his vision, and the information about their movements was made clear in his head.</p>
<p>One in a million. He was confident he could block any variables. In addition, with Roman Dmitry’s experience, he was convinced that if he showed them his sword, it would give him the chance to advance a new relationship with the dwarves.</p>
<p>‘The dwarves don’t hold any grudges against Dmitry. Then there is no reason for me to be so on guard.’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry wasn’t a murderer. He was only cruel when he needed to be, and he would only take down any relationships that couldn’t be made.</p>
<p>“Take my sword.”</p>
<p>At that point, the dwarf responded with different emotions. At first, he reacted cautiously because he didn’t trust Roman, but then he soon accepted the sword with trembling hands. It looked like he would burst into tears any minute.</p>
<p>As he examined every nook and cranny of the sword, he could not hide his admiration.</p>
<p>“… There is a sword like this?”</p>
<p>The strength of the sword and its shape were all perfect. However, that alone couldn’t be called art in the world of the dwarves, but Roman Dmitry’s sword showed the nature of accepting the energy of nature, which was why it was truly miraculous.</p>
<p>The dwarves have always wanted to make a sword that could transcend the realm of just being an object, and the sword in front of him seemed to be the answer to that.</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>His heart pounded. As if he were handling a child, he held the sword very carefully.</p>
<p>“Who made this sword?”</p>
<p>He could think of a couple of figures. It was impossible with the current level of humans, and he thought that a few ancestors of the dwarves could have created this.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a conclusion based on prejudice. With the skills humans have had for the last hundred years or so, there wasn’t any news about such a thing being made. However…</p>
<p>“I made it.”</p>
<p>“…Are you telling the truth?”</p>
<p>The eyes of the dwarf trembled. He couldn’t believe it—to think that the person in front of him had created such a thing.</p>
<p>He looked at the sword again. No matter how much he thought about it, hearing that unbelievable fact made him caress the sword and close his eyes.</p>
<p>The memory of the sword—he read the process of how it was made. It was a special ability that only the dwarves had, and as the space around him changed, the surroundings turned into a workshop.</p>
<p>Everything in the underground completely vanished. The dwarf plunged into the moment the sword was born, and at the same time, flames spewed out, and Roman Dmitry’s figure appeared.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeik.</em></p>
<p><em>Kang! Kang!</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was pounding on the steel. His upper body was unclothed, and his gaze on the sword showed how committed he was.</p>
<p>It was admirable. Roman Dmitry was clearly a craftsman. He wasn’t just an ordinary human. He was of the same kind as them. It was then…</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>The flame roared. The flames of the furnace shook and wrapped themselves around Roman, and the dwarf almost screamed at the intense sight, forgetting it was just a memory.</p>
<p>It was dangerous. The fire was a force that even the dwarves would handle with care, and it was clear that the human body was a lot weaker than theirs.</p>
<p>However, the situation he was worried about didn’t happen. The flames didn’t do anything. Roman Dmitry accepted the flames around his body, and rather, he continued to hit the steel.</p>
<p>“Ahhh….!”</p>
<p>The dwarf was shocked. Roman Dmitry’s appearance made him look like he was an incarnation of fire. Before he realized it, tears flowed down his face, and the memories of the sword ended.</p>
<p>The emotional afterglow didn’t vanish. The dwarf looked at Roman with completely different eyes than before and said,</p>
<p>“If it is you, it might be possible. Please handle our land.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His attitude changed. The dwarf, who had been yelling at him not to get closer, now treated Roman like a noble.</p>
<p>“You want your land to be handled? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry also decided to show respect to his opponent.</p>
<p>The dwarf calmed down and spoke.</p>
<p>“Before I speak of my request, you should know why the dwarves migrated down to this place. In fact, the Endless Mountains is a name given by humans. Contrary to what humans think, there is an end to the Endless Mountains. Arcadie. That is what we call what is beyond the Endless Mountains, and it is a harmonious world where all races live.”</p>
<p>Beyond the mountains, a new world opened up. Various forms of life lived there, as did other races like elves and dwarves. If the incident that plunged the different races into despair hadn’t happened, then the dwarves wouldn’t have set foot in this place.</p>
<p>“A very long time ago. At a time when the human world wasn’t as developed as it is now, an unknown cold wave broke out across the mountain ranges. As a result, the ground froze, and even the World Tree, which was the foundation for this world, withered. That was the start of the disaster. The elves guarding the World Tree tried their best to save it, but no matter what they did, they couldn’t revert it back to its original form. At that time, many races died. The different races that promised to live in Arcadie until the end died from the cold and hunger, and the ancestors of the dwarves at the time couldn’t help but make a decision for the survival of our race. And so, we came here and settled in this place.”</p>
<p>It was a long time ago. It was such a long time ago that it couldn’t even be given a date. And the reason why the dwarf explained what happened beyond the Endless Mountains was that it had something to do with the main point he was going to talk about.</p>
<p>“About several decades ago. We found a mass of fire demons deep underground. It has such a dangerous power that it could burn down the whole world, but if used correctly, it is also the only hope of melting the World Tree. Roman Dmitry. I have only met you for the first time today. But at a time when we cannot even dare approach the fire, I believe that it is God’s will for me to meet you, who can freely handle the flames. I beg you. Please bring me the Fire Demon. If you can make this request, I will do anything in the name of ‘Brown Rock,’ who leads the dwarves.”</p>
<p>The relationship that started with angry words is now entering a new phase.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Brown Rock. When the dwarves were born, they used the surrounding nature to catch the eye of their mother so they could be given a name. In a world where only brown rocks were present, the new leader of the dwarves turned into a symbol representing the Dark Ages.</p>
<p>And at his request, Roman Dmitry was lost in thought.</p>
<p>‘Do I need to help them?’</p>
<p>This fire. It could be a dangerous force. It would be different from the normal fire that he handles, and the request could cost him his life. The reward he spoke of also meant nothing.</p>
<p>The relationship with the dwarves could be somehow solved, and there was no reason to give them what they wanted. In addition, they could be using him as collateral.</p>
<p>But Roman Dmitry felt a strong pull towards them. He thought that the series of events that happened could be his fate.</p>
<p>‘This life is not the life I hoped for. I accepted death, and when I opened my eyes, I was existing as a person called Roman Dmitry. At first, I didn’t think it was fate guiding me. Dmitry’s fool wasn’t great enough to talk about things like fate. I lived in the reality he made.’</p>
<p>One day, and then two days. Time passed, and the things he had experienced until now began to form a link before he realized it.</p>
<p>‘Living as Roman Dmitry, was it a coincidence that I met similar people in the past? Dmitry came from a family of blacksmiths, which isn’t common, and the Endless Mountains are like the Hundred Thousand Mountains of the Heavenly Demon Sect. I am walking down the same path as in the past, but I am also taking a different path at the same time. My experience in the past is helping me with my current one.’</p>
<p>And he found the dwarves in the Endless Mountains. They admired his sword and his ability to handle fire, which made him their savior.</p>
<p>This was fate. If he wasn’t born as Roman Dmitry, he wouldn’t have gotten this chance. If the development of the iron mines hadn’t occurred, this wouldn’t have happened. If he wasn’t someone who could handle the Infernal Flame Arts, he wouldn’t be asked to fulfill this request.</p>
<p>The moment any of those conditions weren’t met, this situation wouldn’t have happened at all.</p>
<p>‘I have just entered the next level. If accepting the fire is an ordeal too difficult for me to handle, I will be guided by nature. And for me to meet the dwarves only after stepping to a higher level, can all of this really be discarded as a simple coincidence? Isn’t there a clear reason why I, who had lived in Murim and had nothing in relation to this world, was given this life?’</p>
<p>These questions had no answers. Heavenly Demon Baek Joong-hyuk—he lived by cursing fate. As he struggled at the bottom of life, he cursed God numerous times for letting him be born.</p>
<p>However, it was different now. Life gave everyone tests, and it was Baek Joong-hyuk’s choices that made him the Heavenly Demon and helped him overcome all troubles.</p>
<p>The beings who died for him. Because of their fate, they couldn’t find a way out and continuously fought and aimed for the lives of others.</p>
<p>Fate. He believed in it. Each person had their own reality, but he didn’t think that it determined everything. So…</p>
<p>‘Let’s find out what brought me to this place.’</p>
<p>Without considering the relationship with the dwarves, this was a decision he had to make for himself.</p>
<p>“I will accept the request.”</p>
<p>The reply came after silence, and Brown Rock looked like he had won the world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They took a step to the bottommost place. They went all the way down. The growing heat wasn’t a natural one, and at some point, Brown Rock stopped and said,</p>
<p>“From now on, this is an area we cannot enter. The fire in there is dangerous. Please take care of yourself. If you can give us a clue to save the World Tree, we will consider you our lifelong benefactor.”</p>
<p>Their words weren’t a major issue. As he was focusing, he stepped inside, and after moving for a while, he saw something unbelievable.</p>
<p>At the center of that place, a fire was raging. It was like a small sun, and it felt like directly looking at it would make people blind.</p>
<p>‘Whatever has brought me here, I will live for the things I believe and follow them.’</p>
<p>He approached the Fire Demon. As he faced the flaming heat, he brought out his hand. At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik!</em></p>
<p>A tremendous heat engulfed Roman Dmitry’s body.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 215 - Secret Hidden Underground (3)</p>
<p>The heat was too strong. As the flames engulfed his body, Roman felt like the flames were sucking him inside, and the heat was burning him down.</p>
<p>‘This is bad.’</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeik.</em></p>
<p>He was out of breath. The flames were so hot and roaring brightly that they blinded him, and the state of invulnerability that he had to cold and heat had no effect. Terrible pain radiated in every part of his body that was touched by the flames. The cold energy did block the heat to some extent, but the flames of this Fire Demon were so different from normal flames.</p>
<p>This was infernal. However, he had already expected it. If this was something that could melt the frozen World Tree, then he knew that controlling it wouldn’t be easy.</p>
<p>‘Infernal Fire Arts.’</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>He began to raise his mana. The energy in his dantian began to circulate around his body to push out the flames. A massive explosion erupted from within him. Every time his mana and the flames collided, Roman Dmitry’s face would turn red, and his skin would crack. And the moment he got pushed back even once, he knew that the situation would be irreversible. The fire he was facing now wasn’t something he had faced before.</p>
<p>‘The only way to fight the fire that is around me is to accept it. As if the flames are being controlled by the Infernal Fire Arts, I will embrace them slowly. Even if the heat burns down my skin and pushes me into unbearable pain, I need to become one with it.’</p>
<p><em>Wheeik.</em></p>
<p>The fire intensified. As Roman Dmitry drew his breath and embraced the flames, the flames of the Fire Demon burned as if in rage. It seemed like he understood why the dwarves didn’t want to touch it. The mass that was tightly packed with fire showed how savage it would be if someone got close to it.</p>
<p>His skin was melting. Parts of his body that couldn’t handle the heat began to fall to the ground, causing him unimaginable pain.</p>
<p>But still, Roman Dmitry didn’t step back. Living a life of struggle and suffering, he accepted that as his reality, and his body didn’t escape the control of his mind under any circumstances. He had the strongest control. It was a firmer force than the pain of the flames.</p>
<p>The flames of the Fire Demon tried to break his mind by pushing him through pain, but Roman’s head was as calm as a ship in a typhoon.</p>
<p>‘Now.’</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>He opened all his senses to the fullest and accepted the fire.</p>
<p>The Human Stage. Once his body was suitable for nature, he would become one with nature through the stage of intellect.</p>
<p>Also, the flames of the Fire Demon were a part of nature. The fire was surely chaotic, yet it was the most basic force, and Roman Dmitry’s intention was to assimilate with the fire that caused pain to his body.</p>
<p>And from then on, his skin began to regenerate at the same pace as it was melting. While burning, his body continued to restructure itself, and the skin that had melted was regenerating.</p>
<p>If he hadn’t taken a step higher before coming here, this fire would have eaten him alive. It was Roman’s fate to come here and meet the Fire Demon that appeared in this place. Wouldn’t accepting the flames be what the being that had brought him to the Salamander Continent also wished for?</p>
<p>Then what was the purpose that this fire had? He had never made a choice against his will as he lived as Roman Dmitry, and that would still continue to be the case.</p>
<p>Protecting the land and becoming strong—that was it. As for the issue related to the World Tree, he took the risk because their interests aligned.</p>
<p>‘If the path I am moving on and the purpose that my destiny desires are the same, it isn’t the result of fate but a life created from my choices. I thought it was fate that had led me to this flame, and I accepted the pain on my own terms.’</p>
<p><em>Wheeik.</em></p>
<p>The fire roared. In the heat that burned fiercely as if it was going to destroy him, Roman Dmitry withstood the pain.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>Wind rose. The flames that were sticking to his skin began to get pushed back, and Roman’s skin quickly regenerated. As it returned to its original form, the flames could no longer burn Roman’s body.</p>
<p>At that moment, Roman Dmitry’s consciousness had fallen somewhere beyond the world.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The Salamander Continent. The beginning of this world that the people lived in came from flames.</p>
<p>Salamander appeared in the world, and it coughed up a fire that was strong enough to burn everything, and what crumbled from that ended up as the foundation of this continent.</p>
<p>People accepted that as a legend and orally spoke about it to each generation, but the person who first spoke of that said he didn’t know the full truth.</p>
<p>A world made from fire. Roman Dmitry plunged into the source, and when he opened his eyes, there was fire everywhere, and it burned everything red.</p>
<p>[He who has received the blessing of flames. Accept me. My Heavenly Order is tied to you with a link.]</p>
<p>A voice echoed through the space. The flame was shining everywhere, expressing its presence. The power that the Fire Demon held was amazing.</p>
<p>Just as Felix manifested the power to burn the world by summoning the fire spirit, if he accepted this, he would be able to enter an entirely different level than before.</p>
<p>But Roman Dmitry didn’t accept the devil’s words. Looking at the Fire Demon, who spoke sweet words by mentioning the Heavenly Order, he showed unwavering eyes.</p>
<p>“I do not care who you are. If you want to join me, you will follow me.”</p>
<p>Fate and order, or words that spoke of such an irresistible connection. Roman Dmitry wanted to hold this power. The Fire Demon told him that if he wanted to accept this power, it wanted the human to be under its control.</p>
<p>That was the life of Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon. Even when he fell to the coldest bottom, even when he was forced to go through trials because he was the son of the Heavenly Demon, he always broke the chain of fate and rose to the top.</p>
<p>Always. The initiative of life was in him. The cruel reality may have been driven by fate, but it was one’s willingness that made it happen.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>The flames distorted, and then came a laugh.</p>
<p>[Such an incredible answer.]</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>There was an explosion. The fire covered the land, and Roman Dmitry’s existence was swept away by it.</p>
<p>Even at the moment when everything was vanishing, Roman’s spirit remained intact, and he watched the process of being pulled into the fire.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When he opened his eyes, his throat felt dry. When he raised his body a little with a frowning expression, the first thing he saw was someone who looked like Brown Rock.</p>
<p>“… You really succeeded.”</p>
<p>It was Brown Rock. He looked thrilled. The dwarves found the Fire Demon that could save the World Tree by chance, but they couldn’t touch it because they would die, so they had to bite down on their anger.</p>
<p>And from beyond the Endless Mountains, there was a world that Brown Rock’s generation had never experienced but that their blood had longed for. And at the thought that someone from there could finally save the tree, he couldn’t hide his emotions.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>“Take this.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry handed him something. It was the Fire Demon. It was like a crystal. It was a small, reddish bead that contained a burning flame inside that was enough to make one feel warm at the touch of it.</p>
<p>The dwarf who touched it trembled. Actually, they thought that the human would be greedy, but he kept his promise.</p>
<p>Humans—they didn’t like them. Their ancestors’ experiences of the greed of humans were passed down to them as lore. However, Roman Dmitry was different.</p>
<p>Brown Rock, who led the dwarves, remembered the benefit they got from the man.</p>
<p>“While Roman Dmitry was fighting with those flames, I had a few conversations with Dmitry’s people. I heard that Dmitry is a city blessed with people who are blacksmiths. In return for this, apart from the favor that Roman Dmitry is asking, we, the dwarf race, will devote ourselves to the Dmitry family from now on. We will pass on our blacksmith skills for the development of your people, and we will build a solid wall so that no one can invade Dmitry. If needed, we will even prepare weapons to arm your soldiers.”</p>
<p>His voice trembled. He was expressing his gratitude.</p>
<p>“The elves who occasionally bring us news said this to me. The cold wave in Arcadie is getting worse with each day, and now the life of the World Tree has reached its limit. We are on the verge of losing our home. If it weren’t for Mr. Roman’s help, we would have given up.”</p>
<p>He was crying. For the last 280 years, he has lived in this underground. Their ancestors said that the dwarves had a home in the vast lands, but Brown Rock had never seen them.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He didn’t know this human, but he gave him hope. Brown Rock didn’t think of Roman Dmitry as a passing relationship.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“That is enough. Dmitry will never be against you.”</p>
<p>A reason to trust and a reason not to be hostile—Brown Rock’s eyes were proof of them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The case was settled. The development of the iron mines had been halted, but the blacksmiths were rather excited to have a close relationship with the dwarves.</p>
<p>The skills of the dwarves—wasn’t it the dream of all blacksmiths to learn from them?</p>
<p>And on that day, Roman Dmitry stood alone in the training hall. He raised his sword and created aura, and the energy of flames sparked.</p>
<p>‘The flames of the Fire Demon have settled inside my dantian.’</p>
<p>In the world he was in when it happened, he knew the Fire Demon was real. The process of accepting it was now a reality, and Roman Dmiry felt his dantian burn. The crystals that he had given to Brown Rock were just a part of it.</p>
<p>However, with that alone, the purpose that Brown Rock had wanted him to fulfill was over. At his will, the flames roared. It was unlike magic, and it had the power to manipulate fire.</p>
<p>‘I need to think about how to use this in the future.’</p>
<p>What was certain was that he had taken a great stride this time.</p>
<p>‘The reconstruction of my body by itself had to be the main thing.’</p>
<p>Lately, he has taken a step into a new stage. However, due to an unintentional change in his training, he was able to step up to a higher level than before. It was a growth rate that was overwhelming, even compared to his previous life.</p>
<p>In his past life, it took him a considerable amount of time to reach that level, but in this life, he shortened it by a shocking amount of time. For now, he had to check his strength and see how much he had changed.</p>
<p>What was the power of this flame? In order to defeat his opponents in the future, he had to figure out how far he could go.</p>
<p>He took a step.</p>
<p>The shadows, the assassins of Ecorche, and the Fire Demon. Even after experiencing such a series of events, Roman didn’t take a rest and headed to the workshop, where people weren’t allowed to enter. And just like that…</p>
<p><em>Kik.</em></p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>For his closed-room training, he disappeared into the darkness.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>One month later, Hans headed to where Roman Dmitry was training.</p>
<p>‘He said he would be back in one month.’</p>
<p>He walked hurriedly. A few days ago, a guest arrived looking for Roman. Of course, Hans told the person to come back again as he was now in closed-room training, but the guest was so stubborn that several days had already passed since he stayed in Dmitry.</p>
<p>So for that person’s sake, he had to bring Roman to him. When he arrived at the workshop, he found Roman, who had already come out of the door.</p>
<p>“Young Master. Did you finish your training?”</p>
<p>“Thankfully, I was able to focus on my training. While I was gone, were there any special problems?”</p>
<p>“There was a guest who came looking for you. Please go there at once. He has been waiting for the Young Master for several days.”</p>
<p>He did call that person a guest, but it felt odd. Hans’s reaction meant that he was a new face. So he headed to the guest room.</p>
<p>And the person who was waiting there impatiently got up with a bright face at the sight of Roman.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I am Count London of Redford.”</p>
<p>Count London. He was a 1st-degree assassination target on Ecorche’s list. He was the guest who came for Roman.</p>
<p>And at the same time, Hans, who went to clean up the place where Roman had been training, opened his mouth wide at the charred place.</p>
<p>It was a sight that couldn’t be explained unless one was in a place that had been burned. He couldn’t understand just what had happened in this place.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 216 - Count London (1)</p>
<p>A week ago, Count London heard devastating news.</p>
<p>“…. The Golden Bank has sent an ultimatum. A fortnight later, if we don’t pay the 100,000 gold back, they will exercise their rights as creditors and make a formal complaint against us. What do we do? As you know, the Redford treasury doesn’t have that amount right now to clear up the debt. In a situation where the operating expenses for next year also have to be covered by loans from outside, the nation will collapse if we give up 100,000 gold.”</p>
<p>100,000 gold—that was a lot of money, but it was not an amount at which the nation would entirely collapse. The problem was the situation Redford was in. Due to the King’s carelessness in dealing with his gambling addiction, the treasury dried up, and the debt that had accumulated now couldn’t be handled.</p>
<p>Belatedly, they raised their hands to control the King. But then they realized the reality of the debt on their heads that had snowballed.</p>
<p>Count London said,</p>
<p>“Is there any room for negotiation?”</p>
<p>“About that. At the Golden Bank, they said they want everything in any form, be it land or money.”</p>
<p><em>“…Phew.“</em></p>
<p>He sighed. During the last few years, Count London has worked tirelessly to save the nation. In the process, he lost a lot of land, but the nation still had many problems that needed to be solved.</p>
<p>The debt of 100,000 gold wasn’t something he could pay. To be precise, even if he gave up all of his fortunes now, Redford would face the same problem in the future. It was frustrating.</p>
<p>The Golden Bank would target the entire nation, and they would continue to punish those who failed to repay them. They didn’t care if they had to fight a nation.</p>
<p>It was normal for them to cause a riot by scattering money from within, and it was clear they would destroy the nations by funding money to hostile nations. If they didn’t have the strength to tackle them, they would pit them against another nation. History clearly showed what could happen if one ignored the warnings of the Golden Bank.</p>
<p>“What did His Majesty say?”</p>
<p>“The same as always. His Majesty is not the same person we knew him to be. He is addicted to alcohol and women each day, and whenever he finds the chance, he goes to a gambling place. We have placed restrictions so that he cannot touch the nation’s treasury, but there is no way we can control debts that are stamped with the national seal.”</p>
<p>“There are outside forces that encourage His Majesty to do things like this. As long as they are alive, the problem will continue to happen.”</p>
<p>Redford. The nation was in decline. Even though the citizens didn’t know the seriousness of the situation, Count London knew that their downfall was imminent.</p>
<p>The treasury was drying up. If a riot broke out, the meaning of the nation would be lost. Knowing that was the goal the empire wanted, Count London went to make money.</p>
<p>In the process, he even thought of a rebellion, but according to the information he found, he realized the King was being influenced by outside forces. The outside forces hoped that those who cared for the nation would rebel, and they would use that as a chance to purge the rebellion and bring peace to the nation.</p>
<p>With limited options, all he could do was hold onto the crumbling legs of the nation. And then a person went up to him.</p>
<p>It was the Treasurer. The fact that the person who was supposed to report to the King secretly approached Count London meant that the reality of the nation had changed.</p>
<p>‘Is there no other way?’</p>
<p>At the corner of his desk, he looked at the picture of his father. In the photo taken with magic during his lifetime, the man looked just like Count London with a huge smile. In fact, people remembered his father more.</p>
<p>He was a very patriotic man to the point where everyone respected him, and he didn’t let go of his concerns for the nation until the day he died in an accident.</p>
<p>When he died, people didn’t like the new heir to London. Unlike his father, his reputation in the world was that he was trash and hurt people to make money.</p>
<p>Count London said,</p>
<p>“Redford is running to the edge of a cliff. Knowing that the nation will fall over it one day, we cannot just abandon it and run away. We need to make a list of those who are willing to help us. First of all, the debt with the Golden Bank needs to be settled so we can be safe.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The Treasurer bowed his head, and Count London looked at the ceiling as he leaned back on his chair.</p>
<p>The painted ceiling—it seemed to represent the reality of their nation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He didn’t look at Dmitry’s side from the start. He first started visiting friendly nations, but they all expressed how they were in troubling positions.</p>
<p>“Count London. Rumors are going around across the land about the Redford Kingdom and that no one is lending you money. No matter how much interest is promised, wouldn’t it be a loss if your nation collapses before you pay us back? I am sorry. Shouldn’t you be looking at reality now?”</p>
<p>There were ten meetings, and all ten of them resulted in rejections. Count London’s feet hurt. He walked a long distance and earnestly asked them, but most of them coldly refused him.</p>
<p>And then he remembered Dmitry. Even though they weren’t close friends, there might be a chance since they were super wealthy and had a hostile relationship with the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>A glimpse of hope. It was the feeling of holding onto the last straw. Hence, he went to visit Roman, and at the sight of him opening the door, he went straight for him.</p>
<p>‘Roman Dmitry, the best talent on the continent who had taken down Commander Gustavo in one hit. According to the rumors, Roman Dmitry is a cool-headed person, and if he knows Redford’s situation, then the chances of him lending money are slim.’</p>
<p>He also knew the reality, but there were no other options. Rumors spread that Dmitry was being led by Roman Dmitry and not Duke Romero, so he looked for Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman sat across from him. After briefly greeting each other, they immediately went down to business.</p>
<p>“I am sorry for asking you this in the first place, but please lend us 100,000 gold. Of course, I know that it is very unreasonable to make this request. There is nothing tying us together, and even if we borrow money, we have nothing to pay you back with.”</p>
<p>He spoke honestly. He wasn’t going to lie to borrow money.</p>
<p>London and Dmitry. Both were families with merchant blood. It was clear that using absurd excuses would only trouble them longer because of the huge amount of money being requested, and there was no benefit from lying to the Dmitry family now.</p>
<p>The interest was nothing. If Redford and London fell, the party who gave the money would lose both the original amount and the interest.</p>
<p>“If the debt with the Golden Bank cannot be repaid, Redford will collapse. I would like to avoid that. Roman Dmitry. You know the importance of Redford. The Kingdoms’ Alliance is barely standing, and if Redford falls, the alliance will lose its power to stop the Kronos Empire. So please lend us strength. We cannot stand without the help of other nations.”</p>
<p>This transaction could turn the situation upside down. It wasn’t a gain for Dmitry, but he appealed to them, who hated Kronos, by saying that Redford needed help.</p>
<p>Count London was smart. To be honest, he made Redford’s problem everyone’s problem. He described the situation as such.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry calmly listened to him and asked, after a sip of tea,</p>
<p>“I’ve heard rumors about Count London. Redford’s Godfather. A being who plundered the assets of others around him to accumulate wealth through cruel business skills. People call you trash, scum, and a bloodless person. But the Count London I am meeting right now seems different from the rumors.”</p>
<p>His public reputation was different from what his eyes showed. At least the people in Redford never considered him a patriot.</p>
<p>“Please explain to me why you, with such a reputation, are working hard for Redford. Actually, aren’t people with money able to live fine if they throw away their patriotism?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman’s words put him into silence. Count London looked at his opponent without saying a word.</p>
<p>His public reputation—he was aware of it. People cursed Count London, who secured his business even when the nation was collapsing and took the assets of those around him, and how he never spent money on others.</p>
<p>However, it was Count London who, despite being pointed at by the people, was handling the money issue. The reality was different. Most of his hard-earned money was used to solve Redford’s financial problems.</p>
<p>Count London said,</p>
<p>“…. A couple of years ago, I wasn’t very interested in the state of affairs of my nation. It was my goal to inherit my family’s business and be the best merchant on the continent. But when you accumulate so much wealth, you see the truth that people don’t know. The King and his actions. People are saying that the King is making life difficult for them, but those who know the truth are aware that what is happening is odd. I am convinced that Kronos is behind this.”</p>
<p>Their King had been put into this gambling obsession by someone. At first, he was delighted to make money, but within a year, the King turned into a gambling addict and frequented the gambling place where influential people gathered.</p>
<p>How did a small kingdom’s King get into that kind of place in the first place? Questions arose, and Count London knew that the forces behind them were the reason for Redford’s downfall.</p>
<p>“Redford’s rich family. How do you think our family will be viewed by those who are trying to bring down the nation? My father’s death wasn’t an accident. A person who is patriotic and has the wealth to help would have been considered a hurdle by many. So I ruined my public reputation. I trampled on people, stole their assets, and got criticized, but I do not regret it. The people I had taken down were all bastards. I took their properties and gave them back to the nation.”</p>
<p>Beyond his memory, Count London, who inherited the family, was not trying this hard to have a patriotic image.</p>
<p>However, as time passed, something became certain. Watching how the nation collapsed with his father’s death, he couldn’t let go of the thought that Kronos was behind this. So now he has dedicated his life to Redford.</p>
<p>No matter how people judged him, it didn’t matter. He had one purpose. In order to protect the nation that his father built, he didn’t care what people thought of him.</p>
<p>Count London said,</p>
<p>“I have no intention of making you take on all the responsibilities of the 100,000 gold. As collateral for this transaction, I will bet not only the London family’s land but also our heirlooms. Even if things get worse. For Dmitry, it wouldn’t be too much of a loss. And if Redford fixes the problem and things return to normal, not only the London family but also Redford will never forget the grace that you have shown.”</p>
<p>When he was done talking, Count London was sure of it.</p>
<p>‘This would be a flat-out refusal too.’</p>
<p>Dmitry—a family of merchants who rose to their current position by selling metals—had no reason to take up this offer. A nice friendship? A story? Their hatred for Kronos?</p>
<p>This problem wasn’t even theirs. The fire that fell on the feet of others wouldn’t even touch them. But then…</p>
<p>“I get it. I will accept your offer.”</p>
<p>An answer was given.</p>
<p>Count London, who had already given up, couldn’t hide the shock on his face.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 217 - Count London (2)</p>
<p>The 1st-degree assassination targets—their existence was the weakness of the Kingdoms’ Alliance. If the Drake family of the Umberto Kingdom was the core of the military that supported them, Count London of the Redford Kingdom could be the last hope of the nation.</p>
<p>The moment he gave up, everything would be over. Redford’s debt, which had been somehow prevented, would quickly plunge the kingdom into ruin. They were at the cliff’s edge.</p>
<p>Count London’s voice was sincere. He didn’t hesitate to bow his head even though he went to a person he knew nothing about, and despite being a rich man, he knew to extend his hand.</p>
<p>‘The Golden Bank’s debt is just starting. If they start pressuring Redford in earnest, the people will have to pay off Redford’s debt, or they will try to leave the nation immediately. Before the nation’s pillars get broken down, they’ll be eager to get something out of it.’</p>
<p>The kingdom had one pillar called London, which supported the huge land. Looking at the pillars in the strong wind, Roman Dmitry spoke,</p>
<p>“As Count London said, I will accept the collateral as the bare minimum of safety. But Count London, and I know that this deal isn’t much of a benefit to Dmitry. So do your best. Just as Cairo defeated the remnants of Kronos and regained stability, Redford should also do that.”</p>
<p>100,000 gold. It wasn’t just out of good intentions. For the balance of the continent, he bought Redford. It was Roman Dmitry’s judgment that the longer the kingdoms held out, the more power and time Dmitry would get.</p>
<p>At that moment, Count London was speechless. He didn’t think that would be his answer. He ran everywhere to get help, but he never expected to receive a positive response from the Dmitry family. The beings who were friendly to their kingdom had turned their backs on him, but Roman Dmitry said he would extend his hand despite knowing their condition.</p>
<p>Of course, he also knew the truth. The downfall of Redford would mean that Roman Dmitry would have to get into war, and an all-out war wasn’t on his mind right now.</p>
<p>Even though he knew that, he felt odd. Actually, despite running around until his feet became sore, he thought that Redford might just collapse.</p>
<p>‘… It isn’t the end, then.’</p>
<p>His father, who always thought about the safety of the nation, said, ‘If you don’t give up until the end, then the answer will come.’</p>
<p>The real end. It was when he lowered his head and couldn’t look at the reality in front of him because he found no other way, his father planted a solid emotion inside Count London’s head, saying he shouldn’t give up.</p>
<p>A child who had grown up in a rich family setting since childhood. Taking over the burdens of his family, he looked at Roman Dmitry with a determined face.</p>
<p>“I will not forget this day. We will somehow overcome the crisis in Redford and repay Dmitry for helping us out.”</p>
<p>The last chance—Count London strongly held to that chance.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Five days prior to the debt repayment. Returning to Redford, Count London prepared to meet the Golden Bank. Even though the money was ready, that was just the start.</p>
<p>In order to solve the issue with the Golden Bank and get things to work, other issues needed to be slowly addressed, and the most important thing now was self-growth.</p>
<p>Because they couldn’t continue to receive the power of external forces forever, he studied various ways to expand the business of the London family and earn money in the right manner.</p>
<p>In the process, Dmitry looked like a true savior. Commercial cooperation opened the way for the smooth export of resources.</p>
<p>Two days later, Roman Dmitry visited Redford. It was to deliver the money that was promised and to see Redford with his own eyes.</p>
<p>“Mr. Roman Dmitry. Welcome!”</p>
<p>At Roman’s visit, Count London had a bright smile. At first, they didn’t have a connection, but they were now valuable guests in Redford and London, to the extent that they would welcome them.</p>
<p>He opened the door to the mansion. A party was prepared for Roman Dmitry, and upon entering, soft music began to flow.</p>
<p>“Mr. Roman Dmitry, we prepared this for you. I hope you enjoy this place comfortably with your companions.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>He nodded. Sipping the champagne, Roman looked around.</p>
<p>‘Redford found a clue to solving the nation’s problem. As for the Kronos Empire, they will no longer welcome the existence of Count London. They will definitely be trying to bring him down. It’s not clear when, but it will be before the negotiations with the Golden Bank are initiated.’</p>
<p>The visit wasn’t just for him to take a look. If it was just to deliver the money, he could have just given it the same day they met, or he could just send a subordinate, but he visited the place on purpose.</p>
<p>Even until the day of the negotiations, he decided to keep Count London safe. If he were assassinated before the negotiations, then Redford would fall.</p>
<p>“Chris.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Find out the structure of the London mansion. If the situation we are concerned about happens, the safety of the Count is a priority.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Chris took a step back. He disappeared from the party with his troops, and Roman Dmitry smelled the champagne.</p>
<p>This was the night before the storm. The people of Redford had a bright future ahead of them, but right under their chins, Kronos was preparing something.</p>
<p>Redford and London—they were worth using. If they could get over this crisis and get back on track, they would become a strong support for the Kingdoms’ Alliance.</p>
<p>Count London’s expression and his eyes showed they were worth helping. His reason for taking such a long step was to secure a reliable ally for the future.</p>
<p>However, on the other side of the party, the servants carrying the food had stiff faces at the sound of people laughing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On that evening, a man who went to a shabby pub put down his beer mug nervously.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>“<em>Tch!</em> The arrogant nobles. The nation is having a hard time, but they are having a party with expensive food and laughing.”</p>
<p>It was a servant, Jacqueline.</p>
<p>This party was quite excessive. Count London prepared the best party to show his gratitude with food and drinks, which was something they shouldn’t do in a crisis.</p>
<p>Jacqueline was temporarily brought in from outside for the party. For him, who didn’t know much about Dmitry and London’s story, watching the happy faces of the people holding their stomachs and laughing made him upset.</p>
<p>“Jacqueline, what is it?”</p>
<p>The bar owner asked.</p>
<p>Like Jacqueline, he was also reflecting on his life, and he seemed curious about the customer.</p>
<p>“What is it? This time, I went to work at the London family for a party, and they were all laughing hahahaha with food laid out that most commoners could have eaten for a year. Does it make sense? The Redford royal family insists on taxing and persecuting us every time, saying that the nation is in trouble. Yet, the nobles get to enjoy their own luxurious life like always!”</p>
<p>He drank the beer, and even though it was cold beer, he didn’t feel the heat inside of him stop.</p>
<p>“And what? A place to celebrate harmony with Dmitry? Fucking trash! So many people lost their jobs as Count London’s business ate the other ones. And what did that guy even do for the nation? We are living so hard because of greedy people who only care about money, but upon seeing Roman Dmitry laughing and eating with them, it made my stomach hurt.”</p>
<p>“The nobles have always been like that. When did those guys think about our safety?”</p>
<p>“Still, they hold power. If the nation is suffering, they should be thinking about us and not the other nation’s people.”</p>
<p>He expressed more anger. When Jacqueline raised his voice, people gathered in twos and threes and reacted similarly to him.</p>
<p>“There is no such thing as helping out anymore. Count London is committing a traitorous act against the nation by hoarding the wealth of the nation and giving it to people like Dmitry. How long do we have to hold onto our hungry bellies? If things continue like this, it is obvious we will die from hunger, and not because of the Kronos Empire picking a war with us.”</p>
<p>Slowly, it began to rise. The remarks crossed the line, and Jacqueline’s eyes flashed with killing intent.</p>
<p>Right then, the owner of the pub signaled the staff to lock the door and said in a hushed voice,</p>
<p>“Jacqueline. As you said, at this rate, all of us might die from starvation. Right now, your wife is about to give birth to her third child, and she can’t eat properly, so she isn’t even lactating. Then let’s turn this situation around. If we rob Count London’s mansion, steal their wealth, and leave Redford, we can survive starvation.”</p>
<p>“…W-What?”</p>
<p>Jacqueline was shocked. Even though he was angry, attacking the nobles was a different thing.</p>
<p>However, the reactions of the others were different. When the people showed a reaction of agreeing with it, even Jacqueline began to get pushed into the idea.</p>
<p>“Right, fuck this. We cannot stay like this forever. Let’s call together people who will agree to this and go get our rightful share from Count London.”</p>
<p>It was a small thing that pissed them off at first, but now it was burning in flames.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeiik.</em></p>
<p>Fire broke out. Torches lit the night road, and a group of people strode to Count London’s mansion.</p>
<p><em>Click.</em></p>
<p>The weapons were clacking, and they weren’t really weapons but tools for farming, such as scythes and others.</p>
<p>And the mansion appeared.</p>
<p>The guards who were guarding the front gate raised their weapons with shocked faces.</p>
<p>“Stop!”</p>
<p>“If you come closer, we will have to attack you.”</p>
<p>There were just two guards outside, and the number of commoners was too great. As Jacqueline raised his voice, hundreds of people rushed in, making the guards feel overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The guards gulped despite having weapons in hand, and their eyes wouldn’t stop shaking.</p>
<p>And being the representative, Jacqueline said,</p>
<p>“Call Count London right now!”</p>
<p>“He isn’t someone you can just call out like that!”</p>
<p>“Like what? Fucking dog! Count London is a traitor who is selling the nation. The people of Redford are starving, with no food to eat or feed their wives, but he invites outsiders and holds parties for them. If he had given us the money he spent on the party, we would have had a couple of warm days at home. So call Count London right now. I need to see and speak to him.”</p>
<p>They were enraged. The original plan was to kill the guards and loot the place, but common people had a conscience that didn’t allow that. Jacqueline chose to summon Count London, and as a commoner, it took a voice accompanied by force to create such a situation. So he called people.</p>
<p>At first, people were taken aback by the fact that they would visit a noble family, but when they heard about what had happened, they all expressed their anger.</p>
<p>Redford. It was a nation of poor people. In the place where beggars were everywhere, even if they only went out on the streets, they didn’t even get to see the nobles with their heads raised.</p>
<p>Jacqueline gritted his teeth. If things went wrong, a shred of their conscience would get broken, and the scythes would plunge into the necks of the guards.</p>
<p>And it was at that moment that the gate opened.</p>
<p>Was it Count London?</p>
<p>The moment their eyes focused there, contrary to people’s expectations, Roman Dmitry opened the door and appeared.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 218 - Count London (3)</p>
<p>The commoners—most of them didn’t know Roman Dmitry’s face. They were familiar with the rumors, but being able to recognize Roman Dmitry in Redford was a different thing. However….</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry!”</p>
<p>“It’s that guy! Count London is now working with the Dmitry family to steal the fortune of Redford! Traitors! Aren’t you even a bit ashamed of what is happening?”</p>
<p>Some of the crowd suddenly raised their voices which made things embarrassing for Jacqueline. He recognized Roman Dmitry because he was at the party and had no intention of provoking him.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was a rumored aura user. And knowing how strong the man was, he didn’t want to touch Roman Dmitry. That was the plan, but their sudden actions ruined it all. To the remarks that provoked Roman Dmitry, Jacqueline couldn’t back down and stood there.</p>
<p>At the series of events, Roman Dmitry looked at the people who raised their voices.</p>
<p>‘They are a mix of rogues.’</p>
<p>It was a rebellion of the commoners. They were expressing their suppressed anger. However, based on Jaqueline’s reaction to the way he recognized him and the provocation, it wasn’t difficult to know that the rebels who instigated this were in the group.</p>
<p>It was as he had expected. The Kronos Empire had prepared weapons to attack Count London. In Cairo, they used traitors who wanted to devour the nation and used assassins called shadows against him, and now they were using the angry public sentiment to destroy the London family.</p>
<p>It was fun. The Kronos Empire spread chaos all over the continent in various ways. Without actively using the power of the empire, they created a situation where the enemies would collapse because of their own people. That was the way of the empire.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“A traitor who sells out his country. Is there any clear basis for those words?”</p>
<p>“There is no need for any evidence! Roman Dmitry! If you truly know justice, get out of Redford and don’t get involved! Don’t take away Redford’s riches! It has been earned by the blood and sweat of the people. The malicious London family is monopolizing it and living happily by themselves. If that isn’t traitorous, then what is the meaning of that?”</p>
<p>He had succumbed to evil. As things turned out, Jacqueline showed no signs of backing down.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>It was like a blazing fire, and it wasn’t strange for a fight to ensue.</p>
<p>Their words and their expressions—Roman Dmitry looked at the people. Dealing with people who couldn’t see the reality in front of them wasn’t so difficult, but whether it was worth intervening in was Redford’s problem.</p>
<p>Actually, the way to calm the angry public sentiment that appeared in London was simple. The truth—that alone was enough. If London revealed what he did, he wouldn’t be called a traitor, but….</p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The gate opened, and the London family knights came out and spoke in a voice no one could hear.</p>
<p>“… Mr. Roman Dmitry. Count London doesn’t want you to get into trouble. Please come inside. We will sort out the anger of our people on our own.”</p>
<p>At that point, Roman Dmitry had no reason to confront the commoners.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>He headed inside. With a slightly bitter expression, Count London said,</p>
<p>“I am sorry for getting you involved in this. Actually, this isn’t the first time it has happened. There have been several occasions when people who have been starving attacked my place. Of course, they weren’t as extreme as the group that appeared at the mansion today, but the patience of the people seems to be wearing thin.”</p>
<p>On this day, he hoped for a peaceful solution. The knights of London went out and offered a compromise with leftover food from the party and financial compensation, and the anger of the people who achieved their goal faded.</p>
<p>Except for the panic, the situation didn’t become too extreme. They didn’t know what would happen if Roman Dmitry, who was rumored to be a battle manic, decided to come out, and it would become a real problem, so they withdrew.</p>
<p>London’s way was foolish. If it had been Roman Dmitry, no matter what their reason was, he wouldn’t have made the people go back alive if they had attacked him. However, this was Redford, not Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry asked,</p>
<p>“Why not tell them the truth? The Londons aren’t responsible for the poverty of the nation. No matter how much you hold on, being targeted as a traitor isn’t nice. Excuse me for saying this, but the King has to bear the responsibility for this.”</p>
<p>From Roman’s words, he thought it was a common question to ask. Everyone who knew the truth asked him the same thing, but Count London couldn’t do that.</p>
<p>“… I know very well what it means for London. But I don’t think it’s for Redford. We are now living in an age of hatred. When a problem arises, people want to make others take on the responsibility. If it is revealed that the King was the one who started the troubles, what do you think will happen to Redford?”</p>
<p>From then on, things would change. The people’s anger would be directed toward the royal family, and the nation would be in chaos once again.</p>
<p>“If people who can only be freed by blaming others aim for His Majesty, we don’t know what will happen to the nation. People will flare up, and perhaps the nation will collapse from within even before Kronos fights us. So the truth cannot be revealed. If the people’s anger isn’t directed at the royal family but at someone like me, then their anger will be limited and hinder the escalation, and they will just attack my mansion. After all, I am also just an existence under the royal family, so their anger will not spread throughout the kingdom.”</p>
<p>He was also a normal person, and he didn’t like criticism. Seeing people swear at him, he also wanted to tell the truth one day, but the benefits of doing so seemed meaningless. People would praise him as a hero, but then their anger would turn to the royal family. If that were the case, what would the reputation of being a hero mean?</p>
<p>If the nation collapses and a rebellion breaks out, all of the hard work he has done so far would have no choice but to become meaningless. Hence, he withheld the truth.</p>
<p>He smiled and looked at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Redford’s troubles aren’t the problems of His Majesty alone. Even if they were to make him take responsibility and bring him down, Redford would be engulfed in further turmoil due to the forces that encouraged the King to neglect this situation. It is much better if I take the blame for the people. At least for me, I have the strength to accept criticism and be safe at the same time. So until Redford has a foundation to survive, the people shouldn’t know the truth.”</p>
<p>During the past few years, the weight that Count London has been carrying has been heavy. And looking at his figure, Roman Dmitry recalled a person’s face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yu Hyun, a Demonic Sect member. He was a unique person. In a world that spoke of the rule of the strong, humans were basically believed to be born with good sides, and unlike his position as an heir to a noble family, he didn’t have any greed for power.</p>
<p>Maybe it was because he lived a different life from Baek Joong-hyuk, but the two of them felt an inexplicable attraction towards each other and they often spent time together.</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk asked him,</p>
<p>“I heard that you went to the slums and helped the people. Why do you have to act as such? You may have simply acted with good intentions, but after that, the people will wait for it every day. And if you don’t show up again, they will get angry, saying that your one good intention was only out of sympathy.”</p>
<p>There were things that people misunderstood. Poverty and wealth. There was a belief that conflicting values represented character.</p>
<p>However, the world that Baek Joong-hyuk lived in wasn’t like that. Some people have described the poor as living by helping each other and the rich as villains who exploit such poverty. But was that really the truth?</p>
<p>Just because they were rich, they weren’t unconditionally evil, and poor people didn’t just have humanity because they were poor.</p>
<p>At the bottom of life, people’s greed shone, and Baek Joong-hyuk had seen how the people who were the weakest killed one another for the sake of one rice ball. Whether they were poor or rich, humans were humans. Even if they were in the same environment, their personalities would form differently, and Baek Joong-hyuk didn’t hastily judge another’s environment.</p>
<p>What he had seen and felt. He thoroughly judged his opponents based on his experience with them, and only those who accepted that truth were worthy of Baek Joong-hyuk’s trust.</p>
<p>Yu Hyun said,</p>
<p>“…Well. As you said, people might resent me, but I just do what my heart tells me to. If there is someone else like you in the world, then shouldn’t it be balanced out if there was someone like me?”</p>
<p>He smiled.</p>
<p>Despite that look, Baek Joong-hyuk couldn’t smile because his and Yu Hyun’s paths were different. Even though he was the son of the Heavenly Demon, he started as the bottom feeder in life, and Yu Hyun was born into a prestigious family and saw good things.
.
A kind heart could have been born from such a background. At least if he had experienced the life Baek Joong-hyuk did, he wouldn’t be saying such things.</p>
<p>But still, he didn’t hate Yu Hyun. The time he had spent with him was like a ray of light as he wandered in darkness.</p>
<p>And one year later, Yu Hyun’s naked body was discovered abandoned in the slum.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Yu Hyun and Count London. They were similar types of people. Living a single life, they believed in and followed values that were more important than their own comfort.</p>
<p>After parting ways, Roman Dmitry looked out at the black sky.</p>
<p>“Stupid people.”</p>
<p>On the day Yu Hyun died, Baek Joong-hyuk overturned the entire slum. Meanwhile, he found the people who had been in contact with Yu Hyun, and only after driving countless people to their deaths did he find out who killed Yu Hyun.</p>
<p>It was a boy in his early teens. When he looked at him with both ears cut off and bleeding, he asked him why. Then the boy spoke with a terrified face,</p>
<p>“… Everyone was afraid that he would never visit us again.”</p>
<p>A one-month visit. The starving people didn’t remember the grace that was shown to them.</p>
<p>The boy looked at Yu Hyun’s expensive clothes when he was about to leave after he helped them. As he turned around like that, someone hit Yu Hyun on the back of his head. Despite the blood splashing and his groans, the boy wanted the clothes he desired.</p>
<p>The boy and Jacqueline were no different. If one looked at the world a little wisely, one would know what Count London did for the people.</p>
<p>Not knowing the truth was not an excuse. Jacqueline had been invited to the party, so he could work for a short time and bring some food home after the party. And if he wasn’t angry at the nobles for spending money, he would have felt gratitude.</p>
<p>And he was used just like that. The reason he visited the mansion at night was probably because there had been a conversation about not tolerating his actions.</p>
<p>Yu Hyun and Count London. They were an existence that normal people would not dare to look up to, yet they were forced to sacrifice for the sake of the people.</p>
<p>It was stupid, and he didn’t like that. However…</p>
<p>‘It isn’t my business.’</p>
<p>In his previous life and even now, Roman Dmitry had no intention of pushing his values onto others. If Count London offered to sacrifice himself, he wouldn’t even bother talking about it.</p>
<p>His visit to Redford—his role there was to solve the problem with the Golden Bank.</p>
<p>He turned his steps. As he looked up at the sky, his mind felt complicated.</p>
<p>The night was late.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the day that the Golden Bank had set was dawning.</p>

<p>Chapter 219 - Count London (4)</p>
<p>It was early in the morning, and Count London immediately got into the carriage. The meeting with the Golden Bank was scheduled in the same city, but 100,000 gold coins couldn’t be transported on foot.</p>
<p>Every time the carriage moved on bumpy ground, the carriage shook. Because the budget of the nation wasn’t that great now, the capital was as bad as a rural place.</p>
<p>Inside the carriage, Count London stared at the gold coins. The hard-earned money and even London’s land and heirlooms would be used to overcome the crisis of the nation. And the people who knew the truth said Count London was insane.</p>
<p>If he stood one step away from the reality of the nation and looked at the situation, he would be able to live comfortably regardless of being in Redford or not. The Kronos Empire was tolerant to many. If they raised their voices to betray the nation, Kronos wouldn’t even touch them.</p>
<p>He knew that too. Merchants were known to be good at calculating the best in things and would never step into a loss.</p>
<p>‘The debt with the Golden Bank is just the beginning. With this, Redford’s game will change.’</p>
<p>If the debt was paid, he would find the King. If he didn’t accept the choice for the sake of the nation again, he intended to overthrow the nation, even if he would be called a traitor by the people.</p>
<p>In the meantime, he suppressed his thoughts of rebellion as a last resort. However, a few days ago, the King’s successor, the Prince, agreed to it.</p>
<p>“Count London. The nation is driven to the brink. If my father’s reign is leading to the downfall of the nation, I must make a decision for Redford, as I am bound to inherit it.”</p>
<p>Actually, the King of Redford wasn’t like that from the start. Before falling into a gambling addiction, he was the kind of King who was strong. The people wholeheartedly respected the King, but a few years ago, something happened that broke his spirit.</p>
<p>The three children of the King. Among his two sons and one daughter, his eldest son died in an accident while he was practicing horseback riding, and his youngest daughter suffered from losing her brother and hung herself.</p>
<p>The series of accidents made him fall into despair. He drank each day and found pleasure in gambling. It was the pleasure of making money. The intense stimulation of blowing away the sadness of losing his children made him unable to escape it. For that reason, the Count didn’t want to give up on the King.</p>
<p>Apart from the fact that the nation would be ruined by traitors after a rebellion, it was difficult for him to accept a situation where the King would get backstabbed.</p>
<p>But it was now past the limit. Now that the debt is going to be settled with Dmitry’s money, Redford would have to use this opportunity to not get into any more debts and pay them back slowly.</p>
<p>Rebellion was complicated. Memories of his past complicated his mind. And so…</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>The carriage began to rock, and the horses neighed as the carriage halted.</p>
<p>“Protect the carriage!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>A knight shouted. The outside of the carriage seemed to be in intense chaos.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the wide road, at a quiet time when there were still a few people coming and going, people appeared from all sides and rushed at them at once.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>“There are gold coins there!”</p>
<p>There were as many as a hundred people, and all of their eyes were shining with greed. Their shabby appearance and the weapons they were carrying were rough, and their number was what filled the vision of Count London’s men.</p>
<p>The soldiers hurriedly raised their shields. They went close to each other to protect one another, but they didn’t expect to get attacked right in the middle of the capital.</p>
<p>At last, the people rushed in. At the sight of them running with greed, the knights raised their auras and screamed,</p>
<p><em>Grrrrnnggg!</em></p>
<p>“Protect the carriage!”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>It was the start of the battle. As soon as the soldiers ran into the people, dozens of people screamed. It was because the people didn’t have any armor. The spears and knives of the soldiers cut through the clothes of the people at once, but the people didn’t stop running at them and trampled on the corpses.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Arms flew, and some had their throats slashed. In the midst of blood and death, someone finally drove a knife through the heart of a soldier.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered, and the entire place was in chaos. The soldiers couldn’t overcome their numbers and began to die, while the London knights gritted their teeth at the sight.</p>
<p>Their opponents were just normal people. It was impossible for them to deal with aura swordsmen, but there were those who were taking advantage of this chaos.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>“…!?”</p>
<p>A knight was shocked when a thorn got stuck in his neck. It was thrown by someone, which meant that an unusual person was mixed in with the crowd, but he couldn’t do anything as he was already losing consciousness.</p>
<p>His body staggered. The knight, who swung his sword and slashed the enemies until the moment he collapsed, had his face splattered with blood and his entire body cut to pieces by people rushing at him from all sides.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>The death of a knight deepened their defeat, and Count London, who checked the situation outside the carriage, screamed with a pale face,</p>
<p>“Stop this right now! The wealth in the carriage is important in solving the problems of the nation! If you are from Redford, you must not attack us! Stop! Please just stop! If this money gets stolen in the mess, Redford has no future!”</p>
<p>The purpose of the opponents seemed to be the money. So Count London shouted, but no one listened. At that moment….</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The world shook. Count London slumped forward, and his eyes began to lose focus. Blood flowed from the back of his head. His senses were fading, and he couldn’t even check who attacked him.</p>
<p>“Check the carriage!”</p>
<p>“Gold! Gold coins!”</p>
<p>The people were screaming for joy, and Jacqueline was among them. At first, he was only a thief who wanted to attack the mansion for the sake of money, but now, he boldly attacked the Count.</p>
<p>“… P-Please.”</p>
<p>He couldn’t say anything more. He wanted them to stop, but his dying voice didn’t reach them.</p>
<p>Suddenly, he thought of Roman Dmitry’s words. When he said that he didn’t have to help with the meeting with the Golden Bank, Roman Dmitry handed over the box of 100,000 gold coins and said,</p>
<p>“Be careful. The Count made the mistake of being lenient when help was needed. It doesn’t matter what the story of the people who attacked the mansion is. The London family and the Redford Kingdom. The moment they realize that the wall isn’t so high, it wouldn’t matter what strange things happen from then on.”</p>
<p>His words. Despite knowing what he meant, he ignored them. At least he didn’t want to accept that the nation he was trying to save had changed.</p>
<p>He gasped on the cold ground. Looking at Jacqueline taking the coins, he was speechless. With his consciousness fading, Count London passed out.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This attack. It came from a piece of information that the bar owner provided.</p>
<p>“Jacqueline. Early tomorrow morning, I received information that London is stealing the wealth of the nation. The information is given by a servant of the London family, and it seems like it is being moved to a safe place. The meeting with Dmitry was also for that reason. It is clear that he is leaving for Dmitry and not the Kronos Empire.”</p>
<p>Hearing that, Jacqueline was furious. The people of Redford knew the nation was dying, but there was no way to use their hands, and Redford’s most powerful man was running away.</p>
<p>He couldn’t tolerate it. The money the Londons earned by destroying others had to be retrieved.</p>
<p>“Dirty bastard. We can no longer stand by the sides and let the nobles do whatever they want.”</p>
<p>During the last incident, Count London stepped back. Even though they used crude weapons, he was willing to talk and compromise, and that gave Jacqueline the confidence. So that was how he robbed the wagon.</p>
<p>His eyes widened at the sight of the box of gold coins.</p>
<p>“H-How much is this?”</p>
<p>“Tens of thousands! Right?”</p>
<p>At that moment, he felt angry. Tens of thousands of gold coins were enough for a year of sustaining lives without worry, but this man, this noble, was ready to run away with it.</p>
<p>He was right. Redford’s people, who suffered and made the nobles rich, didn’t like how the money was being kept from them. He headed to the square and screamed, looking at the people.</p>
<p>“Everyone, gather here! From now on, I will give you one gold coin stolen from the traitor Count London!”</p>
<p>Jacqueline. He didn’t consider himself a rebel. He thought of himself as a righteous enemy. He was an existence that brought back the stolen money to its rightful place.</p>
<p>People flocked to the words ‘Gold Coins’ because they hadn’t eaten properly for months, and he gave each of them gold coins—one by one.</p>
<p>Jacqueline smiled brightly as the coins in the box became less. Even at that moment, he believed that he was doing the right thing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Count London didn’t show up past 9 o’clock, a man seemed upset.</p>
<p>“Treasurer. I think the Golden Bank understood the circumstances of the Redford Kingdom. We believed in His Majesty’s words and lent him a large sum of money and waived part of the interest until the end, even though the interest wasn’t paid and not even the principal was paid! What do we do now? It’s already past the scheduled time, so why is Count London not showing up?”</p>
<p>It was a member of the Golden Bank. He was an Executive Officer. He was a man with power who could plunge Redford into the abyss with a single word, so the Treasurer spoke with caution.</p>
<p>“We are truly sorry. Count London is not someone who wastes the time of others. I am sure that something must have happened…”</p>
<p>“Please do not say such nonsense!”</p>
<p><em>Pak!</em></p>
<p>He threw the papers, making the Treasurer’s eyes go wide in shock.</p>
<p>The Executive Officer said,</p>
<p>“We are not ignorant of that man’s reputation in Redford. He has a reputation for destroying the homes of others with his cruel business skills, and he handles things for his own interests. Even so, the Golden Bank doesn’t judge people based on such things. If our relationship had been smooth, I would have believed the Treasurer’s words and waited longer. However, all this while, has Count London fulfilled his promises? He had taken on this task on behalf of Redford and delayed repaying the money, and today, when he promised to meet us here, he didn’t even show up. Trust isn’t built in an instant. Rather than you saying he had something happen to him, I think it is better to say that he has abandoned the task.”</p>
<p><em>Kiik.</em></p>
<p>He got up from his seat, as there was no reason for him to stay any longer.</p>
<p>“From now on, the Golden Bank will classify the Redford Kingdom as a bad debtor. We will not choose any means for the debt to be repaid, and we will formally protest this issue to the International Community as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“E-Executive!”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>The Executive Officer turned around, and his attendants followed him. The Treasurer tried to hold onto him, and it was then….</p>
<p>“The heir to the Dmitry Duchy, Roman Dmitry is entering.”</p>
<p>From the door, the voice of a servant was heard. And as the door opened wide, people’s eyes were directed to one place at the same time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 220 - Count London (5)</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was an unexpected person. As the Executive Officer looked puzzled, Roman Dmitry casually sat down and looked up at the opponent.</p>
<p>“Sit down.”</p>
<p>“… What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>“Count London was in an accident. I am acting as a representative, so if you have anything to say, say it to me.”</p>
<p>The Executive’s gaze turned to the Treasurer. When asked why, the Treasurer also seemed to be puzzled by it.</p>
<p>No matter what happens, the place for negotiation was set here. An attendant also sat, looking disapprovingly at Roman Dmitry, and the Executive said,</p>
<p>“As a representative, you know the situation. Hence, the explanation of the preceding situation is omitted. The money that the Redford Kingdom has to repay to the Golden Bank is about 100,000 gold, including the principal and the interest. The problem is that it was like that 5 minutes ago. If London had shown up on time and paid back the 100,000 gold, the Golden Bank would have covered the previous problems and pursued an amicable relationship again.”</p>
<p><em>Kik.</em></p>
<p>He leaned forward, and with a somewhat stiff attitude, he looked at Roman.</p>
<p>“Time is money for us. It is our job to collect the interest on the money that went out of our pocket, depending on when it is returned. So do you think it is right for us to just end it at 100,000 gold, 5 minutes after 9 o’clock? In my opinion, no. It was exactly at 9 o’clock that we decided to receive the gold, and at the point when even a second passed, the Redford Kingdom had been declared a bad debtor and will be held accountable.”</p>
<p>“Don’t speak in circles. Get straight to the point.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>The official laughed. From the moment it went beyond the appointed time—no, to be precise, from the moment the money was borrowed until the end of the transaction, the Golden Bank was at the top.</p>
<p>“You will have to pay the overdue interest. It is 10% of the amount owed. If you pay back the 110,000 gold right away, I will forget about the bad memories here. From then on, it doesn’t matter if you borrow money again. As long as you are not a bad debtor, the Golden Bank is open to any transactions.”</p>
<p>“… 110,000 Gold!!!”</p>
<p>The Treasurer seemed shocked. 110,000 gold—that was a huge amount. Even just getting 100,000 gold was tough for Redford in their current situation, and now they wanted another 10,000 added to it.</p>
<p>Besides, the news of Count London being in an accident made him uncomfortable. In addition, the recent attacks on his home and the accident when transporting the money didn’t seem like a coincidence to him.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Count London had an accident on the way here. Somehow, the citizens aimed for the gold and attacked him, and he could not afford to pay back the 100,000 gold now. Let me ask you again.  Is paying 110,000 gold instead of 100,000 the only way to solve the money problem with the Golden Bank?”</p>
<p>“We aren’t obligated to consider the debtor’s situation. Only the promised date of repayment is important. Even if we are given 100,000 gold, what we want is 110,000 gold right now.”</p>
<p>It was a firm answer.</p>
<p>The Golden Bank or the Iron Blood Bank—people thought that they were simply a money-lending force, but there was no one as aggressive as them on the continent.</p>
<p>Only ruin awaited those who didn’t pay them back. Rather than the evils of the continent, like the empires, there were more people who crumbled because of the Golden Bank.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry paused for a moment. Then he met the other person’s gaze and said, as if it were not a big deal,</p>
<p>“I will ask you one last time. Is it money that you want or ruin?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>If one followed the history of the continent, one could find the Golden Bank’s name on the first page of history. They were the same. Many people fell into the abyss, both in the past and now, because of those who talked about debt.</p>
<p>“The Golden Bank is the fiend of gold coins. If you intend to do business with them, make sure to pay off your debts somehow, even if it means selling your soul. If not, the gold will destroy you and everything around you.”</p>
<p>It was wise advice. Against the background of the Golden Bank’s history, which had shown numerous examples, Roman Dmitry’s question was quite aggressive. So…</p>
<p>“What did you say just now?”</p>
<p>The Executive’s face went stiff at Roman’s words. It was a sensitive issue. People didn’t hesitate to criticize the actions of the Golden Bank, but no one said such things to their eyes.</p>
<p>It was a statement that no one would have dared to make, and despite his hostile gaze, as if he could end this any moment, Roman looked him in the eye.</p>
<p>“Actually, I am unsure of the intentions of the Golden Bank. You claim that you want the debt to be repaid, but there is no moneylender in the world who collects the debt at the cost of war. Even if you want to crush your opponent, you do it by possessing their things, not at the cost of war, which doesn’t have any financial gain. That is a stupid mistake. As a faction that makes money on interest, there is no need to make things worse by forcing people to pay back.”</p>
<p>“There is a difference between normal lending and the Golden Bank. It is a matter of promise. The reason people pay off their debt with the Golden Bank is that we have clearly demonstrated how we respond when they break their promises.”</p>
<p>“I also hope that the Golden Bank is just a simple lending business. However, there are parts I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>Tension was rampant. They didn’t pull out their swords, but neither side was backing out.</p>
<p>“When the Golden Bank lent money to the Redford Kingdom, the kingdom was already in a very complicated situation due to the King’s deviation from ruling it, and yet you lent them money. It means that you, who value the other side’s reliability and debt capabilities, lent tens of thousands of gold despite knowing it would be difficult to get back. It wasn’t convincing just because the other party was a King. Doesn’t the precedent prove that the Golden Bank is brutally trying to scrutinize the situation?”</p>
<p>On the page of history, if one went back along it, the Golden Bank was a mysterious force that appeared without anyone knowing its origins.</p>
<p>Who was the owner? Where were the funds coming from? No one knew. They suddenly appeared with money that no other nation had, and in an instant, they were reborn as a being with influence on the continent.</p>
<p>To this day, no one questioned them, and as the past proved their existence, people just accepted the Golden Bank for what it was.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry was different. Through the Lower District Sect, he also couldn’t find out anything about the Golden Bank, but he confirmed something. Just like in the case of the Redford Kingdom, they did things that made no sense.</p>
<p>If so, there could be one reason. He came to the conclusion that the Golden Bank’s actions were similar to those of the Kronos Empire, which wished for the destruction of the other nations.</p>
<p>Hearing those offensive remarks, the Executive’s face twisted. With a face ready to shout, he let out his anger.</p>
<p>“So you’re saying we lent money in hopes of ruining Redford? That is something I will not stand for. The negotiations are over. The Redford kingdom will be considered unwilling to repay the debt, and the remarks of the Dmitry family will be raised with the International Community.”</p>
<p><em>Jump.</em></p>
<p>He got up from his seat, and just as he was about to leave….</p>
<p>“Listen until the end.”</p>
<p>His steps stopped, and Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“Redford’s debt, I will pay it.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The situation was sorted out. Despite being enraged, the Executive couldn’t say no when the debt would be paid back, and that too in 110,000 gold.</p>
<p>Above all, the purpose of their business was money. If he didn’t accept the money right now, he couldn’t help but be caught up later and get asked if he was trying to make the bank lose money.</p>
<p>And so the situation was settled. The official left with an angry face, writing a document saying that Redford had paid back the debt.</p>
<p>But before leaving the room, he turned to Roman and said,</p>
<p>“The Dmitry family made a huge mistake today. I look forward to the next time we meet.”</p>
<p>At his warning, Roman Dmitry calmly drank tea.</p>
<p>From the series of events, the Treasurer, who had been holding his breath, spoke in a cautious voice,</p>
<p>“… Really, thank you. Thanks to you, the Redford Kingdom has survived a huge crisis.”</p>
<p>110,000 gold—that was a lot of money. The Dmitry family showed their wealth by lending 100,000 gold and repaying an additional 110,000 gold later.</p>
<p>The rumor that Dmitry’s wealth was enormous was true. It was said that all of the steel on the Salamander continent came from Dmitry, and Dmitry held a tight grip on it. They casually offered an amount that even most kingdoms would feel burdened with.</p>
<p>Furthermore, with the recent alliance with the dwarves, Dmitry was gaining more wealth than before.</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear a thank you. Dmitry didn’t help you for no reason.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry reacted coldly. He didn’t get up, as if he was waiting for someone. Even after drinking all the tea, he just sat there.</p>
<p>How long was it?</p>
<p>Finally, he heard someone running outside the door.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count London. When he came to his senses, it was past the appointed time.</p>
<p>“Count! We have a huge problem! It is said that the group who attacked us distributed all the gold coins to the citizens!”</p>
<p>“… No.”</p>
<p>It was devastating news. The 100,000 gold he had secured with great difficulty were literally gone, and there was no way he could get back the money that the citizens had taken.</p>
<p>Of course, if he used force, some of it would be returned, but blood would have to be shed to get the coins back into his hands. Even though Roman told him to be safe, he thought nothing would happen, and now this has happened.</p>
<p>Really, he was stupid. He was brilliant enough to make wealth, but he was not wise in matters related to nations. No. If he had been wise, he would have left the nation.</p>
<p>After recovering the casualties and organizing the situation, Count London headed straight to the meeting place. He didn’t have the ability to repay the debt now, but he could explain and buy some time.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry was there. And at the words of the Treasurer that the debt had been settled, he slumped down.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>“Redford owes a great deal to Roman Dmitry. I was robbed of the gold you had given me by the citizens, and without Mr. Roman Dmitry’s help, Redford would have collapsed due to the debt of the Golden Bank. Please say it. Anything. Redford will do anything it can to repay the kindness that has been shown to us for the rest of our lives.”</p>
<p>He bowed his head. It didn’t matter that he was bleeding. In a weeping voice, he expressed his gratitude to him.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry held a cold expression. Even the Treasurer watching from the sidelines knew that he wasn’t moved by this gesture.</p>
<p>“Count London. You seem to be very badly mistaken.”</p>
<p>It was a cold voice.</p>
<p>When Count London raised his head in surprise, he was only then able to face reality.</p>
<p>“The Count borrowed 100,000 gold from me and said he would take responsibility. With those words, for the sake of trusting a few Kingdoms’ Alliance members, Dmitry accepted the request of the Count, knowing that there wouldn’t be any financial gain. But how did this situation come about? The gold was stolen, and you lost the ability to repay, and I had to spend another 110,000 gold to solve Redford’s problem.”</p>
<p>When the carriage with the gold coins left and was attacked by the civilians, Roman Dmitry was informed of all of this.</p>
<p>There was definitely an opportunity for him to help the man if he made up his mind, but Roman Dmitry reached a more important conclusion than that. So….</p>
<p>“Redford’s incompetence brought out the worst of it. Count, this isn’t the time for you to say thank you.”</p>
<p>From now on, it was Dmitry’s turn to resolve the situation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 221 - Count London (6)</p>
<p>Why was the debt paid off? It wasn’t because of kindness. Roman Dmitry made it clear what he wanted to achieve from this.</p>
<p>“When the people stormed at the mansion and when the carriage with the gold left, I clearly warned the Count. A flimsy tolerance to their actions will remove the fear the people have, and from then on, anything can happen. But you trusted the people. You didn’t think they would corner a carriage in the middle of the capital.”</p>
<p>It was a mistake. It was said that the instigators led the situation, but the people’s dissatisfaction had created it.</p>
<p>Count London was a good person. He said that he wasn’t a patriot at first, but the fundamentals of inheriting his father’s blood didn’t change. So he had no choice but to make mistakes. Because the world he lived in was beautiful, he didn’t think that the people outside would think otherwise.</p>
<p>“The Count’s choice was reckless. At least, if you borrow money from others to solve something important, you shouldn’t trust anyone else but yourself. As a result, you broke your promise to the Dmitry family. If the 100,000 gold problem wasn’t solved, and if the Golden Bank hadn’t been repaid, the Redford Kingdom would have been caught up in a war. What do you plan on doing then? Are you going to regret what has already happened, come back to me, and borrow money again? We know very well that the lands of your ancestors and the London family that you pledged will not mean much. If we are going to rank your debts, the Golden Bank would even pull down the pillars of the London family before Dmitry could exercise our rights.”</p>
<p>The collateral’s existence. He knew from the start that it was pointless. If the Golden Bank began to lead a war, the fortunes of the London family couldn’t do much.</p>
<p>War was always like that. A war was waged to take everything from the losers, and what would the meaning of the documents signed by the owner of the land be?</p>
<p>Despite knowing that fact, Roman still accepted the offer, and even despite the possibility of never getting the 100,000 gold back, this job was worth accepting.</p>
<p>The attack on the carriage—he was watching it from the sidelines. If Count London died, his duty would end there.</p>
<p>Just like the death of Yu Hyun, he would be paying the price for what he chose to do. At that time, he would have given up on the card called London and found another person suitable to guide Redford.</p>
<p>“… I apologize.”</p>
<p><em>Drop. Drop.</em></p>
<p>Blood dripped from Count London’s head. He was dizzy from the wounds not being treated properly, but he couldn’t take his eyes off Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“I know words won’t work now. Redford and Dmitry. In our relationship, contrary to what I said, I really didn’t take responsibility for my words. I lost the money and made the wrong choice. So please tell me the answer. I think the fact that you didn’t abandon Redford and paid the debt is because of what you want from me.”</p>
<p>His red eyes were stained with realization. A good eye could see the reality, and he realized the problem could not be solved like this. But London still managed to live. Then it was time to execute the plan.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Dmitry and Redford’s promise is valid. The 210,000 gold has no deadline, but the price will double later, and what Count London has to do now is clear. I want you to reveal the truth to the people and tell them what you have done, not to be treated as a traitor but to be called a patriot. So…”</p>
<p>From the moment they first met, Roman Dmitry drew a picture in his head. Seeing Count London, who was treating himself foolishly and being judged as something else, he thought his foolish nature could be used.</p>
<p>The Kronos Empire. Those who compromised with reality were absolutely incapable of being hostile.</p>
<p>“Count London, raise a rebellion, and take the throne.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At a bar in Redford, the atmosphere was nice. Those who had a blast at work ate and drank in happiness.</p>
<p>“Drink!”</p>
<p>“For Redford!”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>The glasses clinked. Jacqueline gulped the drink down his throat and looked drunk.</p>
<p>It was nice. As he was distributing the gold coins, people tightly held Jacqueline’s hand and shed tears, saying he was a hero.</p>
<p>A few days ago, he was just a servant, and when he was worried about how to make a living, he leaped as the hero that Redford needed.</p>
<p>The hand holding the beer mug was stained with blood. Even though he had seen blood in the course of attacking the Count and his men, he didn’t regret it.</p>
<p>‘I was doing it for Redford.’</p>
<p>He was confident in it. Count London, who fell bleeding, had to pay the price for the mistakes he had made. He was a traitor to the people. If left alone, the trash that coveted things while destroying people would sell off the entire nation.</p>
<p>He drank the beer. People were looking at him and praising him as a hero.</p>
<p>“But where did the owner of the bar go?”</p>
<p>“What does it matter knowing? He told us to drink all the beer in the bar, so let us enjoy this moment to the fullest!”</p>
<p>Things had been sorted out, and the owner of the bar disappeared. But with Jacqueline there, people didn’t seem to care.</p>
<p>Attacking the nobles was treason. There was a chance that the people would be arrested by the guards of the capital, but Jacqueline and the people didn’t worry about that.</p>
<p>Jacqueline was now Redford’s hero. What would happen if the owner of the money came for him when the people would stand behind Jacqueline and be ready to give up their lives for him?</p>
<p>There would be a mess. From the moment Count London was attacked, the people decided not to stand by any longer.</p>
<p>“Jacqueline, no need to worry about the guards. We saw it too. When we attacked Count London, even the aura swordsmen fell. In fact, they’re nothing special. If those bastards try to come for you, they cannot capture you, even if they send the royal troops.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was right. One step broke the wall. The moment the fear of the opponent that they had been looking up to vanished, they felt like they could do anything.</p>
<p>The people smiled and laughed. They didn’t care about the future, and like now, they wanted to enjoy the happiness that they had never experienced before. It was then…</p>
<p><em>Clack.</em></p>
<p>“Find Jacqueline and bring him to me.”</p>
<p>A group of troops came in through the door, and the moment of happiness broke.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The pub was a mess. People tossed the glasses in their hands and grabbed their weapons to block the path of the soldiers.</p>
<p>“Jacqueline cannot be touched!”</p>
<p>“Damned bastards. What have you ever done for us, for you to try and touch the hero of Redford?!”</p>
<p>Their anger exploded. The people were drunk and swung their weapons before the soldiers.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>It was a steel sword. Since it was a weapon from Count London’s soldier who was killed, the weapon was wielded in the oddest way possible. Even so, the face of the running man overflowed with confidence. Having tasted victory once, they didn’t think the soldiers were a threat. At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>Blood splashed. At the same time as the man’s sword was cut down, his head floated in the air.</p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p>“H-His head has been blown off!!”</p>
<p>The people screamed. It was a single hit. They couldn’t even see what had happened, and the man’s head flew away in an instant.</p>
<p>At that moment, the people realized that the situation was serious. The soldiers stormed in with the symbol of Dmitry, not Redford.</p>
<p>“Those who stand in the way will be executed.”</p>
<p>It was Chris. The people of Redford didn’t know the laws of Dmitry. No matter who the opponent was, if a decision was made, they couldn’t control it, and Chris, known as Roman Dmitry’s right-hand man, was known to be a walking disaster.</p>
<p>At first, there were people who didn’t care and rushed at them, but when everyone was taken down in the blink of an eye, the people stopped running.</p>
<p>They were terrified. The people who said they would protect Jacqueline backed out like they didn’t want to be around Chris.</p>
<p>The path opened up, and Chris walked towards a man.</p>
<p>“Are you Jacqueline?”</p>
<p>The line between life and death made Jacqueline gulp. He knew he could die, but he decided to speak proudly about being the hero. And then, with the courage to face death….</p>
<p>“Right, I am Jac…”</p>
<p><em>Clench!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>Chris dragged him by the hair, and Jacqueline struggled and screamed in pain. And eventually, he was nothing but a normal person. As the pain took hold of his head, he couldn’t look proud anymore.</p>
<p><em>Pak.</em></p>
<p>He was thrown to the ground, and he trembled in fear. When he looked up, he looked at Roman Dmitry, who was looking down at him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Jacqueline was dragged to the square. People saw him writhing in pain as his hair was being pulled.</p>
<p>“Jacqueline is being dragged away.”</p>
<p>“Aren’t we supposed to help?”</p>
<p>“These jerks. How dare you touch the hero of Redford!”</p>
<p>The people were angry. At first, people who didn’t know what had happened followed and headed to the square where Roman was. Their faces showed a hint of anger.</p>
<p>They wanted to attack Roman right away and save their hero, but when they looked at Dmitry’s soldiers, they lost all their courage. However, there were some bold people among them. They ran all over the city to let everyone know.</p>
<p>“Right now, Jacqueline, the hero of Redford, is being dragged away by Roman Dmitry! He is the one who saved the nation from being abandoned! Everyone, wake up and bring weapons! We need to show what happens if our hero is touched! Let us show them!”</p>
<p>“Everyone to the square! Jacqueline is there!”</p>
<p>They cried out at the top of their voices. Their cries, which ignored death, colored the frightened crowd.</p>
<p>Everyone carried weapons. If they didn’t have proper weapons, they used farm items, and they looked enraged while holding them. If Jacqueline died, they might have to give up the gold coins, but they couldn’t accept that, so they decided to risk their lives for him.</p>
<p>Jacqueline was just a servant, but the moment people accepted him as a hero…</p>
<p>“Jacqueline! Jacqueline!”</p>
<p>“Jacqueline! Jacqueline!”</p>
<p>“Jacqueline! Jacqueline!”</p>
<p>The people raised their voices. Groups formed at all corners of the streets, and everyone headed there.</p>
<p>And Roman Dmitry was at the end, making Jacqueline kneel down. The people rushed there.</p>
<p>As people gathered with no time to lose, Roman remembered what he had said to Count London.</p>
<p>“Keep in mind that compassion is a prejudice too. The moment you mistakenly believe that you can help someone, the other person will use your compassion to drag you down. The criteria for judging people. It must be based on the facts that the Count had seen or heard, not just on what you were told. Just because you are a good person, it is dangerous to believe that the people that the Count helped are good too.”</p>
<p>Perhaps… maybe that was what he wanted to say to Yu Hyun.</p>
<p>He looked ahead.</p>
<p>A crowd in anger, and it was the perfect stage to reveal the truth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 222 - The Land Of Awakened Blind (1)</p>
<p>The crowd was growing in numbers. At first, the people who had been scared at the sight of Jacqueline being dragged away changed when they gathered as a group and showed ferocious force, as if they would even attack Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>People continued to pour into the square endlessly, and they paused a few steps away from Roman Dmitry and his men. It was tense.</p>
<p>A man from the crowd stepped forward and spoke on behalf of everyone,</p>
<p>“Jacqueline is the hero of Redford! What on earth did he do to persecute him?!”</p>
<p>“Everyone here should know. This man robbed the carriage of Count London and stole his gold.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry spoke calmly. His face didn’t seem to care about the crowd at all.</p>
<p>“Count London is a traitor who sold the nation! We saw and heard it, and we know he intends to play with the Dmitry family and side with you. The gold coins in the carriage were the property of Redford. He must have intended to steal it and run away to Dmitry. Jacqueline has only used the money of the traitor for the right thing, and you, a foreigner, cannot punish him!”</p>
<p>“Right!”</p>
<p>“Free Jacqueline right now!”</p>
<p>The people were angry. Their fear was gone, and their eyes glistened with murderous intent.</p>
<p>From one loot, they saw blood. They had come to think that the nobles were nothing and believed that thousands of them could take down Roman and his men. That was what common sense would tell people.</p>
<p>However, they didn’t know that a single human could kill all of them. They were ignorant and foolish. Even if they opened their eyes and ears, they didn’t seem to hear or see anything.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Where is the truth to what you claim?”</p>
<p>“What truth?! It is our experience! Count London is trash, and everyone knows that. After you visited, he stole some gold from somewhere and was running away. It wasn’t even a little gold. It was 100,000. If that huge amount of money is not used for running away, then what is it for?!”</p>
<p>“So you based that on just pure speculation?”</p>
<p>“Do not change my words! It is a fact!”</p>
<p>Betrayer, gold, Roman Dmitry—these three words led people to conclude that Count London was about to commit treason.</p>
<p>Roman chuckled. Their statement about not changing their words meant that there wasn’t any truth to them.</p>
<p>“Innocent people died because of you. The soldiers and knights who followed Count London did nothing wrong, and yet you killed them for a statement that cannot be proved. It is different from normal theft. People died, yet you continue to speak the same words like a parrot. There is no evidence, but you claim to be right. There is no evidence, but Count London is a traitor.”</p>
<p>He took something out of his sleeves. Then he undid the cloth and threw the papers at Jacqueline.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>“Read it.”</p>
<p>His unexpected behavior made everyone present confused. What could the documents inside be?</p>
<p>Jacqueline looked at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p><em>Whoosh.</em></p>
<p>He picked up the papers, and the moment he began to read them, his face was shocked.</p>
<p>“… W-What is this?”</p>
<p>He was confounded. His eyes went wide as he looked back and forth between Roman and the papers.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>His eyes trembled at the documents. He couldn’t accept this reality. However, the official seal stamped there proved that the documents were real.</p>
<p>“Read it.”</p>
<p>The voice called out, and Jacqueline gulped. His face was pale, as he was unable to handle the reality in front of him.</p>
<p>“… The Golden Bank certifies through these documents that Roman Dmitry of the Dmitry family has repaid the 110,000 gold borrowed by the Redford Kingdom from the Golden Bank.”</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>He dropped the papers and looked in disbelief at Roman Dmitry, who calmly said,</p>
<p>“You clearly said it was supposed to be 100,000 for him to run away, right? But the truth is there in the documents, and it was money to pay off the debts of this kingdom. A few days ago, he received an ultimatum from the Golden Bank about the money, and he borrowed that money from me. If the carriage had arrived safely, we wouldn’t have needed to pay an additional 10,000 gold as interest. It is the truth that you have chosen to ignore until now.”</p>
<p>“Bullshit!”</p>
<p>Jacqueline groaned and screamed. This was really… this made no sense. There was no reason for Roman Dmitry to lend such a huge amount, and why was Count London even trying to pay off the debt of the nation?</p>
<p>Count London was not a patriot. He was the type to only care about himself, and the rumors going around proved what he was like. Then this had to be fabricated. However, the contents of the document couldn’t be explained.</p>
<p>Jacqueline yelled,</p>
<p>“Do you think I don’t know that it is a forged document? Count London is someone who turns a blind eye to people in trouble. When everyone was starving and complaining of hunger, people were even thrown out of their jobs due to a dispute with the upper-class people. Even after making so much money, he did nothing for the people. He didn’t give a little bit, and he invited you to a grand party and enjoyed things we couldn’t.”</p>
<p>The party that day was what ticked them off. The luxury that Count London was enjoying could no longer be tolerated.</p>
<p>Right, so Roman asked,</p>
<p>“The authenticity has been confirmed by the Golden Bank. Rather, I have something to ask you. Just like how your claim that he was trying to siphon the money elsewhere has been proven to be false, where is the evidence about Count London being the traitor that you spoke of?”</p>
<p>At that, Jacqueline’s eyes trembled.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Count London. Where did his reputation come from? It wasn’t that he intentionally did it. In a situation where rumors spread around the world, he just didn’t deny them.</p>
<p>It started with the work of Baron Dread, his competitor. Baron Dread had a fight with Count London over the rights of the commercials in the capital, but when he was defeated in the financial battle, he came up with a plan.</p>
<p>His reputation had to be changed. The Count’s father was known to be a patriot, but his son, who succeeded him, didn’t show any signs similar to his. So rumors spread about him being trash. At the same time, Baron Dread released money to the public to look good.</p>
<p>It was a nice plan. Baron Dread went out in the mornings to give out food to the people, and then he won the hearts of the people by showing a false smile, and with that, the rumors spread that Baron Dread was the one for the Redford Kingdom.</p>
<p>If only it had stopped there, Count London might not have gone after Baron Dread, but the man had done so many evil things that it was horrible—human trafficking and drugs. He got involved on the wrong side and was selling people to the empire to get a nice relationship with the Kronos Empire.</p>
<p>Actually, Baron Dread’s reputation wouldn’t have lasted that long. With time, the truth would have come out, but before that, Count London broke him down, and that made him the villain.</p>
<p>Common people thought that Baron Dread was a good person, and Count London, who had taken down a good man, got criticized.</p>
<p>The rumor that he was a traitor began from there. In fact, he didn’t even try to sell the nation or harm it, yet the people would never stop criticizing the poor man.</p>
<p>One year, then two years. As the years passed, people began to become more sure of it. Even if he acted like a normal merchant, people would still call him greedy.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“Has Count London ever done anything that deserves for him to be called evil? A quarrel with Baron Dread cannot be called an evil act. Just like how you compete with others at work, it is a common thing, and Count London was the one who settled the debts that Baron Dread left. Why did you think he did it? Did he care about how you, people, see him? No. He didn’t care about what he was called since the people were already pointing at him, but considering the circumstances of the people who were tormented by Baron Dread, he made a decision to do it.”</p>
<p>The truth was right in front of his eyes. The people were blinded. Some might say he cheated, or some might say he didn’t explain anything.</p>
<p>However, was that even valid? Before making hasty judgments, there had to be some truth to them. A little digging into Baron Dread would have shown how bad he was, and Count London followed the right path.</p>
<p>How the hell could he be evil, then? People labeled everything he did as mean. Count London’s reputation had already been built.</p>
<p>“If anyone presents clear evidence of how he is a traitor, I will release Jacqueline here. Why did you call him trash? Because he is rich? Because he threw a party? He was using what was his. Even if he only cares about his own interests, you, people, have no right to criticize him for doing what he wants with his own money, saying he didn’t give himself up for you.”</p>
<p>Prejudice limits people’s thoughts. Yu Hyun and Count London—just as they thought the other person needed help because they were poor and thought that they would just happily receive the help, the people of Redford believed that the riches of Count London were their right and that any additional money must mean he did something wrong.</p>
<p>Both cases were illusions. The world that the two lived in was different from another. In the same situation, if one chooses a good deed, the other chooses a bad deed.</p>
<p>“I will ask again. Is Count London really the traitor you are talking about?”</p>
<p>At those words, everyone was confused.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman was right. Could Count London be the traitor? He was called wicked because of Baron Dread, who showed kindness to the people, and no matter what the man did, people hated him.</p>
<p>Actually, that was why Jacqueline rioted. Count London had a lot of money, and the man was only using it on himself, and all the citizens now looked shocked.</p>
<p>The attack on the carriage and the murder of innocent people. Even in the face of death, the reason they moved forward was that London was a bad man, but now everything had changed.</p>
<p>And now they had turned into murderers. They had become beings who blindly followed the rumors and didn’t care about the truth. However, the truth before their eyes changed everything.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was someone who settled Redford’s debts. Count London was trying to help the nation and not run away, yet he was punished. Their faith in their actions was shattered.</p>
<p>However, no one could accept that. The moment they put down their weapons, they didn’t have the confidence to take responsibility for the mistakes they had made. It was then….</p>
<p>“There is this place called Annabelle Orphanage in Redford. Everyone probably knows it. Annabelle, who manages a place for homeless kids and helps those in need, is called the hero of Redford, like Jacqueline. But did you think about where the wealth of the orphanage comes from? Annabelle is a commoner. Isn’t it strange for her to have had the resources to help people for so many years?”</p>
<p>The actions of the evil man were questioned again. People considered the orphanage a sanctuary.</p>
<p>At that moment, they were dumbfounded. Why bring up that topic now? When the ominous thoughts began to creep into them slowly, Roman said,</p>
<p>“The sponsor of the Annabelle Orphanage. It is Count London, whom you accuse of being trash.”</p>
<p>The hidden truth—it was a story different from what they saw or heard.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 223 - The Land Of Awakened Blind (2)</p>
<p>The recent remarks were completely different from what they knew. Contrary to the rumors, Count London was not a traitor, and Roman Dmitry might really have settled the debts of their kingdom. That alone was shocking.</p>
<p>At a time when accepting that innocent soldiers were killed at their hands made them breathless, hearing about the Annabelle Orphanage was too much.</p>
<p>Annabelle, who was she? At first, she just provided food for the children who lost their homes, but at some point, people asked if she was running an orphanage as the number of kids she was looking after had increased.</p>
<p>Thus, the orphanage came into existence naturally. Anabelle didn’t only hesitate to look after the kids, but she would also help starving people.</p>
<p>The Saint of Redford—people adored her. Even when the King of the nation abandoned the security of the nation, she didn’t. So they couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>The people looked so lost as they mumbled,</p>
<p>“… Count London is the benefactor of the Annabelle Orphanage?”</p>
<p>“No way. There is no way someone like that traitor would help out that place.”</p>
<p>Actually, the way the orphanage came into existence made no sense. At first, she was just giving food away, but as time went by, the good deeds she was doing began to go beyond what normal people could afford.</p>
<p>The people also had their doubts, yet even though they knew it didn’t make any sense, they didn’t bother digging for the truth.</p>
<p>Whatever the reason, it didn’t change the fact that she helped people. No matter how chaotic the world was, they wanted to believe blindly that a kind person existed in Redford.</p>
<p>However, if the traitor was supporting it, they couldn’t handle the truth that was revealed. While people would talk about how great Annabelle was, they would also talk about how Count London was ruining the nation.</p>
<p>And so the riots occurred. It was Jacqueline who spoke up first, but then everyone agreed to take up arms because the opponent was Count London. Everyone was silent, as they were all too shocked.</p>
<p>Then a person in a robe stepped forward.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The person in a robe walked forward, and the people groaned. The face revealed from under the robe was that of the Saint of Redford.</p>
<p>“… Miss Annabelle. Are Roman Dmitry’s words true? Please say that they aren’t. Prove to everyone that Count London, who is accused of being a traitor to this nation, has never helped the orphanage.”</p>
<p>A person asked. They were desperate not to fall into guilt, but Annabelle shook her head with a sad expression.</p>
<p>“Everything Mr. Roman Dmitry said is true. So put down the weapons you are holding.”</p>
<p>The citizens hesitated. Even after the truth was revealed, they couldn’t put down their weapons to protect their lives.</p>
<p>“I am not half the great person you think of me as. I couldn’t look away from the starving kids, so I shared a little food with them, but then one day, Count London came to visit me. He said that he noticed my good deeds and that if I was willing to take care of people, he would fund the expenses each month. It is the truth about the orphanage that you people don’t know.”</p>
<p>There was no doubt that she was a good person. Good deeds must be backed up with a nice personality, but reality isn’t something that hits you just because of the personality you have.</p>
<p>“Running an orphanage is not easy. If I didn’t have money to buy food for the kids, it wouldn’t work. And if I couldn’t solve the problems of people who needed my help, it wouldn’t work. I wouldn’t have been able to devote myself to the duty in the way you remember me. Because I, like all of you, was someone who couldn’t live in reality. In fact, I wanted to tell the truth about the accusations against Count London. The man sent food and money to the orphanage to help people and didn’t stop even when people called him a traitor.”</p>
<p>The more she spoke, the more tears welled up. Looking at the bewildered people, she recalled her interactions with Count London.</p>
<p>“The title of Saint of Redford is too much for me. If it weren’t for that man, I wouldn’t even be here. When I asked him why he wasn’t telling the truth, he would always say that ‘someone’ doing the task is more important than ‘who’ is doing it. Had I known that you people would attack him, I would have spoken the truth even if he stopped me. Because he wasn’t someone who deserved to be treated like that. The people may not have known the truth, but he deserves all the things in life. That… that is what it should be.”</p>
<p>She didn’t blame the people since they didn’t know the truth. But still, she couldn’t hide the anger in her voice. She was an ordinary woman. People turned her into someone great, but she would never be in that position if not for Count London.</p>
<p>After the riot was over, the children ran to the orphanage with bright faces. Each kid showed a gold coin in their hand and asked Annabelle, who was taking care of them, to accept it with a smile. Such warm hearts.</p>
<p>If she had known that the source of the coins was Count London’s blood, Annabelle wouldn’t have smiled at them. And when she heard the truth, the world collapsed.</p>
<p>When people said they were going to attack, she went to see Count London. And Roman Dmitry, whom she met there, told her what she should do for Count London’s sake.</p>
<p>Annabelle said,</p>
<p>“We all made a huge mistake. Everyone who didn’t see the truth, and I, who didn’t tell the truth despite knowing it. Do not do anything you will regret. Count London, whom you called a traitor, is a man who cared for the kingdom a lot more than anyone else, and if Roman Dmitry came to help at Count London’s request, it is your last chance. Stop, put down your weapons.”</p>
<p>And she ended with that. The people went silent as if they were hypnotized.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>And it was Roman Dmitry who broke the silence.</p>
<p>“The day you people came to the mansion to attack Count London, I asked him this. Why don’t you tell the truth? The poverty of this kingdom isn’t the responsibility of the London family, and you are being called a traitor, so why bother helping the people of the kingdom?”</p>
<p>On that day, he said that in the era of hatred and in this harsh reality, in order for the kingdom not to collapse, it was necessary to have someone who could accept the people’s criticism.</p>
<p>“He knew the truth coming out would lessen the accusations against him, but he didn’t do it. In the era of hatred, if someone deserves to be criticized, it is not a noble but the King. He knew that the riot today would turn the nation upside down.”</p>
<p>He looked at Jacqueline. From the moment Annabelle appeared, Jacqueline couldn’t come to his senses.</p>
<p>“Jacqueline. Was this riot purely your intention? Even though it was a secret that even insiders didn’t know that the gold coins were loaded in the carriage to solve the problem with the Golden Bank, you were waiting for the carriage and knew exactly where it was moving. That information—who told you about it? And is the person who told you the information still here?”</p>
<p>“… What?!”</p>
<p>Jacqueline’s eyes went wide. Come to think of it, a strange thing did happen. He was just complaining like any other day, but the owner of the bar was the one who raised the remarks and incited them. It was the same when they visited Count London’s mansion.</p>
<p>His words against Roman Dmitry made him fear that a fight would happen. And now, the owner of the bar was nowhere to be found. He, who told him of the route of the carriage, disappeared like an illusion from the moment the gold coins had been robbed.</p>
<p>“The one who told you about it might have already disappeared. You people had the chance to look at the truth. The fact that the source of the information felt strange and the fact that normal people had taken down aura swordsmen and escort soldiers. If you had thought even for a second, you would have realized how strange it was. The meaning of the series of events is clear. There were people aiming for Redford’s chaos, and you had taken their side. Even though Count London is a person who cared about the nation more than anyone else, from your decision, innocent soldiers were killed, and Count London bled.”</p>
<p>The truth was harsh—100,000 gold, Annabelle, and the fact that they were played—and people couldn’t come to their senses. It turned out that the thing they were happy about—the robbery they were happy about—had plunged the nation into the abyss.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“I will ask you one last time. Is Jacqueline someone who can be called the hero of Redford?”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Was that what it felt like to stop an accident? The people were silent. Until a few minutes ago, they were angry.</p>
<p>It was right to attack Count London, and they gathered a force to defeat Roman Dmitry, who tried to touch the hero of Redford.</p>
<p>People flocked to the square. The people who had a hard time every day due to starvation now had glistening eyes with the murderous intent of having their gold taken away. But the truth was different.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry and Count London. The fact that they were doing things differently from what they had been thinking made the people weak.</p>
<p><em>Clang!</em></p>
<p><em>Clack!</em></p>
<p>The weapons dropped, and so did their anger. They could no longer raise their weapons and face Roman Dmitry. Their faces were red, and they realized how foolishly they had acted.</p>
<p>And at the center was Jacqueline. He, who had led them into this, felt like he was losing track of reality.</p>
<p>‘…I got played. What the hell did I do?’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s words made his heart clench. He had the chance to see the truth. People accused Count London of being a traitor, but whenever something happened, he always brought in some people to help. Yet the first reaction he received was hostility.</p>
<p>He thought he was exploiting the labor force, but in terms of his attitude and treatment towards the workers, they were given undeserved care. At that time, when Jacqueline had asked what life was like there, a servant of the Count said,</p>
<p>“To be honest, I am quite happy with my life with the London family. I know I will be beaten for saying this, but the Count isn’t as bad as people think. He cares for the people and treats his servants with more respect than anyone else. So don’t hate him. No matter how the world sees him, we know he is a kind person.”</p>
<p>They were absurd words. Everyone accused him of being a traitor, but the servants of the London family said something else. Maybe it was the price of comfort. Since they weren’t starving there, the servants might have liked being there.</p>
<p>He had seen the truth, listened to the truth, and experienced the truth. There were beings who knew the truth without telling it, but unlike them, Jacqueline turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>The day he attended the party, even with food to feed his wife, he went to the pub and complained. Maybe it was an inferiority complex because they were enjoying things that he couldn’t. At that moment…</p>
<p>“… Ah.”</p>
<p>Suddenly, he looked at his hands. The red traces, which he thought were right, began to scare him.</p>
<p>As Roman Dmitry had said, he made an irreparable mistake.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 224 - The Land Of Awakened Blind (3)</p>
<p>Jacqueline covered his face. He was sobbing with his body trembling, and he couldn’t stop crying at the emotions that had taken over him.</p>
<p>“… I am sorry. I am really sorry. I never thought that Count London was someone who worked so hard for us. No, I never thought of it. Everyone called him a traitor, and so I thought the same.”</p>
<p>Born into a commoner family, Jacqueline lived a life not different from others. Rather than planning for the future, their immediate life was a priority, and as they lived like that, making a family and taking the burden of the kids turned into all of their life. It was a reality that wasn’t nice.</p>
<p>Knowing that the reality wouldn’t change despite thinking about it, he only felt more dissatisfied with his life. So he became narrow-minded, and his vision began to turn less. The success stories of other people turned into something far from reality.</p>
<p>“<em>Euk,</em> what am I supposed to do now? Please tell me, I am not sure what to do. Even after doing such a thing, it is difficult for me to accept this situation.”</p>
<p>He was a commoner. He became the hero of Redford by chance, but he wasn’t able to lead the people because he was special. It was because the people sympathized with Jacqueline because they were the same. The target that was used was Jacquline, but honestly, anyone could have taken on that role.</p>
<p>His face was stained with tears. After checking the reality with Roman Dmitry, Jacqueline’s face distorted as the world he knew collapsed. As an ordinary person who lived a repeated life, he didn’t have the experience to accept the series of events.</p>
<p>He felt lost. He sobbed and cried, not caring how the people looked at him. Silence began to descend, and the people couldn’t say anything. They neither blamed Jacqueline nor comforted him because they were no different from him.</p>
<p>They projected themselves onto Jacqueline and eventually left the judgment of the situation to Roman Dmitry, who said,</p>
<p>“Jacqueline, you have your own story. The riot that attacked the mansion wasn’t for personal gain, and you, who robbed the gold coins, distributed them to the people, proving what you took up arms for. But…”</p>
<p><em>Schwing.</em></p>
<p>The sword was lifted. Despite how shocked people were, he pointed his sword at Jacqueline’s throat.</p>
<p>“There is no reason that can be an excuse for your actions. You incited and attacked the carriage of Count London, killing innocent soldiers. They also had families. Even if you raised a riot for your family because of your misunderstanding, the soldiers’ families lost their sons and fathers. What do you think you will pay them back with? Even if you cry, those who died cannot come back.”</p>
<p>He looked at the people. This wasn’t about Jacqueline. The opponent might be Jacqueline, but Roman Dmitry was saying that to all who participated in the riot.</p>
<p>“The water has been spilled. In order for Redford to avoid repeating the same thing, the responsibility for the actions that you took cannot be simply considered a mistake and pardoned. You are not the ‘Hero of Redford.’ Jacqueline, you are a murderer who committed murder by mistake and will be held accountable.”</p>
<p>Jacqueline closed his eyes tightly. He was ready to accept his death. His body was trembling, and it proved he was human, but the blood of the Count on his hands was true.</p>
<p>Because of his one mistake, a person who had devoted his life to helping the kingdom almost died. If he had hit the Count a little harder, the man would have never gotten up. He was the enemy here. He did what his real enemy wouldn’t do.</p>
<p>“Citizens of Redford, listen up. Remember what happened today. Jacqueline is not a hero of Redford but will remain as one who accepted his death for his sins. Later, when you make the same mistake, think of him. There is no one to take your place for your wrong actions.”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>The sword was swung.</p>
<p>A man who was too normal to be called a hero—just like that, Jacqueline fell with blood flowing.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>At that time, Count London led the troops to the Royal Palace. He didn’t want the bloodshed to throw the nation into chaos, but there was no other way.</p>
<p>‘The people’s anger had reached its peak. Right now, it is just about attacking me, a noble, but if the core of the problem isn’t solved, it will be hard to predict what chaos will happen in the future. After all, the future of the Redford Kingdom will be at stake. Someone must take up arms and bring the King down.’</p>
<p>Even while walking, his mind felt so messed up. Currently, he had agreed to overthrow the King, but Roman Dmitry wanted him to usurp the throne, and that was a different matter.</p>
<p>The King had a Prince who was concerned for the kingdom. When he thought of the Prince, who spoke about rebelling for the nation, he wondered if following Roman’s words was right.</p>
<p>Under the same sky, the blood of the royal family would not be different. If they wanted to destroy the King and claim the throne, they had to take the life of the Prince.</p>
<p>‘For what am I rebelling for?’</p>
<p>A single purpose. If one soberly judged reality, the Prince didn’t fit the role. In a turbulent world, someone was needed to sort out the chaotic situation, but the years have proven that the Prince wasn’t that great.</p>
<p>He also asked the Count to start the rebellion. It was like admitting that he didn’t have the strength to do it despite knowing that the King was in the wrong.</p>
<p>So from the choices that were given, he knew what he had to do. The moment he stormed into the palace with weapons, from then on, his hesitation would ruin everything.</p>
<p>‘I am sorry, Prince.’</p>
<p>The choice should belong to a leader. For those who followed him, Count London would not be shaken.</p>
<p>“Knight Commander.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“The moment we enter the palace, we will ask to have a talk. If the Royal Knights, who follow the King, act hostile towards us, then without hesitation, bring down the head of the Royal Knight’s Commander and subdue their troops at once. Keep that in mind. In the end, this is a fight that will decide Redford’s fate. If we cannot achieve results in the process, Redford will fall into destruction.”</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<p>The Knight Commander looked confused. The Knights of London and the Royal Knights were close friends, but he didn’t show any hesitation at the order of the Count.</p>
<p>It was something he had hoped for. Looking at the Count and his devotion to the people, the people who knew him wondered if things would be different if this man were the King of Redford.</p>
<p>Finally, they reached the Royal Palace. However, the guard opened the door like he was waiting for them.</p>
<p>“Please go inside.”</p>
<p>Beyond their gaze were the Royal Knights, and when they saw Count London, they all knelt down.</p>
<p>“The Royal Knights of Redford protect the royal family. We know that it is treason to oppose the King, but we made the decision to set things right for the nation. We will close our eyes and ears this time. So get what you want. Do what you need to for the nation—for Redford.”</p>
<p>Count London’s decision—those from the London family weren’t the only ones who wanted it.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The people in the Royal Palace—they heard about the stories. People called Count London a traitor, but the contents of the information that reached the palace were different.</p>
<p>The hope of Redford. In the face of a financial downturn, Count London devoted himself to the nation to the point where the vast fortune he earned was exhausted.</p>
<p>It was a move that couldn’t be compared to that of a King. Unlike the King, who was gambling these days and enjoying himself with women, Count London took the job of the King.</p>
<p>And so, the door opened. Despite knowing the meaning of the Royal Sword’s existence and knowing that a single disregard would reduce its value, the Royal Knight Commander turned a blind eye.</p>
<p>Even though he couldn’t join the rebellion, he decided this was the right move for the kingdom to prevent as much bloodshed as possible and make Count London take the throne.</p>
<p>And thanks to this, Count London was able to cross the path safely. He walked down the long corridor, which he always used whenever he reported to the King, and the armed troops followed him.</p>
<p>Today, how would it be remembered? Some would call him a traitor who caused a rebellion, but history’s record didn’t matter.</p>
<p>A man called a traitor. For Count London, the priority had always been Redford. No matter what he was called, he did what he thought was right.</p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened. When the knights of the family opened the way, Count London stepped into the King’s space with a hard expression.</p>
<p>At that moment, Count London’s face was stained with shock.</p>
<p>He looked at the throne that he had always looked up to.</p>
<p>The King of Redford, with his head dropped, had a pale face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A pale face and blood dripping from his mouth. The King was dead. It was an unacceptable piece of information, and Count London found a suicide note left by the King.</p>
<p>[Count London, after hearing that you were attacked, I couldn’t hold back the anger towards myself because the chaos was caused by me. And despite knowing that you were loyal to our nation, anger rose over the days I ignored it.]</p>
<p>It was strange. The content of the will was different from what people thought of the King.</p>
<p>[Actually, I wanted to live valiantly. People say the death of my children was an accident, but behind it was a group of evil people who threatened the safety of Redford. It wasn’t enough that they killed my eldest son. They even killed my daughter, and one day they sent me a letter. Their threat was that from that point on, if I didn’t gamble each day and live a spoiled life, my remaining son would be killed. Actually, my second child had been poisoned before. You might not know this because I continued to feed him the antidote they had given each time, and each time I acted for the nation, one of my family members would die.]</p>
<p>The hidden truth. There was information in the will that even Count London hadn’t known about.</p>
<p>[I am an incompetent King. I didn’t fulfill my duty as a King or as the father of my children. I just acted selfishly. But now I know that it shouldn’t have been like that. If I became greedier in order to protect my children, many people in Redford would lose their lives. Count London, you are the leader that Redford needs. If I step down from the throne, the nation will gain stability under your leadership. Don’t get my blood on your hands. I will take my own life so that the evil people will no longer threaten me. So, I ask for this nation that I had destroyed to be saved.]</p>
<p>“… What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>His hand holding the note trembled. Count London gritted his teeth and read the last words.</p>
<p>[Lastly, I hope you don’t force the life out of the Prince. After all, he is a child with not much left around him.]</p>
<p>That was it. Count London held the will. It was the same. Just as Jacqueline didn’t know the truth about him, he didn’t know the truth about the King.</p>
<p>It felt so irresponsible. Even if he died like this, the wrongdoings committed by the King wouldn’t disappear. However, as Count London, there was something he had to do.</p>
<p>“Find the Prince right now! You must let him know about this.”</p>
<p>In his remaining life, even if that time was short, Count London wanted the Prince to know the truth about the King who was accused by the people.</p>
<p>Even if he was incompetent, the King had been a father to him.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 225 - The Land Of Awakened Blind (4)</p>
<p>It didn’t take too long to find the Prince. As usual, the Prince was in his place, and Count London told him the truth of what he had witnessed with a complicated look on his face.</p>
<p>“A little while ago, His Majesty, the King, passed away.”</p>
<p>Redford’s last heir, Charlo Redford, said with a calm face,</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“… You knew about it?”</p>
<p>“My father came to me and told me the truth of why he lived like that. He said that the royal family must fulfill its responsibility before Redford falls into the abyss. He said it in a roundabout way, but in the end, it meant that this nation could survive if I and my brother died.”</p>
<p>He drank tea. Smelling the sweet scent, Charlo Redford looked at the shocked Count London.</p>
<p>“You don’t need to look so taken aback, even if my father didn’t tell you. I knew his secret from the start. The deaths of my brother and sister weren’t normal. While looking at me with pity, I was convinced that there was a conspiracy in the series of events that happened, seeing my father gambling and an alcoholic going after women, and it was as I had expected. As I closely watched the surroundings, I noticed the servants were adding something to my food. It was an element to detoxify my body, and if so, I arrived at the conclusion that my father acted out with the intention to save my life.”</p>
<p>“Why didn’t you tell me if you knew the truth?”</p>
<p>“Because talking about it wouldn’t change anything. Count London. An evil group of people is doing their best to kill the heirs of the royal family and threaten my father with my life. What should I do? Because I have been poisoned by someone and my life is at stake, is it right to ask for favors? How would that look?”</p>
<p>Even telling the truth wouldn’t solve the problem. The moment the magicians declared he couldn’t be cured, Charlo Redford and his coming death would be known to all. Despite knowing that, the King couldn’t let go of the last child he had. Having lost two of his kids, he couldn’t see the last one go.</p>
<p>Count London said,</p>
<p>“… Prince, you spoke of the rebellion. Despite knowing the truth, you still wanted to do it?”</p>
<p>“Is there anything else that could be done? My father cannot give up his life as such, and I couldn’t harm him directly. Then the only way for Redford to survive is for us to die. So I asked you to start a rebellion. Merely stepping down from the throne wouldn’t solve the problem. The power must be fully transferred into the hands of the right person, and it would be a problem if a person with royal blood survived. So I hoped you would raise your sword. Count London is the right person to inherit the throne. Knowing the years you have devoted yourself to Redford, I thought the Count would be ready to make the right decision.”</p>
<p>To bring the King down from the throne, what if Charlo Redford died from the poison? Count London would naturally inherit the vacant seat from Charlo Redford, and that was the Prince’s plan. Knowing the truth, he risked his life to protect the nation.</p>
<p>“But my father moved first. When he came and told me the truth, he tried to be as calm as possible when he sentenced himself to death. I looked at my father and showed him a face that I didn’t know what he was saying. That way, Father would have a bit of an unburdened mind.”</p>
<p>Charlo Redford—people judged him unworthy of the throne. Even though he wasn’t born with the ability to rule others, he accepted his destiny as a member of the royal family.</p>
<p>Maybe he would have been fit to be King. Had he accumulated experience and years of guidance, Charlo Redford would have been a nice King. However, the reality wasn’t like that. The turbulent times weren’t nice for the young man, so the royal heir had to accept his own death.</p>
<p>Count London bowed his head, unable to look at the prince. Just like how he shouldered the burden of the kingdom, the thought of the burden this child had been keeping made him emotional.</p>
<p>Charlo Redford said,</p>
<p>“Lastly, there is something I want to ask Count London. Please do not make our deaths in vain. Please bring Redford back to life and take revenge on the evil ones who threw our nation into chaos. If you can promise that much, I will accept my death with a smile.”</p>
<p>At that, Count London nodded his head. No words of comfort were said. Since he couldn’t speak right now, he just nodded, holding back his emotions.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ten days later, Charlo Redford closed his eyes. The deadly poison began to flare up, and he became a weak man and ended his life with a frail appearance, unlike the dignified life he had.</p>
<p>In his last moments, he showed a bit of will to live. If it weren’t for his status as the Prince, he would have struggled to live but decided to stay silent about his wishes for the sake of the future.</p>
<p>Well, he knew that if he left with regrets or spoke the wrong words, he would make the path tough for Count London.</p>
<p>It was such a gloomy day. On a day with dark clouds and heavy rain, a public funeral was held for the Prince.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>A fire broke out. The two corpses laid in the center of a tall tree, and the flames of magic burned everything red.</p>
<p>A lot of people watched that scene, and they lined up behind Count London. They had forgotten about their mistakes and showed courtesy to the royal family.</p>
<p>The King and the Prince—the cause of their deaths was disclosed publicly. The King took his life to not succumb to the threats any longer, and the Prince died from the clutches of an evil group.</p>
<p>Redford resented the King. His crime that plunged their nation into the abyss deserved punishment, but the story of the evil group spread a lot of angry flames. And that was what Count London was aiming for.</p>
<p>In order to raise the kingdom from its shaky foundation, it was necessary for everyone to know the existence of their enemies.</p>
<p>The ruin of their nation, bringing the royal family to their deaths, and the existence that used Jacqueline—as words spread that it was the Kronos Empire, the people’s anger was great.</p>
<p>‘… Your Majesty, Prince Charlo.’</p>
<p>Count London looked at the flames with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>At last, Redford had their own story. The King had his own story, and the Prince had his own story, along with Jacqueline. If only people were a little more honest with each other. There might have been a chance to solve the problems, but the wrong choices continued to be made.</p>
<p>But Count London lived by his own story. Even though he was accused of being the traitor, he thought he had shouldered the burden of the kingdom, and as Jacqueline attacked him based on what he saw, he also attacked the King on what he saw.</p>
<p>It wasn’t like the King’s actions were lies, but the fact that he knew the truth only after death was what remained in his heart.</p>
<p>‘Redford will not fall like this. We will create a nation that constantly doubts the truth in front of us, listens to what people say, and will not collapse to the plans of the evil ones like Kronos, and more importantly, I will get my revenge.’</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth as he looked at the burning flame. Count London turned around and spoke to the Royal Knight, who was now following him.</p>
<p>“The coronation ceremony will be held in a few days. Pick a place and tell the people.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Leave the dead behind.</p>
<p>From now on, it was his turn to live for the living.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Usually, a government secured by a rebellion isn’t supported by the people. But it was different for Count London. With the royal family’s death, people naturally appointed Count London as their new King.</p>
<p>It was not a throne won by a rebellion. It was obvious that Count London led his troops to the palace to visit the King, but since the people of the palace spoke about it outside, no one even bothered to protest.</p>
<p>Rather, they liked it. Who was Count London? The person who devoted himself to the Redford Kingdom. And with the years of calling him a traitor, the guilt that was in their hearts turned into cheers.</p>
<p>“Your Majesty! Congratulations!”</p>
<p>“Woahhhhh!”</p>
<p>“Redford!”</p>
<p>“Redford!”</p>
<p>People flocked to the palace. At the place where the new King was being enthroned, they cheered.</p>
<p>Count London—no, the King of Redford—looked at the people.</p>
<p>‘The people I will rule from now on.’</p>
<p>Ten days ago, with everything wrapped up, Roman Dmitry said these last words before leaving,</p>
<p>“Count London. Now that the truth has been revealed, people will cheer for you as if they never criticized you. They will show blind loyalty to you, but do not attach great importance to these changes. Those who called you a traitor, those who raised their voices saying they respected you, and those who took part in the riot in front of your home—all of them are people of Redford. What they will look like depends on how you rule. In fact, it cannot be ruled out that the fact that they didn’t see the truth of their noble leader is the fault of the one who created such an environment. Keep that in mind.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s words were engraved into his chest. The King of Redford raised his hand, forgetting the past.</p>
<p>And cheers erupted.</p>
<p>Redford would not repeat the mistakes of the past.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When Redford faced a period of upheaval, Roman returned to Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘If Redford regains stability, then Dmitry will have a strong ally.’</p>
<p>Count London said he would build a nation. And if they went to war with the Kronos Empire in the future, they would do their best to get their revenge.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a bad result. The Kingdoms’ Alliance, which had been on the verge of collapsing, regained stability, and Redford would treat Dmitry as its lifelong benefactor.</p>
<p>Roman organized his thoughts about Redford. From now on, it was up to them. The most important issue in the future was to ensure Dmitry wouldn’t be shaken.</p>
<p>For a few days, he wouldn’t travel.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry called Chris.</p>
<p>“Chris. We will leave for the Valhalla Empire in the future. At that time, it will be impossible to bring all of Dmitry’s forces. In Valhalla and also in Dmitry, we never know what will happen, so the soldiers need to train for a battle without me in case of an emergency. For the time being, cancel any other schedules and proceed with the special training.”</p>
<p>“Anything else?”</p>
<p>“No. Just tell them to get a good rest and prepare for training. This time, it will be tough.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Chris nodded. So far, Dmitry’s training has always been intense. But when Roman said it would be tough, he couldn’t help but mumble,</p>
<p>“… It will be huge.”</p>
<p>Not for Cairo, but the man called the next Lord of Dmitry was talking about training, which made them sweat.</p>
<p>Time passed, and before they knew it, the deadline Valhalla spoke of arrived.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 226 - Valhalla Kingdom (1)</p>
<p>Around that time, a rumor was spreading about Roman Dmitry all over the continent.</p>
<p>“Did you hear the rumor?”</p>
<p>“What rumor?”</p>
<p>“The Valhalla Empire is holding a festival to honor the souls of warriors again this year, and they chose Roman Dmitry as the opponent for Barbossa, the Twelve Swords of the Continent. It means that the Valhalla Empire acknowledged Roman Dmitry’s existence. If Barbossa is defeated, the continent’s first highest Ranker, excluding the empire, will be born.”</p>
<p>At first, there was news informing people of what had happened. Word spread quickly among the people that Roman Dmitry was dealing with Barbossa, but at some point, the contents of the rumor changed a little.</p>
<p>Despite getting the invitation, Roman Dmitry hadn’t responded yet, and the slight delay fueled questions about Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“He must be scared.”</p>
<p>“He must be. He is a completely different swordsman from what Roman Dmitry has dealt with so far. Even though he defeated Continental Rankers like Butler, Count Nicholas, and Gustavo, they were definitely lower Rankers. In fact, even if they attacked at the same time, Barbossa would not be defeated. It is clear that Roman Dmitry is talented, but dealing with that man is impossible.”</p>
<p>“As expected, people talk about Roman Dmitry as if he is the best talent on the continent, but the continent is full of monsters worse than him. Roman Dmitry is just a frog in a well.”</p>
<p>The people expressed their disappointment.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—the reason he was immediately recognized by the people was because he had never avoided fighting. In the fight that started with Homer and so on, Roman Dmitry was the underdog every time, but contrary to the expectations of the people, he proved himself by defeating the opponents.</p>
<p>However, this time, he didn’t move to fight. He understood the opponent, but they couldn’t help but feel disappointed with his different attitude from the past.</p>
<p>The rumors escalated, with words mocking Roman Dmitry. Even though there was still quite a bit of time left before the festival, people were thinking that Roman Dmitry had escaped.</p>
<p>And such rumors soon reached Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>‘Valhalla is blatantly making their move.’</p>
<p>The intention of the rumors was clear. These rumors didn’t escalate normally, but it was Valhalla that was leading this situation in this manner.</p>
<p>If Roman Dmitry agreed to the fight, they would inform the people that Roman Dmitry would fall from Barbossa, and they would raise the status of their empire using a revenge story.</p>
<p>Conversely, if he refused, rumors would spread, tarnishing his reputation. People would ridicule Roman Dmitry’s choice of avoiding the fight, as the rumors say, and it would only be a matter of time before people would consider him a coward.</p>
<p>Valhalla had its methods. Even though the fight between Roman Dmitry and Barbossa made no sense, they deliberately did that and laid a plan that Roman Dmitry would have a hard time refusing.</p>
<p>The situation—Roman Dmitry didn’t like Valhalla’s intentions.</p>
<p>Did they create the situation? Did they do so by spreading rumors? No.</p>
<p>From the start, Roman was going to accept the invitation, but their confidence in Barbossa’s victory was annoying him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>That evening, Kevin went to see Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“My Lord, can you tell me why I am excluded from the party going to Valhalla?”</p>
<p>During the trip to Valhalla, soldiers, including Chris, were included. The rest would stay in Dmitry, but the problem was that Kevin was in the Dmitry group.</p>
<p>Kevin, as usual, didn’t speak against Roman. He wouldn’t even hesitate if Roman asked him to jump into the fire now, but he felt a little confused this time. It was like he was excluded from the people he could trust.</p>
<p>Going to Valhalla was full of risk, but despite knowing that, Roman didn’t want to take him.</p>
<p>The special training in preparation for Valhalla—Kevin stubbornly went through it. He endured it all to help Roman Dmitry, so being excluded from the party wasn’t something he had expected.</p>
<p>He could accept it if Roman said he couldn’t trust Kevin’s skills. It was true that Chris was stronger, and he even felt angry about it, but he wasn’t going to fail his Lord. However, he just wanted to know the reason.</p>
<p>At Kevin’s question, Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“This trip to Valhalla will be a dangerous one. Kronos and Valhalla. For those seeking to take their revenge on me, this public departure to Valhalla is a golden chance to take my life. All of them will definitely move. I know they will try to hurt me in one way or another, but I have no choice but to accept the plan that Valhalla has set for me.”</p>
<p>It wasn’t a compelling reason. His reputation didn’t matter, and Roman was already willing to go to Valhalla right from the start.</p>
<p>“In the future war, we will have to win impossible fights. We did well until now, but dealing with empires like Kronos is a different thing. Then, how would the soldiers react to meeting the Twelve Swords on the battlefield? The value of the name and title they hold will shrink their morale, and fear will spread. Therefore, only one thing is needed. To show them that the Twelve Swords aren’t absolute and make them believe that even the Kingdoms’ Alliance, including Dmitry, can defeat them, I decided this is necessary.”</p>
<p>Barbossa would be the stepping stone for that. It wouldn’t simply end with leaping to a higher rank by defeating someone that strong, but it would serve as a reason to boost the morale of the soldiers in the future war.</p>
<p>A war couldn’t be won alone. Even if Roman Dmitry was one in a hundred, his win would be a win for all those who followed him. And now that he was leaving for Valhalla, Roman Dmitry had an obvious reason for leaving Kevin behind.</p>
<p>“The risks of this schedule are not limited to me. The fact that I will be exposed to danger from enemies after leaving Dmitry can also be interpreted as Dmitry being in danger without me. That is why I need someone I can trust to remain here. Kevin, I have decided that you are the right person for that. If, by any chance, the enemies come up with some plan, the person who will produce the best results on the battlefield without me is you, Kevin.”</p>
<p>Telling him that he trusted him was enough—the belief that he, and not Chris, was the one who would produce the best results. His discontent quickly melted away, and Kevin, who looked sad, was now clenching his fist with a determined expression.</p>
<p>“Thank you for trusting me. I will do my best to protect Dmitry.”</p>
<p>His face was bright.</p>
<p>Kevin was a very simple human being.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A few days after that, Roman Dmitry headed for Valhalla with his troops. Even with the Warp Gate, they couldn’t directly go to the capital, so the first place they arrived was a city called Paulo, which was near the border.</p>
<p>There was no problem getting in and out because there was an invitation. But from the moment they entered Paulo, Roman Dmitry and his party felt that Valhalla was different from other nations.</p>
<p>“We will conduct a body search for a moment.”</p>
<p>Paulo’s guards skimmed through the invitation and checked all over their bodies, to the extent that it seemed a bit excessive. Usually, people who came in and out from the front could pass through in just 3 minutes. However, it took more than 30 minutes for them to check their luggage.</p>
<p>Of course, during the search, nothing was found. Their minimum armament was acceptable, so the guards opened the way with disapproving faces. And…</p>
<p>“Do not make a fuss inside since Paulo isn’t a city that welcomes outsiders.”</p>
<p>They spat out words like that in the end. Paulo was just like the guards had said. Inside, there were a lot of people with Valhalla’s unique bronze skin, but when they looked at Roman Dmitry and his party, there was distaste in their eyes. Even the merchants didn’t talk to them, and those walking on the sides turned their faces away.</p>
<p>If…if they were warriors, their reactions would be different. Rather than keeping a distance, clashing shoulders and arguing were what Valhalla was known for.</p>
<p>“As rumored.”</p>
<p>It was Chris. Before leaving for Valhalla, he learned more about the nation he would get to experience in the future.</p>
<p>The Valhalla Empire was a fairly closed nation, and unlike Kronos, which grew by accepting other people, Valhalla formed the basis of the nation by being closed off. Just as the lineage of Valhalla was once maintained through incestuous marriages, they rejected people from other races that were different from Valhalla.</p>
<p>And they soon turned into an empire. Some of them had risen in status, but the essence of the empire didn’t change.</p>
<p>‘The race that is said to be the most difficult opponent on the continent is Valhalla. If one isn’t from Valhalla, it is a world where hostility will be justified, so outsiders aren’t welcomed there.’</p>
<p>There was a saying in the world. If it hadn’t been for Valhalla’s closed culture, they might have surpassed the Kronos Empire. While retaining some of their closed cultures, Valhalla had achieved a mighty power comparable to Kronos.</p>
<p>The problem was that, even knowing that fact, Valhalla didn’t send anyone to guide their guests.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>An inn in Paulo.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry made his party unpack in a place that had a shabby look. The other inns didn’t take in outsiders. So after walking in vain, they were finally able to find a place to rest after saying that they would pay more.</p>
<p>And at the inn’s diner, Roman Dmitry went down and drank a cup of tea, which didn’t smell that good.</p>
<p>‘Apart from inviting us, it must mean that Valhalla just decided not to acknowledge my existence.’</p>
<p>Valhalla was unique. They had a culture that did not acknowledge others unless they had experienced them firsthand. Valhalla didn’t intentionally send anyone. They hoped that Roman Dmitry would prove his existence on his own and arrive in the capital, where the festival was happening. It was interesting.</p>
<p>People’s cold stares and disdainful looks were the experiences of all the outsiders who entered the empire. It was then…</p>
<p>“Ah, the taste of alcohol.”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p>From a table away, a drunken man, who was still drinking, looked at Roman Dmitry with a flushed face. His companions were also clearly dissatisfied. From the moment they first entered the inn, they kept watching Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“I don’t know where you guys are from, but if you are an outsider, go up and sleep quietly. Do not do arrogant things, and try to be with the people of Valhalla when they eat and drink. I get angry at the sight of you people. As if you had no hardships to go through in life, that fucking white skin.”</p>
<p>The drunk people giggled. He messed around in front of Roman Dmitry. There were soldiers and Chris too, but they didn’t seem to care about them.</p>
<p>“Yah! Didn’t you hear?”</p>
<p>They looked at them. Seeing them calmly drinking tea made the drunk people angrier.</p>
<p>“This bastard continues to ignore people. I am telling you to leave. If you keep sitting on your ass here, I will pull you by the hair and send you upstairs. Is that fine?”</p>
<p>In Vahalla, it was the situation they wanted. Racism was commonly experienced by people from other nations. In response to Valhalla’s intentions to examine their reaction, Roman Dmitry put down his teacup.</p>
<p>“Chris.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“From now on, as planned, let the people know that we have arrived in Valhalla.”</p>
<p>“What bullshit is that?!”</p>
<p>A drunk man asked, and at that moment…</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>Chris grabbed the drunk man by his back, and then…</p>
<p><em>Bak!</em></p>
<p>As if to show off to everyone, he slammed his face right into the table.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 227 - Valhalla Kingdom (2)</p>
<p>Valhalla had a saying. Even the pot-bellied man passing on the street must have once been a warrior who drank blood on the battlefield, and this drunkard was like that. His face was slammed into the table with his nose crushed and bleeding, but the drunkard raised his head.</p>
<p>His face was stained with blood. Even though it wouldn’t be strange for most people to fall down and groan in pain, the drunkard spat blood with a distorted face.</p>
<p>“<em>Spit.</em> “</p>
<p>“This bastard hit my head first?!”</p>
<p>There was no need for words, the drunk man rushed and tried to knock Chris down, but Chris dodged with just a step and punched him in the abdomen.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>His eyes went wide. The pain must probably be rising from within him, but the man grunted through his teeth and swung his fist at Chris. He definitely had a toughness and determination that exceeded that of ordinary people. He showed his determination to defeat Chris, but what awaited him was just merciless hands.</p>
<p><em>Pack!</em></p>
<p>With a hit to the side, he slapped his cheek. He kicked the stumbling drunk right in the stomach, and he looked unsightly as he fell down.</p>
<p>“You bastard.”</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>In an instant, everything turned into a mess. The drunken party, which had been watching it while giggling until now, jumped up from their places, realizing the situation was turning serious.</p>
<p>There were three people, and it seemed like each of them was familiar with street fights. The way they swung their fists was quite strong, but with one punch, their world was shaken.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>It was one-sided. The three men fell down before they could do anything, and Chris kicked them in the face as they tried to get up.</p>
<p>Blood splashed. As they lost their consciousness, they couldn’t move or rush at Chris anymore.</p>
<p>Valhalla—there was a way for them to live here. They would sort out a situation through a duel when deciding between right and wrong, but the way they decided victory and defeat was different from that of other nations.</p>
<p>There were three ways. It was either being dead or becoming incapable of fighting. And if that didn’t happen, then the last way would be for them to admit surrender and end the confrontation.</p>
<p>Just bleeding and falling didn’t decide things. The people of Valhalla hated to die shouting surrender, so the drunk could only end it by being unconscious.</p>
<p>It was a pitiful situation. The inn, which had a casual atmosphere until now, had turned into a mess, with people bleeding on the ground and tables broken. Yet the reaction of the owner was calm.</p>
<p>Seeing him accept it as if it were normal, Roman Dmitry got up and placed a gold coin on the table.</p>
<p>“I will pay for this mess in gold coins. And where is the busiest place in Paulo?”</p>
<p>The owner had a bright expression.</p>
<p>“Oh my, thank you. I will guide you to the busiest street in Paulo.”</p>
<p>Even the people of Valhalla were all just humans.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the owner, Roman Dmitry and his men arrived at the square full of people.</p>
<p>“This is Paulo Square. It is at the center of the city, and it is a place where many come and go since this is the center. Just in case something happens, I will warn you in advance that you shouldn’t make a mess here. I am a person who works for outsiders, so I can ignore most things, but there are always people who act extremely and don’t care about what the people here did to tackle them.”</p>
<p>It was a sincere warning. Covering his face with cloth, the owner hurried out of the square, fearing that others might see him.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry looked around. The people of Valhalla—they had a peaceful atmosphere.</p>
<p>Unlike other nations, they got along well with each other and solicited customers, while the merchants screamed to sell their products. The problem was that the people in other nations weren’t used to that. The merchants kept their mouths silent when people from other nations would get close, and some even covered their noses and frowned.</p>
<p>Honestly, Paulo wasn’t such a big city. Still, since it was a city close to the border, they came into contact with outsiders more than other cities in Valhalla, but during the festival time, the discrimination was known to be at its peak.</p>
<p>The festival honoring the souls of warriors was a privilege only for the people of Valhalla. However, there were cases where people who showed interest in the event would come to Valhalla to experience their festival, and their behavior didn’t seem so nice to the people of Valhalla.</p>
<p>They were not warriors. Only those who shed blood on the battlefield deserved to enjoy the festival, and outsiders do not get to enjoy it. It was unacceptable for the people of Valhalla. They didn’t want other nations to consume the culture of Valhalla, so it was dangerous to enter Valhalla during the festival time.</p>
<p>Roman walked among them. As people stepped away, each of them would whisper to the party and show how they disliked Roman Dmitry. It was only a matter of seconds before racism turned into violence. The moment even one of those with angry eyes stepped forward, they might resort to violence.</p>
<p>It was a fun nation. Despite being called an empire, it was a nation that hadn’t yet possessed the dignity of an empire. If Kronos couldn’t control their strong greed, then Valhalla didn’t abandon their savagery.</p>
<p>‘The chaos of the Salamander Continent is not a coincidence. Kronos and Valhalla. Since the two major mountain ranges that govern the continent are not fair in their growth, the continent is bound to suffer from violence from time to time. Even though people say Kronos is to blame, Valhalla’s actions are to blame too.’</p>
<p><em>Halt.</em></p>
<p>They stopped walking. This trip to Valhalla—it was the starting point of a new time. Before the war started in earnest, Roman Dmitry made his presence known here.</p>
<p><em>Whisper.</em></p>
<p>The people’s eyes were focused on the middle of the square. To the gazes of those who showed suspicion towards the people from other nations, Roman Dmitry spoke to them all.</p>
<p>“I am Roman Dmitry, the heir to the Dmitry Duchy! If there are people who want to confront me, come forward!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The atmosphere changed in an instant. At first, it was simply visible discrimination, yet now the people have shown their hostility towards him.</p>
<p>Opponent: Roman Dmitry. And the rumor was that he was an aura swordsman. Usually, people would get scared, but Valhalla was a different place.</p>
<p>“How dare you mess around in Valhalla? I will deal with you!”</p>
<p>It was a man with a strong physique. His huge body was very similar to that of a mountain, and his scarred face proved that he wasn’t an ordinary person.</p>
<p>Then the people surrounded the man and Roman. The stage for the confrontation had been set before anyone knew it, and even though there was no signal to start, the man rushed at him.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>Aura flared, and it looked like the man was an aura swordsman. His strength was not that comparable to Roman Dmitry, but it looked as if he would devour his opponent.</p>
<p><em>Woong.</em></p>
<p>He wielded a weapon that was like a huge axe, and as he moved, it looked like he could cut Roman down, but Roman just sidestepped. The sound of the wind being cut was scary to hear.</p>
<p>From the start, the man stepped forward as if to end the fight in an instant, and he pushed fiercely, ignoring his defense and only aiming for the vitals of his opponent. It definitely looked like he was looking down on his opponent.</p>
<p>Even though Roman Dmitry had the advantage, the man seemed to hold a strong power.</p>
<p>However, he picked the wrong opponent. Roman Dmitry simply walked to avoid the attack, and he hit his cheek, making him stagger.</p>
<p><em>Chak!</em></p>
<p>His head jerked back. Blood gushed from the man’s face, and drops of blood fell to the ground.</p>
<p>It was quite embarrassing. He was slapped on the cheek even though he swung his weapon, and this made the man grit his teeth in anger.</p>
<p>In Valhalla, disgrace was worse than death. The man’s muscles swelled up as if they were going to burst at any moment, but the weapon he wielded never hit the target. And as earlier…</p>
<p><em>Chak!</em></p>
<p>His cheek was slapped. At first, he thought it wasn’t an intentional attack, but this time, in a situation where his cheek was slapped again, he knew Roman Dmitry was looking down on him.</p>
<p>“You jerk!”</p>
<p>His anger exploded, but it was to be expected. It was an act of looking down. In Valhalla, it was the law to treat warriors equally, but this man was mocking him like a child.</p>
<p>His face was messed up. The man charged forward while wielding the axe without caring that he would be slapped again, but there was a limit to the movements that he could make.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>His head turned as he was still wielding the axe.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>Again. As he moved forward each time, he tried to attack Roman, but…</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>His legs staggered. The man was losing his mind. The shock blurred his vision, and his fiercely burning will as a warrior was being trampled on in front of everyone.</p>
<p>But strangely, the man wasn’t losing consciousness. Obviously, the shock of being slapped strongly was too much, but no matter how many times the man was hit, he didn’t lose consciousness.</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p><em>Slap! Slap!</em></p>
<p>In the end, the man was on his knees. He was also a human. Without being able to attack, he kept being hit in the face, and the man had to get out of the situation, so…</p>
<p>“…I surrender.”</p>
<p>Then Roman Dmitry lowered the hand he was about to use to slap him again.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>“Aghhhh.”</em></p>
<p>“I’d rather you die.”</p>
<p>“You bastard who lacks pride! Do not insult Valhalla!”</p>
<p>People booed the man. The three options. Among them, the fact that he chose to surrender made them change from cheering to shaming him. And as a man, it was embarrassing.</p>
<p>However, only the person who was hit knows. The mind-bending shock was so unfamiliar that he had never experienced it on the battlefield.</p>
<p>“Get lost. I will show the will of Valhalla.”</p>
<p>He was a different man. Unlike the previous man, he was a man with a lean body, but the scar on his face showed just how stubborn the guy was.</p>
<p>He knew he couldn’t win against Roman Dmitry. The aura swordsman who defeated Gustavo wasn’t someone a normal warrior could get close to.</p>
<p>However, surrendering was another matter. Even if he gets defeated, he intends to lose with honor. And such thoughts made him regain consciousness as he got slapped on the cheek.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>As his dagger attack was dodged, Roman slapped his cheek. As his head turned, the man briefly saw heaven.</p>
<p>‘… This is mad.’</p>
<p>It was a stinging pain that made him lose his vision. He staggered and tried to shout his surrender without realizing it, but he managed to stay silent, remembering how he had booed the guy before.</p>
<p>And he regretted it later. He seemed to understand why the man before him shouted surrender, but he didn’t want to show a humiliating side.</p>
<p>‘This is what I have decided.’</p>
<p>He gave up defending and rushed forward. Rather, he decided to get hit properly and faint. Then it would at least be an honorable defeat. However…</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p><em>Slap, slap.</em></p>
<p>No matter how much he got hit, he wasn’t fainting. Roman Dmitry slapped him again and let mana flow into the man’s cheek for him to realize how painful it was, but at the same time, he wouldn’t lose consciousness from the shock.</p>
<p>It was quite a flustering situation to be in. Thinking that the impact on his cheek would last until he shouted surrender, the man finally decided.</p>
<p>‘There is no other way.’</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>His head turned. With his legs staggering, the man collapsed, and then it looked like he fainted from the shock. He closed his eyes tightly. For the man who passed out after fighting to the end, even if he were defeated, people would applaud.</p>
<p>Above the darkness, he could hear Roman’s voice.</p>
<p>“Get up. You haven’t fainted yet.”</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>As his feet pressed against his vital points, the man got up, screaming. At the thought of his intentions being revealed, the guy’s face turned red in shame. He only knew it then.</p>
<p>‘This bastard, was he…’</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>From the start, he intended to trample on the pride of Valhalla.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 228 - Valhalla Kingdom (3)</p>
<p>At that time, Baron Paulo, who was handling business in his castle, got a sudden report from his subordinates.</p>
<p>“Lord! We have a problem at hand! Right now, in Paulo Square, Roman Dmitry is said to be fighting against the people of Valhalla! The problem is that no warrior can stand up to him, and they are all shouting surrender!”</p>
<p>“… What are you talking about?!”</p>
<p><em>Thud!</em></p>
<p>Baron Paulo jumped up from his seat at the sudden report. It was something that made no sense from start to finish.</p>
<p>It was absurd that Roman Dmitry, who was just an outsider, was fighting, and the Valhalla warriors were shouting defeat, unable to stand.</p>
<p>It was an act that Valhalla would never accept. Especially during the festival time, there were a lot of eyes from outsiders, and what would they think of Valhalla?</p>
<p>The subordinate explained the situation. As Roman Dmitry was said to have used violence to induce surrender, Baron Paulo couldn’t calm his anger.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. In the end, he is causing trouble.”</p>
<p>His trip to Valhalla—he had heard the information from his superior. Rumors had it that Roman Dmitry had unbelievable strength and that his presence couldn’t be rivaled.</p>
<p>While living in Dmitry, he raised his name’s value by intervening in the war with the Barco family and later turned the world upside down with unconventional moves such as the Southern Front and the Public Ranking battles.</p>
<p>In addition, rumors recently circulated that he got involved with the changes in the Redford Kingdom. It was said that the presence of an awl in a pocket could not be hidden, even if one wanted to hide it, but Roman Dmitry didn’t hide it at all.</p>
<p>Actually, Valhalla’s leaders had no confidence that Roman Dmitry would accept the invitation. Even though dealing with Barbossa meant risking his life, Roman Dmitry still came to Valhalla.</p>
<p>And then, the leaders conveyed these words,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry is a scapegoat that will increase the reputation of the Valhalla Empire. Until he gets on the stage that has been laid out, show him what Valhalla is like. That it is different from the inside, unlike a well like Dmitry. If he ends up going through all the hardships and reaches the capital, he’ll be down even before the fight.”</p>
<p>For that reason, he didn’t even send a guide. After suffering from the people of Valhalla’s discrimination, the plan was to send someone when Roman reached the capital and then make it look like Valhalla did its part.</p>
<p>But now things were a mess. If Roman made his presence known like this, then the situation wouldn’t be good for them.</p>
<p>Baron Paulo said,</p>
<p>“Call the others. I will show what Valhalla is to Roman Dmitry myself.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>Baron Paulo left his office with an angry face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p><em>“… Ugh.“</em></p>
<p>The people were groaning, and there were a dozen of them already. Those who courageously agreed to deal with Roman Dmitry were humiliated to the point that they were ashamed to laugh at the previous ones.</p>
<p>The violence continued without them losing consciousness. The spirit of Valhalla, which everyone thought was steel, began to melt away.</p>
<p>Even so, the challenges continued. When surrender flowed from the mouths of his opponents, Baron Paulo appeared with his troops.</p>
<p>“What is this?!”</p>
<p>As soon as he arrived, he shouted, and the place turned quiet. Baron Paulo’s attention was drawn more to the shocked expressions around him than to the disfigured faces. He felt that the pride of Valhalla he believed in had been crushed.</p>
<p>He believed that the people of Valhalla would never shout surrender, but the sight in front of him was too much. Baron Paulo pressed on and asked,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. You are an outsider and a guest in Valhalla. So why are you behaving like this? If you cannot provide me with a good reason, you will leave me with no choice but to punish you for this.”</p>
<p>“For a good reason. I thought Vahalla wanted this situation.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said as he looked at the Baron with a face that said he wasn’t bothered even after fighting a dozen warriors.</p>
<p>“I am an invited guest to fight against Barbossa. In the process of entering Paulo, we revealed this fact, and we even asked the guards to guide us to the capital, but they didn’t take any action and were acting too hostile toward us. And once we entered, the racism continued. No other nation treats its guests like this. But someone came up to me and said that Valhalla is a world ruled by power. So I taught those who looked at me in a hostile manner, who is above and who is below.”</p>
<p>“… What?!”</p>
<p>Baron Paulo was shocked. It was more than he expected. Roman Dmitry was more aggressive than the people of Valhalla. He didn’t think that if he didn’t treat Roman appropriately, he would make a show of force in Valhalla style.</p>
<p>Roman’s words—he partly understood them. Actually, no matter how foreign he was, the person they invited directly had to be treated right, but Roman Dmitry was a target for revenge, so he wasn’t cared for. And in the series of circumstances, there was nothing to hold Roman Dmitry accountable for.</p>
<p>Even though he defeated the people of Valhalla, confrontations were a very common occurrence in Valhalla in the first place. But the problem was that Roman Dmitry was leading this, and the people of Valhalla were defeated in a humiliating manner.</p>
<p>‘If the situation ends as it is, it is obvious that I will be reprimanded by the leaders. Even if I have to use force, it is necessary to restrict Roman Dmitry from going wild in Valhalla.’</p>
<p>“Even so, this cannot be overlooked. In Valhalla, there is no way a loser should be trampled like this. Fights should pursue the meaning behind them, and courtesy towards the other party should be present. We will conduct an investigation according to the process. If it turns out that you are innocent in the process, I will guide you to the capital.”</p>
<p>It was a debatable answer. In the situation where Baron Paulo was forced to act, Roman smiled.</p>
<p>“What if I refuse?”</p>
<p>“… You have no right to say no. This is the land of Valhalla.”</p>
<p>“The land of Valhalla. Then I will handle this matter according to the laws of Valhalla. In Valhalla, I heard that when the responsibilities that both sides should take are ambiguous, the situation is settled through a duel trial. If you wish to take me in for an investigation, tie my hands and lead me there. If Baron Paulo wishes, then you can bring in all your troops to take me.”</p>
<p>It was an obvious provocation, and this made the Baron’s expression turn cold. Roman Dmitry’s remarks crossed the line, but the situation was resolved by force, which was what he wanted.</p>
<p>He took a step back, and he shouted like thunder,</p>
<p>“Soldiers! Listen! Bind Roman Dmitry right now!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A duel trial had no rules. As the situation was different from what was expected, Baron Paulo ordered many soldiers to attack.</p>
<p>It was a one-on-one fight, and the soldiers rushed in. Despite their appearance of raising their weapons and revealing their killing intent, the soldiers who were lined up behind Roman Dmitry didn’t move.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p>The soldiers moved while stabbing their spears.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry took a step and evaded all of the attacks, and like in the previous fight, he didn’t use any weapons. His sword was hanging from his waist. Seeing that, the soldiers showed their anger and swung their weapons more fiercely, but every time their attack failed, a powerful shock hit them.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>His strength was able to push the body of the soldier. With one slap, the soldier’s eyes rolled, and he fell to his knees.</p>
<p>From the start, Roman Dmitry wasn’t using any weapons. He intended to prove how overwhelming the difference between himself and his opponents was with just his hands and legs. But….</p>
<p>“Mr. Roman Dmitry. You better not take this lightly.”</p>
<p>Baron Paulo smiled. In Roman Dmitry’s attacks, one of the soldiers who was slapped didn’t fall.</p>
<p>It had the force of hitting something like steel. The face of the soldier changed, and his face contorted.</p>
<p><em>“Uhhhhh.”</em></p>
<p>The body of the soldier—he was a savage. As the change spread through his body, all the hairs on the soldier’s body stood, and he looked somewhere between a beast and a human.</p>
<p><em>“Kuak!”</em></p>
<p>The savage ran. He scratched Roman Dmitry with his sharp nails, and the other soldiers also changed their attack methods. All of them were acting like wild men.</p>
<p>There were a lot of changes. Someone looked like a wolf, some like a bear, and another like a deer—all of them looked like beasts.</p>
<p>Beast Men—they were the ethnic minority found in the southern jungles. From the time they were born, they grew up drinking animal milk and were reborn as true savages through a ritual to accept the appearance of the most friendly beast.</p>
<p>Even in Valhalla, they were known to have the highest combat capabilities. They only took the form of normal soldiers, but the savage troops were the elite of Valhalla.</p>
<p>As they attacked, the people clenched their fists. If they were beasts, they thought that they could defeat Roman Dmitry, who didn’t care about using his weapons.</p>
<p>Right. It was an illusion. The moment when a savage in the shape of a bear disregarded his defense and attacked…</p>
<p><em>Crush.</em></p>
<p>A fierce fist hit his face, and the eyes of the Beast Man felt lost.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There were some things people misunderstood. The King of all animals. The way to represent Baek Joong-hyuk, the Heavenly Demon, could be described as such.</p>
<p>Baek Joong-hyuk conquered Murim with a single sword and was recognized as the best man in the world who could represent both Murim in name and reality.</p>
<p>But what was the next best weapon he could use after the sword? People mentioned that he could use various weapons with perfection, but in fact, except for the sword, every other weapon felt odd, and he was more familiar with his hands and feet.</p>
<p>At the bottom of his life, in order to survive the fight for survival, he had to use his hands and feet, as well as everything that he could use as a weapon around him.</p>
<p>And the process made Baek Joong-hyuk reach his peak. In the wilder environment, Baek Joong-hyuk destroyed the Beast Men with his hands and feet.</p>
<p>The existence of the savages—he knew about them. The aura of mana exploded inside them, but Roman Dmitry didn’t care.</p>
<p><em>Crush!</em></p>
<p><em>“… Kuak!“</em></p>
<p>The beast’s face was crushed. The beast’s hard skull cracked, and he stumbled back as he fell. It only took an instant for the shock to spread. The beast in the form of a bear was famous for being durable among all Beast Men, but collapsing with one punch wasn’t what everyone expected.</p>
<p><em>“Grrrrr.”</em></p>
<p>“<em>Kuak.</em> All at once. <em>Grrrr.</em> Attack!”</p>
<p>As he had expected, the beasts rushed at him. Seeing them attack from both sides, Roman Dmitry kicked and smashed their faces, and a bird-faced savage with wings was slammed to the ground.</p>
<p>This time, their solid durability was of no use. The beasts couldn’t hold back their screams at the pain that pierced them deep into their bones.</p>
<p>In the one-on-one fight, Roman Dmitry was supposed to be at a disadvantage. If he didn’t use weapons, it was right for him to lose against these beasts, whose entire bodies seemed like weapons.</p>
<p>But what was this situation? While Baron Paulo’s mouth was wide open, the situation was quickly sorted out.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p><em>“Kuak.”</em></p>
<p>His face jerked. Seeing the beast lowering his head, the last one in the form of a buffalo fell, and he was shocked.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry approached him.</p>
<p>“Say you surrender. Then this will end quickly.”</p>
<p><em>Slap!</em></p>
<p>His cheek moved. The beast didn’t even think about resisting. The beast, who was born with the nature of a beast, was overwhelmed at the sight of a predator in front of him.</p>
<p>As he trembled under the hand of Roman Dmitry, Roman continued to slap the Beast Man.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p><em>Slap. Slap.</em></p>
<p>In Murim, there was this martial art called the Golden Enhanced Palm. Even those with bodies like steel begged for their lives on their knees at the agony of the palm that pierced through their bodies.</p>
<p>It was violence that could distort even steel, and Roman Dmitry didn’t have to add further words. Without saying anything, he only focused on slapping the beast.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>Blood splashed.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>His teeth fell out.</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>His beastly look was now pitiful. It was totally overwhelming. The moment he accepted the fact that Roman was at the top of the predator list, the Beast Man opened his mouth and said,</p>
<p>“… P-Please spare me. I was wrong.”</p>
<p>That was all.</p>
<p><em>Tap.</em></p>
<p>He put down his hand that defeated the beast, and Roman Dmitry looked at Baron Paulo.</p>
<p>“What do you plan to do now?”</p>
<p>At those words, Baron Paulo unknowingly took a step back.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 229 - Valhalla Kingdom (4)</p>
<p>At that moment, Baron Paulo realized that he had stepped back, and his face turned red in shame. He was also a man who lived as a warrior until he took the position of Lord, so he couldn’t accept the fact that he was simply overwhelmed by force and resigned.</p>
<p>But even if Valhalla was a closed and racist nation, their attitude of accepting defeat in a battle wasn’t different.</p>
<p>“… I accept defeat. As promised, I will put other priorities aside and guide you directly to the capital.”</p>
<p>He had to hold back his anger. The order of his superior was out of the question. They had a duel with conditions, and if they lost, doing their part was the right outcome. Baron Paulo knew that.</p>
<p>Then the normal soldiers came forward to take away the Beast Men, who couldn’t come to their senses.</p>
<p>‘To defeat the Beast Men this mercilessly. Roman Dmitry, he might be more than what we know.’</p>
<p>In the upcoming fight, everyone was confident about Barbossa’s victory. No matter how famous Roman Dmitry had become recently, Barbossa had been on the lips of people on the continent for ten years. So they didn’t expect that Roman Dmitry would agree.</p>
<p>Valhalla revealed their intentions to get their revenge openly, yet Roman Dmitry didn’t back down.</p>
<p>A being with a tendency like Valhalla—it was odd. Being from a small nation, he was born with an odd disposition.</p>
<p>Baron Paulo said,</p>
<p>“First, we will guide all of you to a new accommodation. While you are comfortably resting there, we will figure out the schedule for the Warp Gate that connects directly to the capital and send you on your way as soon as possible. And I apologize for the mistake before. As Mr. Roman Dmitry said, Valhalla is a racist nation. However, if you knew about Valhalla’s past, I think you would understand us.”</p>
<p>A long time ago, during the days when Valhalla was called the ‘Savages of the South,’ there was a time when other people on the continent invaded Valhalla’s territories without rights and attacked them to get the resources of the southern jungle.</p>
<p>In reality, the fact that Valhalla was equipped with power was revealed, and the situation changed. Still, the memories of the pain accumulated in the memories of their ancestors left them with antipathy toward other nations.</p>
<p>As of now, even though the Valhalla imperial family is seeking drastic changes by accepting outsiders with talent, not everyone has agreed to it.</p>
<p>What did this national power mean?</p>
<p>Still, for Valhalla, the opinion of the common people who were ‘born in Valhalla’ was that they should be the ones to get nurtured into talented people rather than the ones outside.</p>
<p>Conservative forces that pursued their existence and progressive forces that wanted to change—that was the reality of Valhalla.</p>
<p>At the sight of Paulo walking forward with a changed attitude, Roman Dmitry didn’t say anything.</p>
<p>To end a grudge with victory and defeat—that was also the method of the Demonic Sect that Roman Dmitry was familiar with.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Baron Paulo was a man of many words and actions. He guided them to a lodging that was one hundred times better than the last one, where Roman ordered his men to rest.</p>
<p>In the large room, Roman Dmitry sat on the sofa and carefully organized his thoughts about the Valhalla Empire.</p>
<p>‘Valhalla, unlike Kronos, is a fairly fighting nation. While Kronos spoke of its ambition to conquer the nation, Valhalla seemed to be satisfied with the present state of the warriors forming its core. The problem is that the outside and the inside of the empire are different. Valhalla has similar ambitions to Kronos.’</p>
<p>In the past, Valhalla’s actions had made it clear. While they always seemed to be criticizing Kronos, they never once thought about stopping the wars that were happening all over the continent. They also hoped that other nations, except for Valhalla, would just crumble.</p>
<p>Actually, Valhalla’s ambition was obvious. Some people fantasized about the title of the nation’s warriors, but the so-called Savages of the South would need brains to defy the conspiracies before they could form an empire.</p>
<p>In fact, Valhalla seemed to be good at conspiracies. That was why they planted their own minion named Count Denver inside Cairo. Although they weren’t making any active moves toward conquering the continent, they were always looking for opportunities.</p>
<p>And with just one look, Roman could tell. To avenge Count Denver, they chose a very clever way to invite him to a fight instead of assassinating him.</p>
<p>‘Valhalla chose a way to rile me up before going onto the stage. If I defeat Barbossa, will the outcome be accepted? Maybe the conservative forces, but the progressive forces leading Valhalla might not. In the end, whatever the outcome, moving inside Valhalla is bound to be risky.’</p>
<p>The moment he set foot in Paulo, he was closer to danger. This was a place of death, and from now on, anything could happen.</p>
<p>For the empires, those with power didn’t need any excuses. Even if people criticized them for harming Roman Dmitry, it would fade over time.</p>
<p>‘Just like in my previous life.’</p>
<p>The life of the weak. He was used to it. The man named Baek Joong-hyuk took a risk in an environment worse than now to gain power.</p>
<p>So it didn’t matter what Valhalla meant.</p>
<p>The more they responded, the finale, which brought the end, would inevitably shine more brightly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>On the next day, Baron Paulo sent someone.</p>
<p>“I am Sanchez. I will guide you to the capital.”</p>
<p>It was a man in his mid-30s. With sun-tanned skin and his hair tied back, he told them that they had to move to a nearby city with a Warp Gate.</p>
<p>All the members of Roman’s party were prepared, and they followed Sanchez to Paulo. Soon, the atmosphere of a natural conversation began on the boring path.</p>
<p>“I have heard rumors about Mr. Roman Dmitry. It is said that when you defeated Butler, the Ranker, you were just in your mid-20s, and when you defeated Count Nicholas, the entirety of Cairo turned into a mess as you went up in order starting from the 100th rank. I felt so much admiration when such a story came up. Even though I was born in Valhalla, it feels like you are a warrior from Valhalla’s history.”</p>
<p>He was a talkative man. He showed respect at first, but as the travel time got longer, he began to touch on sensitive topics.</p>
<p>“… But is it true that you defeated Knight Gustavo alone? I am asking this since rumors are always exaggerated, so I don’t really believe what people say. And the man we are talking about is Knight Gustavo. In a situation where the soldiers of the Kronos Empire were swarming, would it make sense for you to be able to cut through the crowd and kill one knight? Well, in the absurd stories in history books, a single swordsman splits the ground and cuts down the sky, but isn’t Roman Dmitry human?”</p>
<p>He was speaking in an odd manner, as if in a roundabout way. At the remarks that continued to come, Chris’s expression began to change.</p>
<p>“Be careful with your words.”</p>
<p>“It is fine. Did you say it was Sanchez? It looks like you have something to say, so get straight to the point.”</p>
<p>At Roman’s words, Chris suppressed his anger. In the nation of Valhalla, from start to finish, no courtesy towards their guests could be found.</p>
<p>Sanchez grinned. In the first place, Roman Dmitry’s guide was brought by someone else, but he inevitably decided to act on his own.</p>
<p>“I will be honest with you while talking. Roman Dmitry. What qualifications do you have to be chosen as the opponent of Mr. Barbossa?”</p>
<p>From his words, the aggressive attitude of Valhalla, which was only heard in stories, was seen.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Sanchez—he was a disciple of Morales, the number 12 rank holder in Valhalla.</p>
<p>Morales and Barbossa—they were famous for their bad relationship.</p>
<p>Born in the same region, they had been competing since childhood, but Morales was always left behind by Barbossa’s talent.</p>
<p>Morales wasn’t lacking in skills. He was someone born with talent worthy of being called a genius in Valhalla, but Barbossa’s talent was unrivaled.</p>
<p>Half a year ago, Morales was singled out as a warrior for the festival. The festival honoring the souls of warriors—there was a saying that those who died there went to Valhalla regardless of victory or defeat, so Morales said that he would stand on the stage with joy.</p>
<p>Besides, when he heard that the opponent was Barbossa, he sincerely thought that the God of Warriors had created a perfect stage for him.</p>
<p>If Barbossa were defeated, it would be a chance to end their bad relationship. But even if he died, there was nothing bad about dying for Valhalla.</p>
<p>However, the arrival of Roman Dmitry upset everything. Morales strongly protested against Valhalla’s decision, but there was no way to reverse the decision already made.</p>
<p>Sanchez said,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, the chance you have stolen is the wish every warrior of Valhalla wants. So what qualifications do you have to go on stage? The leaders of Valhalla say that you are the right person because of your reputation on the continent, but I do not believe the rumors. Isn’t it too absurd? Even Morales, whom I serve, didn’t reach that level in his mid-20s. The continent’s first sword is the same. You were not validated and snatched the position we all hoped for.”</p>
<p>Since being disqualified, Morales lived in pain. Looking at that scene, Sanchez developed ill feelings toward Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“You don’t know the value of the position you have been given. There are many warriors in Valhalla who would give up their lives to stand on that stage. Please tell me. Do you think you are qualified to deal with Barbossa on behalf of Morales? If you die without being able to receive Barbossa’s sword, what will you do to the broken hearts of the Valhalla warriors who were waiting for such a day?”</p>
<p>His words. They were the same as the Valhalla Empire. He had a firm belief that Barbossa wouldn’t be defeated. Just as they spread rumors about Roman Dmitry, they devalued Roman Dmitry from beginning to end. At that moment….</p>
<p><em>Neigh.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry grabbed the horse’s reins and stopped.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>From start to end, he didn’t like the attitude of the people in Valhalla. People who didn’t talk about surrender and people who said that Valhalla was the best—such foolish things.</p>
<p>Was it even the right thing to do? In the world of the strong that eats the weak, it was natural to admit defeat and bow their heads. If a sheep exposes its teeth to the teeth of a beast, people won’t applaud it. However, the people of Valhalla took death so lightly to the point of stupidity.</p>
<p>Valhalla—Roman didn’t think such a place would exist, but out of their self-doubt, Roman asked.</p>
<p>“Sanchez. What is your basis for that judgment?”</p>
<p>In his past life, as he lived as the son of the Heavenly Demon, he didn’t tolerate being ignored by people. If he allowed people to look down on him, in a wild world, that would be the end.</p>
<p>Valhalla’s attitude, the words of Sanchez, and the reaction of the people being disappointed with Roman Dmitry being chosen—they touched a spot.</p>
<p>Sanchez said,</p>
<p>“… No evidence is needed. The reputation you have speaks for it.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>Then, in the situation that matched the picture he desired, Roman had the scariest smile.</p>
<p>“If you have doubts about me, let me show you that the results in Cairo and Valhalla aren’t so different. There are a few days left for the festival. Tell the warriors of Valhalla, including Morales. If there is a warrior who wants to visit me before the festival, I will gladly deal with them. It would be good to challenge me yourself too. If you draw your sword, I will deal with you right here.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words, Sanchez’s mind went blank.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 230 - Festival For Festival (1)</p>
<p>It was an obvious provocation. In a fit of rage, Sanchez put his hand on his sheath without a thought. But that was all. He didn’t pull out his sword. Roman Dmitry was so calm that he couldn’t feel anything, but beyond that, there was something that warned Sanchez’s nerves.</p>
<p>It was Chris. He also put his hand on his sheath, but he knew that Chris would be much faster at attacking.</p>
<p><em>Gulp.</em></p>
<p>He gulped. Sanchez was Morales’s disciple and had risen to the 3-star level, but this sense of threat was new to him.</p>
<p>‘… Was Dmitry’s Flash this good?’</p>
<p>He had heard about the rumors. The man who was called the Flash of Cairo. Among the people who followed Roman Dmitry, there was this handsome blonde man, and when he pulled out his sword, his opponent’s throat would be cut off without them seeing what hit them.</p>
<p>In the war against Kronos, Chris proved his worth. Chris was no longer an unknown figure, as he showed overwhelming power by cutting down his enemies in succession.</p>
<p>But the people of Valhalla didn’t listen to those rumors because achievements on the battlefield usually get exaggerated. Just like the rumor that Roman Dmitry cut through a crowd of knights with one hit, they also thought Chris was just a normal warrior.</p>
<p>It had to be that. Cairo was such a small world compared to Valhalla, and the history of the past said that an existence beyond common sense couldn’t be born in Cairo.</p>
<p>But he accepted the reality in front of him now. In a situation where his mouth went dry at Chris, Sanchez had no choice but to acknowledge the skills of his opponent.</p>
<p>‘The public rumors weren’t false. I’m not sure if Roman Dmitry is strong enough to overwhelm Knight Gustavo, but if his subordinates are of this level, I cannot deny those rumors any longer. Then he’s someone I cannot even comprehend. Will he be able to defeat Barbossa without using any tricks?’</p>
<p><em>Shhing.</em></p>
<p>He raised his hand, acknowledging the opponent. But even so, he didn’t think Roman Dmitry was a suitable opponent for Barbossa.</p>
<p>What kind of existence was suitable then? The festival of Valhalla was only for the warriors of Valhalla.</p>
<p>Sanchez said,</p>
<p>“Do not regret what you just said.”</p>
<p>He would find out the truth once he reached the capital and the consequences that awaited him for accepting the challenge.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Capital of Valhalla.</p>
<p>They arrived in Marin. If Paulo, which was located at the start of the border, was a bit underdeveloped, then Marin was this impressive city with huge walls and architecture unique to Valhalla, befitting the status of an empire.</p>
<p>Once they entered the capital, nothing like Paulo happened. There were people who met them in advance, and thanks to them, they were able to skip over the complicated process and go inside smoothly.</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you. I am Viscount Jonathan, who will serve as the guide for Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>“This is Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>Upon their arrival, they were guided to the reception room of a huge building that was presumed to be a place for guests to stay. So they settled in this place.</p>
<p>After taking a sip of the tea served by the servants, with a strange expression, Viscount Jonathan asked,</p>
<p>“I heard Mr. Roman Dmitry’s opinion through Sanchez. To prove that you are worthy of facing Barbossa, you will accept the challenge of the warriors of Valhalla. Will that be fine? I can keep silent for a day or so, but if I don’t speak now, it seems like you will be in trouble.”</p>
<p>“It is an issue that I should handle.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, if that is the case, it cannot be helped. Just keep in mind that the warriors of Valhalla want to step on the stage at the risk of their lives. To die with God’s blessing right in Valhalla—it is a lifelong wish of the warriors, and if the opponent is Barbossa, it is an unparalleled blessing.”</p>
<p>He also drank the tea.</p>
<p>Viscount Jonathan smiled, and the atmosphere changed with the stale smell of tea that people in Valhalla usually drank.</p>
<p>“Let me tell you. The festival will be held three days from now. As you know, at the end of the preparation for the festival, Valhalla has a tradition of making blood spill out. The method is quite simple. The families of the Valhalla Empire will select one swordsman representing their families and send them out to fight, and a total of thirty warriors will fight on the huge stage. There is no surrender there. Be the last one to stand or die. The warrior who remains as the final winner will receive the blessing of Valhalla directly from His Majesty, the Emperor.”</p>
<p>It was something he was familiar with. Thirty warriors. The last warrior would survive at the cost of the deaths of twenty-nine people, and the honor of Valhalla would be placed at stake.</p>
<p>“To brighten up the eve of the festival, how about having one of Roman Dmitry’s men participate? For reference, the swordsmen who participate in the fight of thirty people can be those who aren’t listed in the Continental Rankings too. Wouldn’t swordsmen of that level need a stage where they could focus on fighting each other in a group? From what I heard, there is one called Dmitry’s Flash and…”</p>
<p>His speech was blurred, yet his intention was clear. They wanted Chris on stage before the main event. Except for Roman Dmitry, it was clear that they intended to kill Chris, who was called Dmitry’s best swordsman under Roman, in front of everyone.</p>
<p>It was something he could just refuse. Now that they had risked stepping into Valhalla, there was no need to put Chris at further risk.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry smiled. He didn’t back down a single step from the intentions of the opponent, which he could thoroughly see.</p>
<p>“I shall do what you want.”</p>
<p>“As expected, so amazing. Then, do rest comfortably here until the eve… Ah!”</p>
<p>Viscount Jonathan grinned.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry. He was a warlike man. He liked Roman quite a bit, but the pride of Valhalla was a different thing.</p>
<p>“After what Sanchez said to you, it must be hard for you to rest in peace. Please, I hope it works out fine. Still, Valhalla’s imperial family has dignity, and it is difficult for Roman Dmitry to be Barbossa’s opponent, but there shouldn’t be any unfortunate changes on the stage, right? Two days later, on the eve of the festival, I hope to see you again with a smile.”</p>
<p>And that was the end. Viscount Jonathan stepped outside.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry remained at the reception. As if the warning that threatened him was nothing, he slowly savored the remaining tea with a relaxed face.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>It was early morning, and a group of people gathered in front of the lodging where Roman Dmitry was staying.</p>
<p>“Is Roman Dmitry here?”</p>
<p>“A bastard who doesn’t even know his place. Just because he made a little name on the continent, he became greedy to go on the stage of Valhalla. Roman Dmitry doesn’t have the right to go against Barbossa. If he collapses without even competing, the God of Valhalla will be angry.”</p>
<p>Last night, Sanchez told people what he had seen and heard, and the people were outraged. Other than their dissatisfaction about Roman going on stage, Roman Dmitry spat out remarks, provoking the warriors of Valhalla.</p>
<p>How flustering were those words? To think that a guy who was famous or gained fame for just two years was accepting challenges from the warriors. Honestly, there was a lot of talk in Valhalla about it. People raised their voices and asked the imperial family to reconsider their choice, but there was no way they could do anything.</p>
<p>Kronos and Valhalla—for both empires, the imperial family ruled with overwhelming power. Since the imperial family in Valhalla told them to see and judge for themselves, they had no choice but to believe and follow them.</p>
<p>The anger that he had barely suppressed, Roman Dmitry touched it again. From now on, even if the Valhalla imperial family tried to dissuade him, he intended to see the end.</p>
<p><em>Bang! Bang!</em></p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry, come out!”</p>
<p>“I came to challenge you as you asked. Come out right now and bring your sword!”</p>
<p>People raised their voices. There were hundreds of them, and it didn’t end there. Impatient people flocked when the lodging wasn’t open yet, but the number of people only increased as time went on.</p>
<p>Not all of them were strong enough to deal with Roman Dmitry. However, as warriors of Valhalla, they couldn’t just let Roman do what he wanted.</p>
<p><em>“Huk.”</em></p>
<p>“Bartolo!”</p>
<p>“Bartolo is here too!”</p>
<p>The people shouted. Breaking through the group, a man with a sturdy body named Bartolo stepped forward.</p>
<p>Ranked 89th in Valhalla, Bartolo was a person listed in the Valhalla rankings. If it was true that Roman Dmitry defeated Gustavo, then Bartolo, who was just a 4-star swordsman, could not compete with Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Even so, Bartolo showed no signs of doubting himself. Just like the other people in Valhalla, he didn’t believe the rumors about Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>During the war with Hector, Roman Dmitry fought with Butler. However, the rumor that he defeated Count Nicholas and Gustavo in one blow a year later didn’t make sense.</p>
<p>Bartolo raised his voice.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry! Bartolo will deal with you!”</p>
<p>At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Creak.</em></p>
<p>The door opened, and all eyes fell in that direction.</p>
<p>Finally, Roman Dmitry appeared.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s reaction was calm. Despite the crowd of people looking at him, he walked ahead as if nothing was wrong.</p>
<p><em>Clack!</em></p>
<p>He stopped walking, and then…</p>
<p>“There is only one day left until the eve of the festival. From now until the end of the day, I will accept all the challenges.”</p>
<p>He ruled out the possibility of being defeated, which made the people angry. They spat on the ground, cursed, and showed their animosity toward Roman Dmitry, who was holding his head high.</p>
<p>Why were they so bold? It was because they were looking at Bartolo, who would deal with Roman first. But…</p>
<p>‘… Roman Dmitry’s force is rather unusual.’</p>
<p>From the moment they met, Bartolo read the opponent’s force, and even though it wasn’t easy, Roman Dmitry had this intangible force around him. It was something normal people would never notice.</p>
<p>As there was a saying that you could only see as much as you knew, Bartolo, who entered the Valhalla rankings in his own right, knew that Roman Dmitry was stronger than he thought.</p>
<p>However, he couldn’t leave now. Bartolo stepped forward with a ferocious look.</p>
<p>“I will deal with you.”</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He held his weapon. Aiming his huge axe at the opponent, he slowly circled around Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>The confrontation started. Unlike his size, which overwhelmed the opponent, Bartolo carefully grasped the situation.</p>
<p>‘According to what Sanchez said, Roman Dmitry had already fought in Paulo before coming to Marin. It is said that he slapped people on the cheek until they gave up. Roman Dmitry. You cannot do that to us here. The results will not be the same. Even if I lose to you, in the face of violence, I will never surrender.’</p>
<p>His eyes shone. The people were watching. Just like those who were outraged by the news of Roman Dmitry, he had no intention of letting this matter go.</p>
<p>At that moment, he kicked the ground. Considering the calm reaction of his opponent, he decided to attack first.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>Aura exploded as Bartolo rushed forward. Unlike his huge size, he had sharp movements, and their distance was shortened at once.</p>
<p>A Ranker of Valhalla and a true warrior—that was how the warriors praised him.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p><em>Stumble.</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered in the air, and Bartolo looked at Roman Dmitry in disbelief. As he was losing consciousness….</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>Came Roman Dmitry’s cold voice.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 231 - Festival For Festival (2)</p>
<p>The faces of the people went stiff. Blood dripped on the ground, and they were shocked that someone had died. It was common for the Valhalla warriors to die in such fights, but the problem was how he died.</p>
<p>Bartolo was a Ranker in Valhalla. He was a skilled warrior who couldn’t be taken lightly, and he was wary of Roman Dmitry, so he observed the opponent’s movements until the end and made a surprise attack. So Bartolo should have had the upper hand.</p>
<p>People expected Roman Dmitry to be pushed back, but he was able to bring down his opponent with a single blow. Normal people couldn’t even properly observe how he attacked, and they only saw Bartolo stumble down.</p>
<p>It was a shocking sight. People couldn’t hide their shaking eyes at the thought that the rumor about Roman Dmitry defeating Gustavo in one hit might actually be true.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>Came Roman’s voice. He was so calm. As if it was not a big deal, Roman Dmitry took his eyes off Bartolo’s corpse.</p>
<p>His purpose for fighting in Paulo and Marin was different. In Paulo, if it was an armed demonstration announcing his arrival, it was a place to prove what kind of person Roman Dmitry was to stand up against Barbossa. It wasn’t necessary to obtain surrender with violence.</p>
<p>It was a clear example of how those who challenged him should prepare for their deaths. A single confrontation, rather than a hundred words, showed the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>If it were a different nation than Valhalla, people might just back off. However, those who truly followed the traditions of Valhalla were amused by Roman’s skills.</p>
<p>“Valhalla!”</p>
<p>A man stepped forward. He was an unknown person. Even though he knew he would die, he hoped that his existence would shine.</p>
<p>“I will challenge you this time.”</p>
<p>The place for verification—the stage to test Roman had begun.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>There wasn’t a referee, and there weren’t any rules. It was a simple fight between two people, and when a challenger stepped forward, people naturally created space. That was all. Even though no signal dropped, the challenger would rush forward.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>The current challenger used a dagger. The confrontation between Valhalla warriors didn’t cover any means or methods. The one-on-one fights didn’t have any prior signals, but it was common to use things such as daggers in the fights.</p>
<p>Even if they struck a vital spot, bit an ear, or stabbed the opponent’s eye, on a battlefield full of blood and death, surviving was their priority.</p>
<p><em>Swish.</em></p>
<p>The dagger flew. The challenger threw his dagger, thinking that the opponent would move, but Roman Dmitry didn’t move. The dagger just passed by Roman, and the challenger gritted his teeth. Raising his aura, he stabbed his sword towards the opponent’s chest.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p>His head flew off. Blood spurted out like a fountain, and the body ran past Roman before it fell forward.</p>
<p><em>Thud.</em></p>
<p>Blood dripped down, and Roman didn’t bother avoiding it. On the battlefield, accepting blood was the way of the Demonic Sect.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>“I am Gattu of Valhalla.”</p>
<p>It was a man called Gattu. This time, it was a Ranker from Valhalla. Even though the difference between him and Bartolo wasn’t that great, he looked at Roman with a red face.</p>
<p>That amazing force he could feel from Roman—dying from the strong was a blessing for Valhalla. Due to the previous results, Gattu thought that dying at the hands of Roman was also a blessing.</p>
<p><em>Woong.</em></p>
<p>He began to advance. Gattu, who used a mace that was suspended from a chain, wriggled his huge muscles to attack the opponent by swinging the mace.</p>
<p><em>Crush!</em></p>
<p>The ground smashed. It was a tremendous force. Aura rose, and it was freely being controlled around the chain. The mace came and blocked the direction of Roman Dmitry’s movement.</p>
<p>It was a unique attack method. Most aura swordsmen used a sword as a medium, but the warriors of Valhalla used other things.</p>
<p>Valhalla—that was why they were strong. The unusual attacks poked into the gaps, and the spirit of Valhalla burned in the presence of a strong opponent.</p>
<p>Those who spoke of surrender in Paulo. The fact that they were also born in Valhalla couldn’t be denied, but the people Roman was facing now were from the roots of Valhalla.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Gattu raised his aura. He changed the direction of the mace from a distance and gritted his teeth in an attempt to crush Roman Dmitry somehow. At that moment…</p>
<p><em>Papat.</em></p>
<p>The wind blew. The chain surrounded by aura was cut off at once, and the mace, which had lost its restraint, was falling to the ground. For Gattu, it was the moment he felt death arrive.</p>
<p>If he didn’t shout surrender, then the sword of Roman Dmitry would slit his throat, but Gattu grabbed the short chain attached to the mace with his bare hands and swung it at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“Di…<em>Kuak.</em>”</p>
<p><em>Slash.</em></p>
<p>The sword shone. Gattu’s head was blown off with a face of shock. The fact that the opponent held so much power excited him.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p><em>Roll.</em></p>
<p>His head rolled on the ground.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>The fight continued. The warriors, who weren’t afraid of death, continued to challenge Roman Dmitry, but none of them showed a meaningful fight.</p>
<p>The bodies piled up. At first, when one or two people died, they still had hope of defeating Roman, but when dozens of corpses piled up, their faces turned pale.</p>
<p>It was the same now, too. This time, the 57th Ranker of Valhalla stepped forward, and after a couple of attacks, a long cut went across his chest.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>His body trembled, and the Ranker knelt down. As for the people, they took a step back without realizing it.</p>
<p>“Next.”</p>
<p>At those repeated words, people looked into each other’s eyes. Those who truly believed in and followed Valhalla were willing to die, but not everyone in Valhalla had to do it. The world they lived in was the same, but only a few upheld the reputation of the warriors of Valhalla. For the most part, they were terrified of overpowering violence, just like those in Paulo.</p>
<p>They averted their gaze. Fearing that Roman Dmitry might look at them, no one looked him in the eye.</p>
<p>“The sun is still up. Is there anyone else who wants to challenge me?”</p>
<p>Early in the morning, people rushed here to fight. But as the sun began to rise in the middle of the sky, their ferocious nature didn’t work.</p>
<p>Corpses were scattered on the ground. And the skills that the warriors showed were nothing. They knew that unless they had a death wish, they couldn’t deal with Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>Roman said,</p>
<p>“There is one day left until the eve of the festival. If there is someone who wants to challenge me, knock on the door anytime.”</p>
<p>He stepped back, and people only looked at Roamn Dmitry until he left.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Marin City was shocked. Rumors about Roman Dmitry circulated. They heard that he accepted the challenge from Sanchez, but as the sun rose in the middle of the sky, they heard the shocking news.</p>
<p>“… It’s already over?”</p>
<p>“Right. People flocked early in the morning, but no one could counterattack him even once since the heads of the challengers would fly, and no one could challenge him without dying. So for now, I came back thinking it was a waste of time.”</p>
<p>“To think Roman Dmitry is that strong. What did the Rankers in Valhalla even do?”</p>
<p>“This man. Do you think Rankers didn’t go? The person whose head was blown off with one hit at the start was Bartolo, one of the Rankers, and even Gattu stepped forward, but he lost without being able to do anything against Roman Dmitry. I witnessed it all.”</p>
<p>“That is insane.”</p>
<p>The people were shocked. The value of the names of those who lost against Roman Dmitry—they have never, ever been careless. If he said that Bartolo died at the end of the battle, then people would accept it, but to die from one blow was unacceptable.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on distant battlefields, they were all denying the rumors about Roman. When they were told of the existence of Roman Dmitry, who had taken down Butler, Count Nicholas, and Count Gustavo with overwhelming power, they had already looked down on him, saying that it was a rumor unique to the battlefield for the sake of creating heroes.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t say that anymore. The value of the names of Rankers like Bartolo proved that the rumors about Roman Dmitry were true.</p>
<p>“… His ability overwhelmed Valhalla’s Rankers even though he’s in his 20s? I was wondering how the Cairo Kingdom defeated the Kronos Empire, and an unparalleled hero was born.”</p>
<p>They acknowledged Roman Dmitry. But apart from that, it was unacceptable for Roman Dmitry to stand on the festival stage. He was still lacking compared to Barbossa, the top Ranker in Valhalla.</p>
<p>Even if they acknowledged the rumors, they still didn’t consider him to be a suitable opponent for Barbossa.</p>
<p>“I want the top Rankers to be summoned. We cannot put Roman Dmitry on the stage like this.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it possible for Morales to step up now? Sanchez, his disciple, is the one who has spread the rumors about Roman, and in fact, Barbossa’s rival is Morales. He should be able to defeat Roman. Also, he is a suitable warrior to represent Valhalla.”</p>
<p>“Right. No matter how high Roman Dmitry’s achievements are, the odds of him defeating Morales are slim.”</p>
<p>Everyone agreed. Morales—they hoped that he would step forward. Even though he wasn’t in the Twelve Swords of the Continent, he was still a monster recognized by Valhalla.</p>
<p>It was a sure win. They never doubted the warriors representing their nation.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Wheeik.</em></p>
<p>The light flickered, and through the red light shining in the dark place, a tall man was wiping the blade of a sword with a dry cloth.</p>
<p>“Sanchez. Do you know why I am trying to fight with Barbossa?”</p>
<p>The man was Morales.</p>
<p>At Morales’s question, Sanchez said,</p>
<p>“Because of your bad past.”</p>
<p>“Right. At the start, my relationship with him stemmed from a bad tie-up. However, contrary to what people say, the main reason for our bad past isn’t because I developed some sort of inferiority complex towards him. He, who is of the Twelve Swords of the Continent, which Valhalla is proud of, wasn’t born with the warrior’s pride.”</p>
<p>Beyond his memories, he recalled his memories with Barbossa. When they first fought, Barbossa brought Morales down in an unfair way. From then on, Morales would gnash his teeth at Barbossa’s name.</p>
<p>“I hate Barbossa. I do not like the way he is considered a blessing to Valhalla and is cheered by people. I was hoping to fight him because I did not want to exist under the same sky as him. With just one thought of defeating him, the kind of person who uses disgusting means to win and tramples on the traditions of Valhalla, I honed my swordsmanship. But Roman Dmitry took my place. It could have been a choice to look down on me or maybe a dirty plan to protect Barbossa from the higher-ups. But I am sure that the stage of the festival is for me.”</p>
<p>“You are right.”</p>
<p>It was a bit surprising for Sanchez. Barbossa and Morales—he never thought there was such a special reason for the bad ties between them other than a rivalry to rise higher.</p>
<p>Morales raised his sword. The great sword suited his huge body.</p>
<p>“Sanchez. Call the people of Valhalla now so that everyone will watch the fight between me and Roman. I will prove to the leaders of Valhalla that I am a suitable opponent for Barbossa. If I can defeat Roman, then Barbossa will not be able to escape his fate.”</p>
<p>If he loses, he just loses. Morales’s tattooed arms twitched as he stepped into the sun.</p>
<p>The Monster of Valhalla—a monster of a different rank from the beings he had dealt with until now—finally raised his huge body.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 232 - Festival For Festival (3)</p>
<p><em>Whisper!</em></p>
<p>The people formed a long procession. At the front was a man with a large body moving ahead, receiving the gazes of everyone.</p>
<p>“Morales! Raise the honor of Valhalla!”</p>
<p>“We believe in you!”</p>
<p>“Nothing like Roman Dmitry can take Morales’s place!”</p>
<p>People were screaming from all sides. It was a familiar sight.</p>
<p>The monster of Valhalla or the man who was called the Fierce Warrior—Morales was the representative of Valhalla.</p>
<p>Having perfectly inherited the lineage of Valhalla, which people commonly thought about, he had proven his qualities as a warrior by wandering around the battlefield since he was a child.</p>
<p>He didn’t know what cowardice was. Even if his throat would be cut off, he genuinely enjoyed the confrontation with the strong, and when he first entered the rankings of Valhalla, he blew off the head of his opponent.</p>
<p>Ranked 12th—even though he wasn’t one of the strongest in the top 10, he was loved by the people of Valhalla regardless of his rank. It was like that.</p>
<p>He set out to deal with Roman Dmitry. People followed Morales and were confident of his victory.</p>
<p>‘Barbossa, I will break the cycle of evil by confronting you.’</p>
<p>Beyond his memories, he remembered his past encounter with Barbossa. Even at first, Morales wasn’t less talented than Barbossa, but he fell bleeding against Barbossa in a battle of the town’s best warriors.</p>
<p>It wasn’t because of his lack of skills. There was a force that hindered Morales before he went on stage, and he went on stage in the worst possible condition. He didn’t make any excuses.</p>
<p>In order to preserve his body, Morales knelt down. Even though he coughed up blood and had his skin ripped out, Morales looked up at his opponent. From that point on, the bad blood between them began.</p>
<p>His wounds from that day were covered with tattoos, and he devoted himself to training for the day he would meet Barbossa again.</p>
<p>However, reality didn’t change much. Barbossa was a descendant of a high noble family. With the power behind him, he grew up with full support, and unlike Morales, who grew rough in the wild, he developed by leaps and bounds.</p>
<p>6th and 12th. The future had been decided that way. The fine gap had now widened so much that he could catch up, but Morales still didn’t let go of his string of bad luck.</p>
<p>‘If I compromise with reality, I can live a comfortable life like you, but I am a warrior of Valhalla. In order not to be ashamed under the sky, I will try to become stronger with my own strength. Barbossa. I cannot tolerate a disgusting human like you wearing the mask of a warrior and being cheered on by people.’</p>
<p>This confrontation will take his life. Barbossa would try to kill him, but the memory of the day he clenched his teeth led him to the present.</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>He arrived at his destination. He saw the place where Roman Dmitry was staying. Morales took a deep breath, and with a loud voice as huge as his body, he called the name of the man who would fall as his sacrifice.</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry! I, Morales, will deal with you!”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>From the door, Roman Dmitry appeared. Upon hearing the name Morales, Roman didn’t react in particular. His face was devoid of fear, and Morales, who was interested in that, asked him,</p>
<p>“Roman Dmitry. I will ask you one thing. The Valhalla Empire invited you to fight against Barbossa to avenge the death of Count Denver. The pride of a warrior is nowhere to be found. It is obviously a position that puts your life at risk. So why the hell did you have to accept the invitation of the empire, knowing their intention?”</p>
<p>“Invitation for revenge?”</p>
<p>“What are they talking about?”</p>
<p>At Morales’s words, the people whispered. It was their first time hearing about it. Normal people thought that Roman Dmitry was just invited, but was there a dirty truth behind it?</p>
<p>The festival in Valhalla was a place to honor the souls of warriors. It needed people who would shine on the spot, but the leaders mixed in their greediness, which went against its true purpose.</p>
<p>Some of the people were angry. If Morales’s words were true, the Valhalla royal family plotted to defile Valhalla.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Why should I avoid it? If the place where my life is threatened is on a stage where we prove each other’s strength, then the Valhalla Empire cannot kill me.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean to say you will defeat Barbossa?”</p>
<p>“Otherwise, there is no reason to accept this invitation.”</p>
<p>“Hahahaha.”</p>
<p>Morales laughed loudly. Roman Dmitry—he liked him. Even knowing Valhalla’s cowardly plan, he trusted his own skills and stepped into the trap.</p>
<p>Reckless and bold—he was a man worthy of being called into Valhalla, which was known for its spirit.</p>
<p>“You are arrogant. Therefore, you deserve some respect. I love people like you who are mad. Warriors who fight with their strength until the end, knowing that they are here now, receive the blessing of Valhalla even after death. But it’s still too early. At the age of just 20, you didn’t even experience the real world. Dealing with Barbossa is too much. So, let me take your place.”</p>
<p>“You sound funny.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry chuckled.</p>
<p>“Until I reached the place that I am in now, dealing with swordsmen commonly referred to as Rankers, no one was certain of my victory. They always said the same thing as you. Still at the age of 20. Just like you said, I wouldn’t be able to win against the other Rankers who proved their skills. Yet, I am in front of you right now.”</p>
<p><em>Shhhing.</em></p>
<p>He drew his sword.</p>
<p>“Do you think you will be any different?”</p>
<p>The words he said made a crack appear in Morales’s expression. It was not of anger but of joy. It was unexpected. Roman Dmitry, who was thought to be arrogant, was a proper madman who had the spirit of Valhalla.</p>
<p>The confrontation with the strong was always bloody. There were no questions or answers, and no words were needed.</p>
<p>“Fine. From now on, let us check who is the right warrior for the festival.”</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>His mana exploded, and Morales lunged at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>People didn’t see it. The moment they blinked their eyes, a man with a huge body that filled in their visions suddenly appeared in front of Roman Dmitry and brandished his great sword.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>A powerful explosion occurred. Morales’s great sword generated an aura that was on a different level from those he had dealt with before, and this huge aura was one that wanted to devour Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>The ground trembled. A shock would spread each time their weapons collided, and those who watched the scene fell to the ground or stepped back.</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p>He tried to knock his head down, and Roman Dmitry raised his sword to block it, but Morales slashed it down like it didn’t matter.</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>It was a violent attack. With his chest wide open, he pushed forward with an attack without thinking about defense.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>His sword cut through the wind, and Roman tried to strike it back. However, Morales sensed the movement of the sword right in front of him, and he exploded aura on a part of his body to change direction.</p>
<p>It was a really small difference. If there had been a margin of error, his skin would have been split open with his intestines gushing out, but Morales rushed at him as if nothing had happened.</p>
<p>“Where?!”</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p>A broad-minded warrior—that was what he was called. He was an existence that didn’t care about the general match’s rules. Morales stood on the blade. On his skin, which was covered in tattoos, were the wounds that were barely visible and showed how beastly he was.</p>
<p>A messy group of cuts, rips, and open wounds covered his body, but Morales was a clenched-fist kind of man who believed that a fight without a scar was not a real fight.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>Cornering his opponent, he raised his aura. His aura, which exploded as if it would pierce the sky, pressed down on Roman Dmitry once more.</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwaaaang!</em></p>
<p>‘He stopped this?’</p>
<p>Morales’s eyes lit up. The slash he just made was a 5-star sword attack that shouldn’t have been blocked. However, Roman Dmitry didn’t just block it. He immediately followed up and used the loophole it had. It was all too fast.</p>
<p>He reacted in an instant by exploding his aura, but Morales’s cheek had a line of red blood flowing down.</p>
<p><em>Grin.</em></p>
<p><em>Laugh.</em></p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was real. He didn’t just have some foolish confidence. He was someone who really had the skills to deal with Barbossa.</p>
<p>‘The world is wide. To reach this level at the age of 20.’</p>
<p>Beyond his memories, he remembered the existence of the Best Sword. Even the monstrous creatures that Morales had to truly and fully admit defeat for the first time weren’t as strong as Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>But Roman Dmitry was young. It was a harsh fate for them to meet when he was still young.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>He stepped onto the ground. A wave of aura moved, and cracks appeared on the ground as if there had been an earthquake.</p>
<p>It was an unusual way to use aura. The ground collapsed, limiting the space that they could step on, and stones rose up, preventing Roman Dmitry from moving. He had driven his opponent into a corner.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>Morales’s sword fell on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a fleeting moment. The opponent’s intentions were clear. Morales collapsed the surrounding terrain for a pure power confrontation.</p>
<p>‘Is he different from the other Rankers?’</p>
<p>His opponents in the past—the use of their aura was limited. The aura that exploded from their bodies was expressed through a medium, or they just used it to amplify the skills of their bodies.</p>
<p>However, Morales was different. By spreading his aura onto the ground, it caused cracks like an earthquake, and he adjusted the stones in the air where he had gaps in his movement.</p>
<p>It was a moment’s thought, and he was cornered. Roman Dmitry could face him head-on, but he was actively responding to the intentions of his opponent.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>He moved back, and as soon as he stepped on the ground, he staggered, and Morales rushed at him.</p>
<p>“No more running away!”</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>His great sword blew up in size. The sharpness of his aura was so great, and it looked as if the size of his great sword had doubled.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>The attack exploded. Restricting the space by collapsing the ground and using stones, Roman Dmitry moved insanely out of the unavoidable situation.</p>
<p>Sparks exploded everywhere. Ordinary people couldn’t even open their eyes at the storm of auras, and the only thing they could see was a scene in which the lights of the auras intertwined and collided with each other.</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p>The wind was being cut down. The air parted, and Morales turned to Roman.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>He put his feet on the ground, and the ground collapsed. At the same time, a bouncing rock blocked Roman Dmitry’s movements.</p>
<p>That was the end. The moment Morales’s sword fell toward Roman, Roman’s form vanished.</p>
<p>Morales fell into a delusion. In the first place, it would be hasty to think he had the upper hand in the battle of strength and power, but there had been no effect on Roman.</p>
<p>In his previous life, he fought battles in various conditions—wide lands, shaky ships, and even the edge of a cliff where he couldn’t back down.</p>
<p>Space. It was just space. How to use it was up to the people.</p>
<p><em>Tuk.</em></p>
<p>As he gazed above, Roman Dmitry was there. He stepped onto the stone in the air, but the stone wasn’t falling down. Rather, it added solid footing for Roman.</p>
<p>Void Movement—it was a feat showing how great he was. Roman Dmitry used the stones floating in the air as steps and disappeared in an instant to where Morales couldn’t attack.</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Morales’s plan became useless. The way he had defeated countless enemies in the past, Roman Dmitry covered it up. It was incredible to watch.</p>
<p>As Morales was still shocked, a flame-like aura fell from above his head at the speed of lightning.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 233 - Festival For Festival (4)</p>
<p>The situation was visually hard to accept. Nowhere else in the world was there any skill where one could gain momentum by stepping on a flying stone.</p>
<p><em>Rumble.</em></p>
<p>The world was bright. As the lightning fell from the sky, Morales raised his head and swung his sword upwards.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p>It was a huge shock. His muscles were being pushed to an extent, and the hair on his body was standing up. Morales was pushed all the way, with his form collapsing.</p>
<p>The people were shocked. Since Morales was a monster in Valhalla, he was the symbol of strength, but the scene before them showed Morales getting pushed back.</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p>The ground collapsed. The land that was softened by the impact collapsed, but Roman Dmitry wasn’t constrained by the terrain.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p>It was a strange move. He was like a person who had no weight, and even when he was stepping on the ground or running, nothing felt odd. The people in this world only knew how to use aura to explode and kill.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry’s strength was a martial art that pursued ‘Lightness,’ and his appearance of gaining force even with the falling stones added more shock.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>He moved to the side. It was a place where there was nothing to step on, but Roman Dmitry swung his sword while stepping on a stone the size of a fist.</p>
<p>Morales had a quick reaction. He boldly tilted his head and let go of the opponent’s attack, but Roman Dmitry once again gained force, jumped, and slashed him down with his sword.</p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Morales’s expression went stiff. Just looking at how the attack flowed from Roman, his face was red, and the others were the same.</p>
<p>Even though he considered Roman Dmitry to be of the same kind as himself, he didn’t think a swordsman in his 20s would be stronger than himself.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a decision based on common sense. The memories he had experienced while wandering numerous battlefields made him unable to accept that Roman was stronger than himself.</p>
<p>However, not anymore. It was a fierce fight, and Roman had the advantage. It wasn’t just the land around them, but he was also pressing down on Morales.</p>
<p>After all, the world was wide, and Roman Dmitry’s movements were too bizarre for Morales to understand, even considering that a being with all these skills was still in his 20s. In a normal sense, it made no sense, so Morales accepted the reality that he might be defeated in this confrontation.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>They rushed at each other. Morales, who pushed Roman Dmitry back with his aura, smiled.</p>
<p>“This is so fun!”</p>
<p>He always wanted to have fun fighting someone like Roman Dmitry and exist as a warrior under the blessing of Valhalla. His open chest showed his scars and proved he was truly happy.</p>
<p>“From now on, I won’t think about the future. This Morales will do everything in his power to defeat Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>Mana raged, and a change began to spread all throughout his body. His bones twisted. His huge body swelled to a larger size than before, and his hair grew out of his pores and began to move wildly, covering his entire body to the extent that no tattoos could be found.</p>
<p>Morales’s face contorted. As he looked ahead, he groaned while looking at his opponent. A being in the shape of a bear—he was a descendant of a Beast Man.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The empire’s top Rankers—before reaching that spot, they would have to fight constantly, and having a strong aura wasn’t all that they needed.</p>
<p>The criterion for determining one’s strength was how one could handle power, and Morales was not able to occupy the 12th place with only bold attacks. He had the ability to change that was only allowed for the Beast Men, and as he developed it, Morales reached the stage of assimilation.</p>
<p><em>“Grrr.”</em></p>
<p>The blood of a beast circulated in his head. His senses expanded, and he accepted the odd sensations that were transmitted through his surroundings. Then he threw away his great sword. His nails grew from both hands, and they were enveloped in aura, which made it look like he was holding ten swords in each hand.</p>
<p><em>Tak.</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>The moment he hit the ground, there was a shock, as if the ground would collapse. Morales and his huge body, which was over 3 meters tall, rushed to Roman Dmitry and swung both hands straight with aura.</p>
<p>It was an attack that made one shudder at the sight of it. Roman Dmitry’s existence seemed to be reduced to that of the beast’s prey. However, Roman faced his opponent. He didn’t back down, and he confronted him head-on.</p>
<p><em>Kwakwakwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Rumble!</em></p>
<p>From then on, it was a realm of transcendence. As if expecting Roman Dmitry to block the attack, Morales pushed ahead, not even caring about defense. Roman Dmitry’s counterattack didn’t appear to be easy to stop.</p>
<p>The senses of the beast, which were now ten or twenty times greater, rapidly heated up and recognized the intention of the opponent from the start.</p>
<p>The moment he moved his right finger, Roman had already moved to avoid his attack. Then, when he twisted his body and lowered his sword, Morales reacted quickly and slashed the opponent’s attack.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p>The shock was strong. Morales began to bleed from the corner of his mouth, and his expression had contorted into a happy one as he accepted it.</p>
<p>“Let’s see this until the end!”</p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p><em>Ba-Bang!</em></p>
<p>Whether he died here or whether it was Roman Dmitry who would die, there was only going to be one winner. Even though they had never come across each other before, beings born as warriors of Valhalla meant that they were destined to accept death at any time.</p>
<p>At least Roman Dmitry was nice, and he was better suited to fight Barbossa in Valhalla’s festival. Facing his own attacks head-on, it was the battle of warriors that Morales had hoped to see.</p>
<p>His life was burning. Each time his aura rose, and each time Roman Dmitry ran, his body was screaming. It was warning him that he was using excessive power beyond his human limits, and he would have to pay the price for it. However…</p>
<p>‘I will win.’</p>
<p>Even if he accepted defeat, he wasn’t going to give up easily. Morales frantically raised his aura. As if he had lost control of his body, Morales began to spread all the aura in his body to the ground and pushed himself at Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>The aura was intensely burning. The 10-level Aura that was expressed through his nails proved to the observers how Morales had risen to 12th place.</p>
<p>He was a broad-minded warrior. Even Rankers in the top ten would avoid him. Everyone hated dealing with him because of his difficult nature, as he was a descendant of the Beast Men, and his attacks neglected defense. So, it was said that Barbossa was reluctant to confront him.</p>
<p>Barbossa was a 6-star swordsman and had the Twelve Swords title on the continent, but that didn’t mean he could defeat Morales without getting wounded.</p>
<p>An opponent who left the realm of aura and took damage—that was what Morales was known for, and he was a true warrior of Valhalla.</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p>He made the ground collapse once again. He knew his opponent wouldn’t back off. His bizarre movement wouldn’t be halted by the terrain, but he tried to explode his aura by predicting his opponent’s direction.</p>
<p>At that moment, Morales’s eyes twitched. Before even exploding his aura, a flashing sword cut through his chest.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Morales was strong. The beings that he had fought with in the past. Even though they were on a different level, there was something that the people of Valhalla overlooked.</p>
<p>The public rumors. The achievement that shocked people wasn’t the result of Roman Dmitry’s efforts.</p>
<p>‘Morales. You are a true warrior.’</p>
<p>Valhalla was said to be a nation of warriors. However, Roman Dmitry’s experience in Vahalla was different from the rumors, as he faced extreme racial discrimination and surrendered to overwhelming violence.</p>
<p>It was a series of disappointments. The only opponent of the Kronos Empire wasn’t a nation that had enough dignity to rule the continent.</p>
<p>And in the meantime, Morales proved Valhalla’s roots. How Valhalla was born, how the empire formed, and his existence said everything.</p>
<p>The struggle that Valhalla spoke about was similar to the methods of the Demonic Sect. Even though the law of the wild was desperate, with life as collateral, throughout the continent, Valhalla was a nation that pursued a method similar to what Roman Dmitry was accustomed to.</p>
<p>His confrontation with Morales wasn’t about mercy. If Valhalla was similar to the Demonic Sect, it was time for him to prove what was right through force.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry—the swordsman of a weak nation whom people criticized. Against Barbossa, they thought he was someone who was lacking a lot and was worried about.</p>
<p>The battle of strength and power—he enjoyed the fight. He wanted to witness his presence with his own eyes, and the public wanted to see their victory.</p>
<p>In that sense, Morales was someone who genuinely made Roman happy. His attack by turning into a beast showed that the Salamander Continent had places built on effort.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>The sword cut through his chest. His skin was rough, and even though it was as hard as steel, it cracked. However, Morales pressed on without a groan.</p>
<p><em>“Ack!”</em></p>
<p><em>Bang!</em></p>
<p><em>Babang!</em></p>
<p>Despite knowing that his defeat was coming, no fear of death could be seen in him. And going against Morales, whose presence was burning, Roman Dmitry was willing to fight him.</p>
<p>He cut his arm, blocked his attack, and cut his leg. Then he threw him to the ground as he was rushing to tackle him.</p>
<p><em>Kwak!</em></p>
<p>Blood splattered. His face was crushed to the ground, making it shatter. The blood that flowed from Morales was too much, but he raised his head and showed the people his bloody face.</p>
<p>Screams were heard everywhere. Even though people couldn’t accept the truth about Morales, whom they trusted and followed, being crushed one-sidedly like this, the scene in front of them was forcing them to face reality.</p>
<p><em>Drop.</em></p>
<p>The ground was stained with blood. Morales smiled and chuckled.</p>
<p>The pain was familiar. He knew he was on the verge of death.</p>
<p>It was clear. He was going to die here today.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The transformation ended. Returning to his human form, Morales screamed with a face filled with madness.</p>
<p>“People of Valhalla! Remember today. Dmitry’s successor, Roman Dmitry, accepted the invitation even after knowing the cowardly plot of Valhalla. He is someone who is born with the pride of a warrior. When all of us doubted his existence, even before the fight against Barbossa, he accepted our challenge without any shame!”</p>
<p>It was a desperate shout. His desperate voice proved that Morales wouldn’t stay alive for long.</p>
<p>“This was such a joy. Valhalla lost its roots as it leaped into an empire, and the nation became large, but we have a narrower mind than a small nation. There are no longer any warriors who want strength. It has become an era in which those who respond to political interests gain power. So, welcome Roman Dmitry’s presence. Enjoy his fight. Keep your eyes open so no one can interfere in the battle between Barbossa and Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>The imperial family of Valhalla—Barbossa was their dog. The imperial family would surely be planning for a perfect victory and would try to do anything to make Barbossa win.</p>
<p>Upon Roman Dmitry’s arrival in Paulo, seeing how he wasn’t guided by the officials and suffered racial discrimination proved how narrow-minded these people were.</p>
<p><em>“Cough.”</em></p>
<p>He coughed up blood and gripped his sword. As he raised his aura with his sharpened sword, he rushed towards Roman. He was already dead inside.</p>
<p>From the intense clash, his life appeared as precarious as a candle that had all melted away. In that situation, Roman Dmitry showed a ‘part’ of his power in the appearance of a life force and rushed forward.</p>
<p><em>Step.</em></p>
<p>There was an intense light, and no one could see the truth. Before they could even recognize that something had happened, Roman Dmitry’s sword cut through Morales’s broad chest once again.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p>Pain rose. Feeling the burning pain spread throughout his entire body, Morales smiled brightly at Roman. He was convinced that, with the attack he just made, he strongly believed that Roman could surely defeat Barbossa.</p>
<p>‘Barbossa. The messenger of death, who will release me, will visit you soon.’</p>
<p>Morales collapsed. After that, everyone, including Sanchez, had their eyes wide open in shock at the sight.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 234 - Festival For Festival (5)</p>
<p>Sanchez’s eyes trembled. Morales’s defeat was unexpected. He couldn’t accept the reality that his master, who was like heaven, had been defeated by Roman Dmitry, who was younger than his master.</p>
<p>But he saw it with his own eyes. Roman Dmitry consistently had the upper hand, and Morales struggled until the end and accepted the price of defeat as a warrior.</p>
<p>Blood smeared on the ground. The fact that Morales was really dead reminded Sanchez of the words he said to Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>“You don’t know the value of that position. There are many warriors in Valhalla who will give anything to stand on that stage. Please tell me something. Do you think you are qualified to deal with Barbossa on behalf of Morales?”</p>
<p>At that time, he believed in those thoughts. He didn’t deny the fact that Roman Dmitry had accomplished a lot of things, but he didn’t think he was up to par with the top Rankers yet.</p>
<p>What did Roman Dmitry feel upon hearing those words? With the ability to overwhelm Morales with this much, Sanchez’s words must have been nothing more than presumptuous remarks.</p>
<p>‘… Teacher.’</p>
<p>He looked at Morales and cried. He wanted to vent his anger over his death, but Morales showed genuine joy in his last moments.</p>
<p>Recently, Morales has been saying something. He said that Valhalla was going in the wrong direction, and at some point, the people had lost their worth as warriors. Those who pursued pure confrontation had lost their place in the empire.</p>
<p>Those who clung to power and played the role of head prospered, while those who risked their lives on the battlefield died alone, giving up all their achievements.</p>
<p>It was a country that lost its mark. The values that Valhalla pursued had changed, and Morales hoped for a fight with Barbossa.</p>
<p>“Sanchez. I might die in the fight with Barbossa. No, the odds of me winning are slim. Still, there is a reason to fight him. The people of Valhalla are the warriors of Valhalla. I hope you see my struggle and realize the essence of the past, even a little bit. What kind of nation was Valhalla? At least, it wasn’t a nation that persecuted the weak while asserting power.”</p>
<p>Risking his life, he said he would die in a meaningful manner, and he showed the same eyes in the fight with Roman Dmitry. So, in the middle of the fight, he knew Morales would die. In order for Roman Dmitry to truly gain recognition and head to the stage, he needed a scapegoat for his fame, and that was Morales.</p>
<p>At that moment, he was determined to die. In the first place, he used his body, which he was having trouble with due to his rough life, as a flame to shine on Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>So Sanchez gritted his teeth and held his tears back, knowing Morales’s intentions. Roman Dmitry was a talented person who deserved respect.</p>
<p>‘I understand Teacher’s intentions, but this is too irresponsible. If you go away like that for the sake of some great cause, what am I going to do after I have lived all my life looking at Teacher alone? Even knowing the value that comes first as a warrior, I hate Teacher. It is hard for me to accept an honorable death as a warrior, but I will not let your death be in vain.’</p>
<p>Before the confrontation, Morales left a comment. If he truly died, he had to check the ‘will’ he left behind. It was then….</p>
<p>“Ro… man, Ro… man!”</p>
<p>“Roman, Roman!”</p>
<p>“Roman, Roman, Roman!”</p>
<p>The people of Valhalla, like a heatwave spreading, began to chant Roman Dmitry’s name.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Morales’s defeat shocked the general public, and they couldn’t get the words that Morales had spoken out of their heads.</p>
<p>“…Were Morales’s words true?”</p>
<p>“If the Valhalla imperial family did summon Roman Dmitry for their personal revenge, it is so wrong. The festival of warriors is a place for the souls of the dead warriors, and it shouldn’t be polluted like this.”</p>
<p>“Even if they died with honor, if one of them looked down from heaven and saw such a situation happening, they wouldn’t be able to close their eyes in peace.”</p>
<p>It was a disaster—the truth about Valhalla. Roman Dmitry, on the contrary, looked more suited to Valhalla than the people of Valhalla.</p>
<p>Without avoiding anything, he proudly set foot in Valhalla. When people looked at him with prejudice, he accepted their challenge, knowing that he might be injured before the match.</p>
<p>What kind of warrior was like that? Roman killed many people, but people thought of that as a moment to prove the meaning of Valhalla’s existence.</p>
<p>Morales was dead. He was an existence that showed what a real warrior should be like in a world that was losing its essence. The people were not sad. They were happy.</p>
<p>A warrior dying as a warrior and returning to a handful of dirt in the hands of a worthy opponent. Knowing that it was an honorable death that everyone wanted, they weren’t going to stain the warrior’s death with tears.</p>
<p>It was then that….</p>
<p>“Ro… man, Ro… man!”</p>
<p>Each one of them just unknowingly shouted Roman’s name. Standing tall as a victor, he truly deserved the respect of the people of Valhalla.</p>
<p>“Roman! Roman! Roman!”</p>
<p>“Roman! Roman!”</p>
<p>Their voices spread like a fever. The people recognized Roman Dmitry. Roman Dmitry, who defeated Morales, was an outsider, but he was more suitable for the festival’s stage.</p>
<p>Abandoning prejudice, if one was strong and knew the worth of a warrior, his origins didn’t matter at all.</p>
<p>The current Valhalla was a nation where racial discrimination was pointed out as a problem, but at one time, they were a nation that introduced the ‘Ranking System’ to the continent in pursuit of a pure fight between warriors.</p>
<p>The fight between Morales and Roman ignited their forgotten values, and the voices calling for Roman Dmitry grew louder and louder in their desire.</p>
<p>As Morales said, they would open their eyes and not turn a blind eye to reality. The souls of the warriors of Valhalla were watching. They would watch the showdown between Barbossa and Roman until the end so that they wouldn’t embarrass them even a little.</p>
<p>The people were passionate.</p>
<p>At the center of this, Roman Dmitry showed respect for the dead by accepting their cheers.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The world was shaken. At the moment when Morales’s death struck Marin, a discussion was happening among the power holders in Marin.</p>
<p>“…The rumor seems to be true. Morales lost against Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>It was Viscount Jonathan.</p>
<p>Hearing his report, the Marquis of Belfir, the leader of one of Valhalla’s powers, smiled.</p>
<p>“Things are becoming funny. Even when he accepted the invitation, I didn’t think his goal of winning against Barbossa would work. But to think he was strong enough to defeat Morales. I tried not to underestimate his skills, but this is beyond what I thought.”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was an absurdly strong man. He didn’t know that his dispute with Valhalla would end like this. And Viscount Jonathan said,</p>
<p>“If you give me an order, I will use my hands to make Roman Dmitry go on stage with an ’unnatural body.”</p>
<p>“No, there is no need for that.”</p>
<p>Morales—the man was a nuisance. He was always on the other side of the power forces and raised his voice against them.</p>
<p>“Why do you think Morales died? He had the option to see the reality. But he accepted the sacrifice, challenged Roman Dmitry, and accepted his death too. It is a trick to prevent anyone from intervening in the fight between Roman and Barbossa. People clearly witnessed Roman Dmitry’s power, and if he shows a weakened form on the day of the fight, they will have doubts.”</p>
<p>They didn’t normally care about the opinions of the public. But in a situation where the public’s opinion was on the verge of exploding, they knew doing the wrong thing would be a problem.</p>
<p>Valhalla—the nation of warriors was different from before. Now, they consider political issues when making decisions.</p>
<p>Marquis Belfir, who was looking out of the window with a calm face, recalled the past he had buried.</p>
<p>“Viscount Jonathan. How much do you know about Barbossa?”</p>
<p>“Well, isn’t he a member of the Twelve Swords that represent the continent and our Valhalla?”</p>
<p>“Right, most people know that. However, the true weapon he wields isn’t a sword.”</p>
<p>“… What do you mean?”</p>
<p>Barbossa and Morales. The clash between the two of them. In their first fight, it was because of Barbossa himself, not his background.</p>
<p>“Barbossa is a clever person. While being confident in his win, he does everything possible to eliminate even a 1% chance of being defeated. So, let’s leave the confrontation with Roman Dmitry entirely to Barbossa. He knows how to increase his chances in the right way.”</p>
<p>In the fight against Barbossa, Morales was defeated. He didn’t evade the responsibility, but he thought that the outcome of the fight would have been different if his physical condition had been normal.</p>
<p>However, was that really how it was? In the past and even now, Barbossa would overpower Morales. Even if he were confident of winning against Barbossa, the guy would gnaw at his opponent.</p>
<p>In the fast-changing Valhalla, Barbossa was the representative of today’s world.</p>
<p>Marquis Belfir laughed.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>No matter how desperately he tried, he wouldn’t return home with a living body.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was a long day. The fight, which had been happening since early morning, ended with Morales’s death.</p>
<p>No one expressed their intention to challenge Roman anymore. If he had defeated Morales, who was originally supposed to be on the festival’s stage, they didn’t need to test Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>On that evening, Sanchez found Dmitry. His face contorted, and he bowed his head right away.</p>
<p>“… Mr. Roman Dmitry, I am sorry for insulting you all the way. Knowing how bad prejudice can be, I couldn’t tolerate an outsider being on our stage. Regardless of who wins or loses in the match, I respect your choice of going onto the stage despite knowing what the intentions of Valhalla are.”</p>
<p>There was no hostility. Morales’s death, and Roman Dmitry were two different things. The people of Valhalla didn’t turn their backs on the opponents who died in fights.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“Let’s forget about the past. After the fight with Morales, I have no hard feelings for you.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>When the fight was over, the emotions of the past were engraved into his body. And the way he respected Valhalla, Sanchez showed a determined look in his eyes.</p>
<p>“The reason I came for Roman Dmitry like this is because of my teacher’s will. Teacher recognized your true warrior spirit. That is why he accepted death from you, and when he went on the stage, he revealed the ugly truth of Valhalla to the people so they would know the spirit of Valhalla.”</p>
<p>After the fight was over, he went back to his place. After reading Morales’s will, which he had left in case something happened, Sanchez could not hide his embarrassed feelings.</p>
<p>It was not just a will. It had shocking content. Morales wanted Roman Dmitry to know the truth, even if his own death would be meaningless.</p>
<p>“Teacher left this will, saying that Roman Dmitry should be fully aware of the dangers of the fight. Roman Dmitry. Valhalla’s plan doesn’t just end with the fight against Barbossa. Even if you defeat him in the battle, the life of Roman Dmitry cannot be guaranteed.”</p>
<p>After he read the will, Sanchez let out a sigh.</p>
<p>Valhalla was down. Even if an individual raised his voice, a rotten nation wouldn’t care about it. The foundation of the nation had become rotten. Despite knowing that, Morales risked his life to bring forth an alternative.</p>
<p>“Inviting Mr. Roman Dmitry to this festival. It is part of the Kronos Empire’s plan. Teacher told me in his will that some powerful people in Valhalla had colluded with Kronos. So, if you want to survive, leave Valhalla right now. I will help you with that part. If you take on the stage of the match, a wounded Mr. Roman Dmitry will never be able to return to Dmitry alive.”</p>
<p>With a voice suppressing his anger, he spoke of the ugly truth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 235 - Festival For Festival (6)</p>
<p>It was a shame. Sanchez questioned if Roman Dmitry was even qualified to be on the stage, but in the first place, the Valhalla Empire brutally trampled on the meaning of their festival.</p>
<p>Even though changing the warrior to represent the festival was a sensitive issue, for political gain, Valhalla accepted the request of the Kronos Empire and changed the opponent. It felt so pathetic.</p>
<p>How did their nation turn into this?</p>
<p>‘This must be the reason why Teacher didn’t compromise with the Valhalla royal family. If he had become their puppet, he would have been given a comfortable life, but like Barbossa, he would have had to fight against those he didn’t want to fight. Now I can understand why Teacher hated those who were seeking change in the nation. Teacher wasn’t afraid of change, he just hated those idiots on the high chairs who took everything in their control.’</p>
<p>Morales wanted Roman Dmitry to have the stage. If it was his skills that overpowered him, he would show the pride of a warrior by taking down Barbossa.</p>
<p>However, the truth couldn’t be hidden. It would be a pragmatic way to limit one option of Valhalla, but Morales provided a sure way for Roman to survive. Either way, it was a divisive option.</p>
<p>Just because those in power were bad, Morales didn’t want to fight like them.</p>
<p>Then Sanchez learned the truth. He told the truth on behalf of the dead, and he assumed Roman would take the safe way out.</p>
<p>It was expected. The death of Morales made Roman Dmitry shine, and if he went to a faraway nation, he wouldn’t be at risk with Valhalla’s plan.</p>
<p>However, Roman Dmitry’s reaction wasn’t what he had expected.</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>“… What? Do you mean you knew that Valhalla was talking to Kronos?”</p>
<p>It was shocking. Roman Dmitry set foot in Valhalla despite knowing the ugly truth, and he continued.</p>
<p>“The relationship between Kronos and Valhalla is a strange one. People think Valhalla acts like a bystander, but in fact, what they’re doing can’t just be described as being a bystander. It is something that you will understand if you look at the civil war in Cairo. If Marquis Benedict succeeded with the rebellion and the regime changed, the Kronos Empire would have used Cairo as a bridge to start their continental conquest. If Valhalla had gone against Kronos at that time, what does that even mean then? It holds no meaning. Bystanders don’t give advantages to others. To think that one preserves one’s power just by watching is the idea of ​​weak people who have never held power.”</p>
<p>Between the relationships of the empires, a small doubt formed. People said that the empires regarded each other as a huge block in their plans, but the two would never hurt each other. It was like they were acknowledging the existence of each other.</p>
<p>“I don’t think the relationship between the two empires is one of perfect alliance. In the end, each of them is a force that holds a large piece of land. If a certain level is exceeded, then the two would also have to fight. However, until the surrounding forces are fully sorted out, there is enough reason for them to join forces. Considering such a premise, it leads to the conclusion that Valhalla isn’t just watching on the sidelines.”</p>
<p>“… What?”</p>
<p>Sanchez took a deep breath, as it felt like he was the one running out of air. Roman Dmitry spoke calmly, but as someone from Valhalla, he was shocked.</p>
<p>Valhalla was a nation of warriors. They had thoughts and passion, and they followed what they believed in. That was a good way to say it, and Valhalla, which was closed, was called a nation of no communication.</p>
<p>But Sanchez still liked Valhalla. Even though Valhalla’s methods might not be the same as those of the people outside, Valhalla pursued its own way and represented the souls of warriors. If what Roman said was true—no, even according to Morales’s will, if that was true, then Sanchez felt miserable.</p>
<p>It was the opposite. To join hands with Kronos, whom they have been criticizing, even if they fought a battle with Kronos later, it wasn’t an important issue for Valhalla.</p>
<p>If Kronos loved the results, then Valhalla loved the process. Rather than winning, they were hoping for a worthy defeat.</p>
<p>Sanchez said,</p>
<p>“Why accept the invitation from Valhalla when you knew it? This is a plan that Valhalla and Kronos have colluded on. After the fight with Barbossa is over, it is certain that the forces trying to kill Roman Dmitry will move. Can you handle it? I admit that you are strong, but you have limits. The Warp Gate leading to Dmitry would have some problems, and running on foot would be impossible.”</p>
<p>His voice trembled. He was asking sincerely, and Roman Dmitry showed a calm face.</p>
<p>“I accepted it because I knew the truth.”</p>
<p>“… Are you being serious right now?”</p>
<p>“Even if the truth hidden beneath the surface is revealed, it wouldn’t change the reality that I am confronting. And it is a reality that has to be dealt with at some point. In order for the weak nations on the continent, including Dmitry, to defend their nation, they need to start ignoring and denying the fact that Valhalla and Kronos are shaking hands.”</p>
<p>It was the worst theory. Going to Valhalla was risky, but there was a reason for him to do it.</p>
<p>“I hope that my actions in the future give cause for war. Even if Valhalla deliberately lured me into Kronos’s trap and tried to kill me, how would people react if I defeated one of the Twelve Swords of the continent and went back home alive? The change starts from there. Even if the ugly truth is revealed, people will only have a reason to fight until the end.”</p>
<p>Sanchez was speechless. Roman Dmitry was a reckless man that even Valhalla would call crazy.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The conversation ended, and Roman Dmitry didn’t run away. Recalling the image of him saying he would go onto the stage, Sanchez went out and looked at the moon in darkness.</p>
<p>“… Roman Dmitry, you are insane.”</p>
<p>His heart raced. During this festival, Barbossa’s victory was guaranteed. Although it was said that he defeated Morales, Barbossa was six levels higher than Morales in the ranking, which showed a huge difference in each level.</p>
<p>Even if he would take the risk and bring his opponent down, what greets Roman Dmitry after he gets off the stage isn’t the cheers of people but a black future. Yet he still wanted to fight.</p>
<p>He chuckled. Even though it was such a risky thing, Roman Dmitry actually gave him hope that it would work out.</p>
<p>One time, Morales said,</p>
<p>“A true warrior doesn’t tolerate a single precedent. Not just because no one is watching, but because it is a choice everyone can understand. If they neglect their training and compromise with reality, their weakness will eventually make them fall to their knees and put their heads to the ground in a battle determined by will. I am not great. Despite knowing Barbossa was in the wrong, the time I neglected all of it proves how weak I am. Sanchez, if you meet a true warrior, learn about the life he lived. Even if you can’t live like that, you will learn something in the days to come.”</p>
<p>A true warrior. He was the existence that Morales spoke about. Roman Dmitry seemed like such a great being from the history of Valhalla.</p>
<p>He walked through the night.</p>
<p>‘I don’t think of it as being reckless. But if what he said to me was true, when he defeats Barbossa, I hope he doesn’t get killed by those empire dogs.’</p>
<p>Morales, his teacher, might have wished for the same. If he chose the path of a warrior even after he was told about the alternative, then he should be devoting himself to Roman.</p>
<p>He gritted his teeth.</p>
<p>Maybe, from now on, it would seem like he would have to spend some intense time.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The day before the festival was bright, with people moving around since the morning. With the festival being held tomorrow, there were many things that had to be taken care of today.</p>
<p>On that evening, as the sun went down, people began to flock to the festival site. People surrounded the huge stage, and each of them showed their anticipation.</p>
<p>“Who will win?”</p>
<p>“It has to be Gonzales of the Jonathan family. On the stage of the eve where the Rankers do not participate, it is safe to say that unless there’s a 4-star swordsman that participates, he wouldn’t have any opponents there. Besides, rumor has it that Gonzales will be challenging the rankings soon.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that man. Still, on the eve of the stage, one cannot predict the outcome. It is not a one-on-one match, but thirty at the same time.”</p>
<p>The people were talking. Then someone mentioned the hottest topic.</p>
<p>“How about Dmitry’s Flash?”</p>
<p>“… Hmm. I am looking forward to him, but maybe he is lacking a bit compared with the others.”</p>
<p>“Still, I heard that Dmitry’s Flash showed an overwhelming presence in the fight against the Kronos Empire. How swift his sword technique is. The people who have watched him fight think of the word flash even without hearing about the rumors.”</p>
<p>“He is definitely someone to remember. Considering that Roman Dmitry, whom he serves, brought down Morales, Chris might not be ordinary either.”</p>
<p>Just a day ago, Chris wasn’t the center of attention. He was just an uninvited guest mixed in with the festival happenings, but Roman Dmitry’s actions drew attention to him as well.</p>
<p>He was the only stranger, yet all of the attention focused on him. However, it was a fact that everyone thought that his chances of winning were low.</p>
<p>“Still, winning will be difficult. It is not easy for someone from a foreign nation to come and win our event on our land. The warriors of Valhalla must be wary of Chris, knowingly or unknowingly, but in a situation where thirty warriors are fighting at the same time, will a miracle happen? Maybe in order to survive, he will have no choice but to respond in defense from start to end.”</p>
<p>It was one person’s words, but that was what the people’s honest evaluation of Chris was.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The time had come. At the call of the referee, the warriors representing each family took their positions.</p>
<p>“Chris from the Dmitry Duchy!”</p>
<p>“OHHHH!”</p>
<p>“Chris! Chris!”</p>
<p>“Chris! Chris!”</p>
<p>The people were excited. Most of the people weren’t sure of Chris’s victory, but that didn’t mean they were going to reject him. Roman Dmitry was recognized as a true warrior, and the people of Valhalla were going to scream their throats out for Chris just for the sake of Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>That was the situation, and among the warriors there, several didn’t like it.</p>
<p>“<em>Tch.</em> Cheering for a total stranger.”</p>
<p>“Even if I die here, I cannot see someone who isn’t from Valhalla winning here.”</p>
<p>It was as people had expected. Just as people didn’t like Roman as Barbossa’s opponent, Chris was going through the same thing. Some warriors felt ashamed of the fact that an unproven warrior was being put on the same stage as them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, they received a special order from the lords of the families.</p>
<p>“If you win on the stage on the eve, it will be a great joy, but even if you lose, keep this in mind. Chris. Kill that stranger who followed Roman Dmitry here at all costs. If you succeed in doing that, apart from winning, I will take full responsibility for your family.”</p>
<p>The killing intent lingered in their eyes. Chris was the common enemy. They knew each of them had a similar purpose just by looking into each other’s eyes, and one warrior spoke in a hushed voice.</p>
<p>“Probably, Dmitry’s rat is more likely to be defensive from the start. In a situation where he is dealing with the warriors of Valhalla, he will not be able to save his life. So why don’t we drench the stage of Valhalla with the blood of an outsider? I think it would be better to decide the winner of the match after we take him down.”</p>
<p>“I agree.”</p>
<p>“Nice. We will take down the stranger first and chew him up.”</p>
<p>The warriors laughed. They all had the same opinions. Even though they would have to take each other’s lives next, achieving a common goal felt good.</p>
<p>Finally, the high-ranking nobles, including the Emperor, were all seated. At the signal that everything was ready, the referee raised the flag.</p>
<p><em>Flutter.</em></p>
<p>“Start!”</p>
<p>The signal announcing the start of the eve of the festival was given. The people went crazy, and it was then….</p>
<p><em>Pat.</em></p>
<p>Someone moved.</p>
<p>It was Chris. Contrary to everyone’s expectations that he would move defensively, he ran straight into the warriors first.</p>
<p>And then….</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>Cutting the throat of the warrior, who wasn’t even ready…</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>He also slashed the throat of the warrior next to him.</p>
<p><em>Puak!</em></p>
<p>Then he tore the chest of the warrior who was right next to him, and blood gushed out like a fountain.</p>
<p>The people were shocked. It was an attack that was so fast that it was hard for the naked eye to see. As soon as it started, three warriors were knocked down, and blood dripped from Chris’s sword.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 236 - Festival For Festival (7)</p>
<p>On the day that Roman Dmitry returned from meeting Viscount Jonathan, he notified Chris of the news of his participation on the eve of the festival. Also, he mentioned the conspiracy of the Valhalla Empire.</p>
<p>“They will try to kill you on the stage. If Barbossa doesn’t win the match between him and me, as they have expected, they must be intending to cut down my strong limbs before they grow further in the future. However, despite knowing that fact, I accepted the offer from the empire.”</p>
<p>Chris didn’t ask. Roman Dmitry was informing him of the danger that would come from this incident, but it sounded like he trusted him. It was overwhelming. It was a dangerous position, but it was worth going to.</p>
<p>“Chris. This trip to Valhalla has been a series of dangers from the start until the end. Valhalla will never stay still from making us stop and head back to Dmitry, but we need to be sending a clear message through this. Both on the eve and on the main stage of the festival. If we defeat the warriors of Valhalla and win, and if we go through the enemies and return alive, the value of those who follow and trust Dmitry will be unshakable.”</p>
<p>Someone might ask him, did he have to go that far? Even if he had refused Valhalla’s invitation from the start, Roman Dmitry had already created a bond of trust with them.</p>
<p>In a safe place, giving orders was enough. If Roman Dmitry’s goals could have been safe from the ambitions of the empire, there might have been other options too. But the purpose of this was different from the start.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry considered the empire, which people thought was untouchable, as an ‘equal opponent,’ and therefore, he didn’t want to step back even a little. If they attacked him, he would hit them back the same way.</p>
<p>Their dirty conspiracies—even if he knew about them, he would trample on them. His decisions, which others called reckless, would surely become a springboard for higher goals.</p>
<p>And Roman Dmitry said,</p>
<p>“I will defeat Barbossa so that not a single person questions us. So you will also head out on stage on the eve of the festival to prove your existence. I don’t want cowardly wins. Cut the heads of all twenty-nine warriors with your own hands so that no one will doubt the sword of Roman Dmitry.”</p>
<p>The order fell. It was a mission for which he had to risk his life, yet Chris raised his voice, feeling excited.</p>
<p>“According to your order, I will raise the fame and name of Dmitry on the stage on the festival’s eve.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cutting the heads of twenty-nine people was a reckless order. Rationally, it was absolutely impossible, but he had no doubt about the fact that it was Roman Dmitry’s order.</p>
<p>Trust. Even when he first stepped out as a warrior at Lawrence, it led to victory in a match that people thought was impossible. Looking back at the steps he had taken until now, there wasn’t a single thing he did that felt possible.</p>
<p>When the Southern Front collapsed because of Hector, the war against the rebels led by Marquis Benedict, and the all-out war with the Kronos Empire—each of them produced a huge result that would be written down in history.</p>
<p>A person’s limit was determined by their experience. Even the warriors of Valhalla were trying to save themselves at the beginning, but Chris had a completely different idea.</p>
<p>‘To cut down all twenty-nine people, I can’t hesitate at all. I have to deal with the enemies from the start and let them be wary of me. Come to me so that I can swiftly cut your exposed necks.’</p>
<p>His defeat was ruled out. A strong desire rose, and Chris kicked the ground.</p>
<p>At the unexpected sight, the warrior who tried to respond swiftly had his neck slashed.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>‘Flash.’</p>
<p>Extreme Swift Sword.</p>
<p>The opponent couldn’t even properly check how to wield his sword. When the other warriors looked confused at the head floating in the air, Chris jumped up and cut off another warrior’s head.</p>
<p>It all happened in an instant. Less than 10 seconds had passed since the flag was waved, and the audience burst into cheers.</p>
<p>“WOAHHHHHHH!”</p>
<p>“INSANE!!!!!”</p>
<p>“Chris! Go!”</p>
<p>At that fleeting moment, all the warriors turned to Chris. Even though they weren’t together, they instinctively realized that they had to deal with the most prominent being.</p>
<p>Thirty fights—the stage on the festival’s eve was like that. They noticed each other and minimized battling with others, except for Chris.</p>
<p><em>Roarrrr.</em></p>
<p>“Come on.”</p>
<p>No matter how the others reacted, Chris didn’t stop. He raised his aura high, dealt with those who blocked him, and avoided the attack of the opponents with a simple step.</p>
<p>All of them were swordsmen, representing each family. There were various swordsmen from 2 to 4-stars, but they couldn’t respond to Chris’s attack.</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>And a head was cut off. As he noticed it but wasn’t able to respond, Chris’s sword technique entered the realm of irrationality.</p>
<p>In the last few months, Roman Dmitry foreshadowed a special training. The soldiers showed expectations for growth even though they knew it would be difficult, but within a few minutes, their excitement was crushed.</p>
<p>In addition to the tight training schedule, Chris always had Roman Dmitry as a sparring partner, and when Roman Dmitry would fight against him in a one-on-one fight or one against all of them.</p>
<p>He coughed up blood, and his face was disfigured. Chris was proud that he had developed in his own way, but when he closed his eyes and opened them, the blue sky filled his field of vision.</p>
<p>It was a grueling time. He knew that Roman Dmitry was a special person, but when he faced him in person, he realized he was an opponent Chris couldn’t follow.</p>
<p>If the difference between them were of this level, they wouldn’t know if they would be much of a help to Roman Dmitry in the future.</p>
<p>That was why Roman Dmitry’s soldiers were desperate. Even if he was beaten terribly every day, he didn’t choose any means or methods to somehow become stronger with eyes full of poison.</p>
<p>It was a series of days when he couldn’t sleep properly. At night, after the assassination arranged by Roman Dmitry, he stayed awake all night, and the day of the decisive battle dawned before he knew it.</p>
<p>In the present, Chris’s sword became sharp. His senses were at their peak, and he reacted sensitively to the enemy’s attacks.</p>
<p><em>Grrrrr.</em></p>
<p><em>Euk.</em></p>
<p>His life was at risk from all sides. As one warrior swung his sword to decapitate him, another one attacked Chris from behind. The warriors’ simultaneous attack wasn’t intentional, but because Chris was at the front, they all chose to attack at the same time.</p>
<p>‘Behind.’</p>
<p><em>Flash.</em></p>
<p>He cut the first swordsman, then he turned around. As he looked at the eyes of the warrior, which were full of shock, Chris cut off his head.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p>Blood fell like rain. Chris’s body heated up. The sight of an enemy killed at the hands of another warrior caught his eye more than the danger he was in.</p>
<p>‘Will I fail to deal with all twenty-nine warriors with my own hands?’</p>
<p>What could he do? Just stick to reality.</p>
<p>Chris kicked the ground. There were still many enemies he had to deal with.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When he had dealt with exactly eight enemies, Chris instinctively raised his sword to block an attack.</p>
<p><em>Kwang!</em></p>
<p><em>Krrrrrrng.</em></p>
<p>“A fucking bug, without knowing the subject, is running rampant.”</p>
<p>It was Gonzales. Following Viscount Jonathan, he looked at Chris and revealed his murderous intent.</p>
<p>“I get upset whenever I see people like you. Those born in small nations compete with one another, so they constantly think they are the best. It is like that. Otherwise, you wouldn’t dare act like this on the stage against Valhalla’s warriors.”</p>
<p>It was a special order. Viscount Jonathan told him to kill Chris, but he already didn’t like him even if he wasn’t given the order. It was a stage where he had to be the main character. He was genuinely angry at the spotlight that Chris was getting.</p>
<p>“I’ll make it impossible for you to run amok anymore.”</p>
<p><em>Wheik.</em></p>
<p><em>Grrrrng!</em></p>
<p>His 4-star aura exploded. It was different from the overwhelming force that the previous opponents had.</p>
<p>The moment the air around the aura distorted to pressure Chris, a light flashed in his eyes. He felt goosebumps rise for a moment. He instinctively turned his head, and he felt a stinging shock near his eyes.</p>
<p><em>Pak.</em></p>
<p>“…?!”</p>
<p>The attack just now couldn’t be seen. He expected the other warriors to collapse, but Chris’s attack was faster than he had expected. Gonzales bit his teeth and increased his speed.</p>
<p>As if proving that he wasn’t slow compared to Chris, he blocked the space that the opponent could use to attack, and an aura flashed. Everyone’s attention was focused on that part of the fight, and it looked like Gonzales was pushing Chris back one-sidedly.</p>
<p>However, Gonzales felt something strange. In terms of aura, he had the advantage, but Chris didn’t show any signs of being shaken by the swarming attacks.</p>
<p>Chris’s sparring partner was Roman Dmitry. He was a monster who was able to kill Morales at once. Roman Dmitry pushed Chris to the limit each time, and due to that experience, the 4-star aura wasn’t a threat.</p>
<p>But that didn’t mean that it wasn’t dangerous. Indeed, in a showdown of power, Gonzales had the upper hand, but Chris knew that aura wasn’t absolute. No matter how strong someone was, the winner would be the one who could cut down the other’s body first.</p>
<p>Chris calmly responded to the opponent’s attack, then extended his sword in a lightning-swift movement.</p>
<p>“What!”</p>
<p><em>Grrrng!</em></p>
<p>Gonzales’s reaction was swift. The moment he tried to block Chris’s attack and retrieve his sword, he witnessed a smile on Chris’s lips.</p>
<p><em>Kwaang!</em></p>
<p>Aura Explosion. Chris created his own technique by using Roman Dmitry’s cleverness in battle and the secret technique that Knights’ Captain Jonathan taught him.</p>
<p>Both were skills that pursued extreme speed, and in order to defeat enemies stronger than him in the coming chaos, he was trying to utilize both of their positive points.</p>
<p>At first, he would use the power to rush through space and then use mana right after. At that moment, when the enemy would react, he would change the direction of his attack and use Knight Commander Jonathan’s dodging technique.</p>
<p>There were two explosions. Roman Dmitry, who confirmed the technique, looked down at Chris and said,</p>
<p>“Wonderful.”</p>
<p>Chris built his own world. His sword, which drew an odd path, blew away Gonzales’s head, which was stained with shock.</p>
<p><em>Puak.</em></p>
<p>Blood splashed, and the people were shocked. Gonzales was someone whom everyone determined to be a candidate for the championship, and they never imagined his head would be cut off so easily.</p>
<p>‘There are nine people now.’</p>
<p>Yet he was feeling hungry for more. Gonzales was just one of the nine.</p>
<p>To Chris, defeating an opponent stronger than himself didn’t hold a special meaning.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It was something no one could imagine. It was so different from Roman Dmitry. If Roman Dmitry had been defeating Rankers all this time, the reputation of the person called Dmitry’s Flash was as insignificant as a stone on the side of the street.</p>
<p>3-star—it was a skill that one couldn’t hope to win with. Everyone thought so, but the way Chris showed it was thrilling to them.</p>
<p>“Die!”</p>
<p><em>Grrrng!</em></p>
<p>The warriors rushed from all sides. The end of the eve of the festival was always like this. The remaining warriors would join forces to defeat a potential winner, and that opponent was Chris, whom they considered a stranger.</p>
<p>Chris didn’t retreat a single step from the enemies’ attacks. Even if roaring auras were heading towards him, he faced them head-on, avoiding their attacks and slashing them back.</p>
<p>Blood splashed. Chris, who was drenched in blood before realizing it, was in a state of trance as he exchanged clashes with the enemies.</p>
<p>Each time his sword moved, the enemies died. Seeing him step on each of them, the people began to cheer for Chris.</p>
<p>“Chris! Chris!”</p>
<p>“Chris! Chris!”</p>
<p>It wasn’t because of Roman Dmitry’s background. It was because of Chris himself. He rightly deserved the recognition.</p>
<p>When people’s emotions reached their peak, Chris finally cut off the head of the last enemy.</p>
<p><em>Clench.</em></p>
<p>That was the end. The people went crazy. On the stage where blood had rained, the winner who survived until the end was an outsider. And everyone focused on him.</p>
<p>Now, it was the winner’s turn to show courtesy to the Emperor and receive honor and wealth.</p>
<p>However, Chris knelt down and offered his sword.</p>
<p>“That!”</p>
<p>“W-What is that?”</p>
<p>The people were shocked.</p>
<p>The one at the end of Chris’s gaze wasn’t the Emperor of Valhalla, but Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 237 - Way Of The Predator (1)</p>
<p>Chris’s actions were disrespectful. This was the land of the empire. In a place and situation where no one should look down on the Valhalla Empire’s Emperor, Chris paid his respects to Roman first, and this made the atmosphere frozen cold. Even those who had been cheering for Chris’s performance until a moment ago kept silent and looked at the Emperor.</p>
<p>At that moment, Roman raised his hand, and at the sight of his loyalty being accepted, Chris finally shifted his gaze to the Emperor. He got on his knees, but he didn’t offer his sword.</p>
<p>It was a cheeky act. The faces of the high-ranking nobles, who sat near the table of the Emperor, were red, but they couldn’t say anything until the Emperor did anything.</p>
<p>Valhalla was the same as Kronos. In a nation where the Emperor had absolute power, they couldn’t recklessly raise their voices in front of the Emperor.</p>
<p>“Your name was Chris?”</p>
<p>Finally, the Emperor opened his mouth. If the Emperor of Kronos was violent and had a cold atmosphere, the Emperor of Valhalla spoke in a languid tone, not befitting the reputation of a warrior’s country.</p>
<p>His outside appearance was also ugly. His body seemed to be in bad condition, probably because he hadn’t undergone any special physical training, and his sunken eyes seemed dark.</p>
<p>“Yes, it is Chris.”</p>
<p>“Amazing. It isn’t easy for a stranger from a foreign nation to win on the stage on the eve of the festival, but to actively decapitate the heads of the warriors and remain as the final winner. I also expected a boring match where we had to find something interesting to see, but thanks to you, I watched the stage with excitement.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“To thank me for that.”</p>
<p>The Emperor grinned and laughed. He displayed a strange feeling of madness. Even though he didn’t show any special words or signs, the Emperor had this air around him that could make people nervous.</p>
<p>“But you see. Just now, why did you bow to Roman Dmitry? <em>Sigh.</em> I don’t mean to reprimand you. I have no intention of imposing the laws of the empire on people from other nations. It is just plain curiosity. In front of me, people who act like you are not so common.”</p>
<p>He was a bit frivolous.</p>
<p>In an excited voice with no weight, Chris said,</p>
<p>“… Because it is a stage for my Lord. Just as the Valhalla warriors gave up their lives for the Emperor, I also risked mine for my Lord. There is no other reason.”</p>
<p>“Hoo.”</p>
<p>The Emperor made a sound of admiration. His eyes, which gazed at Chris, had changed.</p>
<p>“You are still at a young age, yet you possess outstanding skills and even blind loyalty towards your Lord. Such an amazing talent. Valhalla is a nation that has treated talented people well since ancient times. People say that our nation doesn’t welcome outsiders, but actually, it is only outsiders who have no skills. Valhalla can do anything to recruit talent like you. Money, if you want money. Honor if you want honor, and women if you want women. Valhalla is a paradise for those who have talent.”</p>
<p>His laughter turned deep. He was not asking Chris to take responsibility for his attitude, yet the conversation was moving in an odd direction.</p>
<p>“How about it? Swear allegiance to me right now, and I will give you a reward that will overwhelm anything that Dmitry had promised you.”</p>
<p>The words of the Emperor had crossed the line.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Groans and sighs could be heard from everywhere. In front of the whole nation, his statement about openly recruiting a person was worse than what Chris did by bowing to Roman.</p>
<p>In his sudden and unexpected action, if Chris hadn’t known what kind of person the Emperor of Valhalla was, he would have been a bit flustered and shocked.</p>
<p>The Emperor of Valhalla. As the 14th son of the previous Emperor, who gave birth to as many as twenty-three sons, he was a cruel figure who ascended to the position of the throne by taking the lives of even his youngest siblings in the battle for the throne.</p>
<p>On a day covered in darkness, a bloody wind blew into the imperial family. As his sword was dripping with blood, the Emperor of Valhalla killed all the bloodlines in his family.</p>
<p>Hence, the people said that the only opponent of Valhalla now was Kronos. Despite knowing that fact, the reason they couldn’t actively move was that the rumors about the mad nature of the Valhalla Emperor were well known.</p>
<p>And it was worse when Kronos revealed their ambition to conquer the continent. They couldn’t help but say that Valhalla was the lesser evil.</p>
<p>Unlike Kronos, there were not that many cases where they invaded the borders of other nations, so many people who didn’t know the situation in Valhalla fell into the illusion that it was just a nation of warriors and thought the Valhalla Empire was good.</p>
<p>However, the reality was that it was evil and more extreme than expected. In a world where the weak get eaten and are dominated by the strong, the top position is occupied by an abnormal person.</p>
<p>“Chris, make your choice.”</p>
<p>Even so, people agreed that the Emperor of Valhalla’s offer was attractive. His choice would mean a rise in his status.</p>
<p>It was a fact that everyone acknowledged that the Emperor was a brutal person, but the reason he could stay in his current power was that he rewarded the people based on their abilities.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a lie to say that heaven was for those who had the ability. The reason why talents from the continent flowed into Valhalla through the ranking system was that the heaven-like daily life that was experienced by a few people in Valhalla was very nice.</p>
<p>Between the conservatives and the liberals, the Emperor was in the middle. At times, both sides would agree, but what was certain was that both forces were composed of talented people suitable for the empire.</p>
<p>Their gazes were focused. Everyone was sure of Chris’s answer. No matter what the true nature of Valhalla was, there was no reason for someone chosen by the Emperor to refuse him. The moment he accepted it, the heavens would open, and Valhalla would take the winner.</p>
<p>However, Chris answered differently from their thoughts.</p>
<p>“… I apologize, but I refuse.”</p>
<p>“Why so?”</p>
<p>“The present me, whom His Majesty values now, wouldn’t have reached this state if it weren’t for the teachings of my Lord. The value that the empire desires belongs to my Lord and not me. I can only express my presence with the sword of Dmitry, so I cannot accept His Majesty’s offer.”</p>
<p>Chris. He valued aspiration and the desire for strength. Whatever Valhalla offered, he didn’t think it would make him stronger than when he was with Roman.</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry was an existence that made his subordinates feel special. The benefits and treatment received by his subordinates under Dmitry made them have faith in Roman.</p>
<p>Chris’s answer was right. While politely refusing, the Valhalla Emperor turned to Roman Dmitry at the answer, which made him shine.</p>
<p>It was interesting. Seeing Roman Dmitry look like he was expecting Chris’s answer, the Emperor felt a strange sense of kinship.</p>
<p>“I cannot help it if you put it that way. The Eve Stage ends with this. And to Chris, who is the winner, I will give him as much wealth that he cannot use up all his life!”</p>
<p>The Emperor cried out the reward for the winner.</p>
<p>At his cry, which contained all emotions, the people of Valhalla shook off their tension and let out enthusiastic cheers.</p>
<p>This nation. This was Valhalla.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The eve of the festival was over. At the time when everyone went back to their respective rooms for tomorrow’s festival….</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>Viscount Jonathan’s head jerked back. Marquis Belfir coughed up his anger with a red face.</p>
<p>“This fucking bastard. You definitely made it clear that other than Rankers, there is no doubt about Gonzales’s victory. Then what are these results? A stranger from another nation won the championship. And after boasting that you would deal with the subordinates of Roman in front of everyone, we now end up as idiots who spouted nonsense to the Emperor.”</p>
<p>“I-I apologize… <em>Kuak!</em>”</p>
<p><em>Slap.</em></p>
<p>“Shut up!”</p>
<p>And he was hit again.</p>
<p>During the last meeting, the conversation proceeded in a more leveled manner than now, but the situation changed with their failure.</p>
<p>The Emperor of Valhalla. He was a man who valued performance. And Marquis Belfir, who led this plan, knew he couldn’t avoid taking responsibility for it.</p>
<p>“Look at how those conservative ones loved Chris the moment he won. If we repeat the same failure as today, His Majesty will side with the conservatives and not us. This is something I refuse to accept. Valhalla’s future cannot be satisfied by repeating its barbaric history in the jungles.”</p>
<p>The current Valhalla was on the borderline. Was it moving to a new future? Or would they talk about tradition and stop where they are?</p>
<p>Recently, the Marquis had been building a cooperative relationship with the Kronos Empire, but the Valhalla Emperor could change his mind at any time.</p>
<p>And that was why he had to bring results now to prove his advice was right. If another defeat happened again, then the Emperor would rethink everything.</p>
<p>Valhalla was unique in many ways. Even though the Emperor held absolute power, the specific future of the nation he thought about didn’t exist.</p>
<p>The violence continued. When the Marquis, who had been slapping him, was catching his breath, Viscount Jonathan corrected his form.</p>
<p>As he was on his knees, he spoke in a desperate manner,</p>
<p>“Marquis. Please give me one more chance. I will set the stage for Roman to lose.”</p>
<p>It was his last chance. The moment he let go of this, he couldn’t survive in Valhalla any longer. And Valhalla wasn’t a place for those who were used to failure.</p>
<p>“No, you don’t have to do anything.”</p>
<p>His voice was cold.</p>
<p>Marquis Belfir wiped the blood from his hand with a cloth and recalled the report he had received.</p>
<p>“Barbossa has moved in earnest, so you’d better hope he succeeds. If even Barbossa fails, in order for you to take responsibility, I will guarantee that you will not survive.”</p>
<p>It was the day before the festival, and there was still a chance to turn the tables.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Right after returning home, Roman Dmitry took a break. Knowing that he usually enjoyed tea, the servants served him something simple to eat and drink. But one of the servants serving the refreshments said,</p>
<p>“Do not eat anything.”</p>
<p>At that moment, Roman looked at his servant. The servant said that when the other servants went to get other things.</p>
<p>“Barbossa has made his move. I don’t know what tricks he played, but from now on, you need to be careful of what you eat and drink. Keep that in mind. Barbossa’s opponents were helplessly defeated by him, but the tricks he did were hidden. Do not shout out, saying he tried to assassinate you, either. Tomorrow is the festival day. Even if there is poison, Barbossa will try to turn you into a coward who is avoiding the fight in the end because of the fear that you would lose to him.”</p>
<p>He looked around and checked that the servants hadn’t returned yet, and he added,</p>
<p>“I am someone who admires Mr. Morales. We are the ‘Force of One,’ and I hope people like you will not be brought down by that coward and his tricks. We will not expect you to trust us. But if you are careful about everything in Valhalla, you can at least deal with Barbossa in a fair manner.”</p>
<p>It was an honest voice that had nothing to do with vendettas. Following the tradition of Valhalla, he heard what kind of person Roman Dmitry was from Sanchez.</p>
<p>Regardless of nationality, he was someone worthy of respect. What would happen if a figure like Roman Dmitry collapsed due to his cowardly tricks?</p>
<p>The fact that he, who was a member of Valhalla, had allowed it to happen couldn’t be accepted.</p>
<p>So as the people who shared the same values moved, they found out that Barbossa was making his move.</p>
<p>His role was over. At least he had given Roman Dmitry the chance to have a fair fight.</p>
<p>At the sight of the other servants entering the room, the servant changed his expression and tried to leave.</p>
<p>At that moment….</p>
<p>The servant’s expression was stained with shock.</p>
<p>“…!?”</p>
<p>Roman Dmitry.</p>
<p>As if to show off to everyone, he was drinking the tea.</p>
<p>...</p>
