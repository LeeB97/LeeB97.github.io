<p><strong>Chapter 182. The Full Account</strong></p>
<p>‘Huuuk.’</p>
<p>The moment he opened his eyes, his breath paused in his throat.</p>
<p>He wanted to exhale instinctively, but his mouth refused to open. The air wiggling around in his throat searched for another exit and left through his nostrils before exploding.</p>
<p>Ssp— ssssp—</p>
<p>When he repeated breathing in and out through his nose, his chest finally relaxed. Only then did the spinning world enter his sight.</p>
<p>He wanted to shake his head from dizziness, but he gave up immediately feeling a head-splitting headache.</p>
<p>With a headache of this magnitude, he felt like he would likely be shaking his brain if he shook his head.</p>
<p>In the end, Seol Jihu closed his eyes that he worked so hard to open, as the world spinning in a circle was inducing even more dizziness and nausea.</p>
<p>Only when the pain in his head disappeared and the churning in his stomach subsided, did he have the courage to open his eyes again.</p>
<p>With the world no longer spinning, he saw an unfamiliar ceiling. His eyes started to focus, but it was hard to say that his vision was normal.</p>
<p>Should he call it hazy?</p>
<p>The ceiling was undulating gently, like he was looking up at the world from under the water.</p>
<p>‘What… happened…?’</p>
<p>He wanted to look around the room, but his head refused to budge an inch. When he began to roll his eyes without any other choice, he caught sight of a familiar person.</p>
<p>It was Seo Yuhui.</p>
<p>‘Noona…?’</p>
<p>Seol Jihu slowly closed his eyes, then opened them back up.</p>
<p>‘Did I… survive…?’</p>
<p>His memory after activating Future Vision was hazy, but he thought he would die based on what he felt at the time.</p>
<p>He still didn’t know exactly what happened.</p>
<p>But feeling relieved that Seo Yuhui was in his sight, he called her. No, he tried to call her.</p>
<p>‘….’</p>
