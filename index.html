<p>“Your transport will take a total of two hours. We don’t have the conditions. Even if we fly, it will take three hours. If we include the time taken in between, it might take seven or eight hours, or even more.” The middle-aged man in the middle frowned slightly, he said, “It’s impossible not to be affected for such a long time.”</p>
<p>“Being affected is still affected. The key is still the outcome of the treatment. We will save the patient. This is the most important thing, right?” Huo Congjun spoke from another angle.</p>
<p>The few of them nodded slowly.</p>
<p>“Also, the doctors on our side won’t be in danger, right?” Huo Congjun looked over and spoke as calmly as possible, he said, “I myself am a military doctor, and I have participated in some missions. My suggestion is that if you need doctors from the front lines, it’s best to send military doctors who are trained, experienced, and mentally prepared. Otherwise, if our doctors go over directly, not only will they be in danger, but they might also cause the patient to be in danger. In the end, it will have the opposite effect, and it’s not good for both sides.”</p>
<p>“I won’t.” The middle-aged man glanced at Huo congjun and said, “Your Doctor Ling Ran’s face is useless on the battlefield.”</p>
<p>“That’s for the best.” Huo congjun paused for a moment and said, “If it’s useful, don’t send it up.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” The middle-aged man agreed.</p>
<p>“This is a national treasure-level doctor. I’m serious.” Huo Congjun’s expression became serious again, he said solemnly, “Ling ran is extremely hardworking and disciplined. He works hard and studies hard. You can see that he saves a few people every day and gives hope to several families. What you can’t see is that he grows day and night. He urges himself to learn new skills and techniques almost every day at a speed that ordinary people can’t reach. “And he’s only in his twenties now. By the time he retires and closes the surgery, how many people can he save? “Even if Ling ran is willing, I mean, even if Ling ran cries and wants to go up there, please protect him well.”</p>
<p>“I understand. Don’t worry.” The middle-aged men looked at each other and nodded.</p>
<p>“Let me say one more thing.” Huo Congjun was not at ease, he said again, “Wait until thirty to forty years later, when everyone’s bodies are weak and their organs begin to function abnormally, you will be very glad that there is a doctor in the world, Ling ran, who can treat your illness. “Even if it’s just this one hope, it will make the world a better and safer place. “I’m not cursing. Birth, old age, illness, and death are the objective laws of human beings, but Doctor Ling is definitely the person you would like to see the most during the process of birth, old age, illness, and death.”</p>
<p>“Understood.” The middle-aged men nodded again with determination.</p>
<p>Ling ran also took off his surgical gown and walked in.</p>
<p>“The surgery went smoothly. You can start to arrange for your luck to change.” Ling ran had always been simple and direct when he spoke.</p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work.” Huo congjun immediately changed his expression and smiled at Ling ran, he said, “The few of you are waiting for you. When you reach the place, you must also pay attention to your own safety. If you have any problems, you can look for the person in charge…”</p>
<p>“I have a problem with this.” Ling ran found an empty seat and sat down. It was obvious that he was ready to talk.</p>
<p>In his experience, if he chose to talk, most people would not refuse.</p>
<p>The few middle-aged men were not ordinary people, but they still turned around at the same time and found their own seats.</p>
<p>“If you have any problems, don’t worry.” The oldest middle-aged man in charge showed a human-like expression.</p>
<p>“Who is the person in charge of medical transportation?” Ling ran asked.</p>
<p>The oldest middle-aged man chuckled and said, “If it’s me, I should be the person in charge. You Can Call Me Department director Chen.”</p>
<p>Ling ran did not reply. He continued to ask, “Do you know anything about medicine? What about medical transportation?”</p>
<p>Huo Congjun had been listening attentively. At this moment, he had already somewhat guessed the direction in which Ling ran was speaking, he immediately said, “Ling ran, department director Chen is the final person-in-charge. He doesn’t need to understand medicine. He only needs to make some business judgments, such as military judgments and administrative and personnel decisions. This is something that requires him to look at the overall situation…”</p>
<p>“Then, what about the person-in-charge of medical judgments?” Ling ran pressed again.</p>
<p>“This… It’s mainly you…” department director Chen answered with a smile.</p>
<p>Ling ran then said, “Do I have the authority to adjust the medical transport plan and the specific details of the transport plan?”</p>
<p>“This… What do you want to change?” Department director Chen frowned slightly. Compared to before, the current Ling ran was a little too domineering.</p>
<p>There was nothing wrong with his idea. Ling ran had just obtained the medical transport (perfect level) skill, and there were many plans and details to choose from in his mind, how could he be satisfied with just being an ordinary high-end emergency doctor.</p>
<p>In fact, there were not many doctors in China who were good at medical transportation. It was even rarer for them to have superb surgical skills.</p>
<p>In this regard, there was a huge gap between China and foreign countries. After all, the rich and the second-generation rich in China had only just learned how to court death. There were very few people who went to Kenya in the summer to play with lions, went to the slums of India in the winter to have fun, and broke their legs on Mount Everest, there were also a few who suffered from diarrhea in the Amazon jungle. Even the military did not have the experience to transport heavily injured people from Afghanistan to Germany in batches.</p>
<p>In addition, the demand for ordinary people to seek medical treatment abroad was still very low. The terms of the insurance companies were not so bad that they would send people to India for surgery..</p>
<p>Ling ran did not have any thoughts about medical transportation in the past, but after he obtained the perfect level of medical transportation skills, his thoughts changed completely.</p>
<p>“First of all, you have to give me enough information. I need it now.” Ling ran looked at department director Chen, then, he said, “Second, you have to evaluate the patient. The mechanism of the injury, the location of the injury, and the Glasgow Coma score all have a great impact on the success of transport. “Third, you have to reorganize the communication between transport. How My Team and your team exchange information, especially the information regarding medical operations, must be smooth and accurate. “Accuracy is very important…”</p>
<p>Chief Chen felt his body heat up when he heard that. “If you ask for it, you’ll be performing a major surgery on our transportation mission.”</p>
<p>“This is a necessary plan to improve the survival rate of patients,” Ling ran said.</p>
<p>“As long as you’re willing to do it, I have no objections.” Chief Chen suddenly chuckled and said, “You’re just adding to your burden, but it looks like you’re taking responsibility.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1421: should be passed on</p>
<p>“Our initial task was to send a few criminals who were involved in the case back to the hospitals in the mainland. “They all had external injuries of varying degrees. They received emergency treatment and around a week of treatment, but the effects were not ideal. Two of them were still in a coma…”</p>
<p>The young man whom Department director Chen invited was tall, handsome, and confident. However, he was not as good-looking as Ling ran. When he spoke, his gaze unconsciously drifted towards Ling ran, he said in a serious tone, “These few criminals involved in the case are very important. They have received better treatment in the local area. There must be no mistakes during the transportation process.”</p>
<p>“HMM, to ensure this, you must have a basic understanding of the transportation process.” Ling ran never listened to others’tone. He only explained the facts and said, “Can you provide the information of the few patients now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, you can take it back and study it…” the young man took out a briefcase.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian immediately went forward and took it. He opened it and roughly read the cover. Then, he handed the image part to Ling ran.</p>
<p>“Wait a moment.” Ling ran did not take it back and study it as the other party had expected. Instead, he read it on the spot.</p>
<p>The tall and handsome young man could only stand in front of Ling ran and wait. He did not have anything else to do. He just opened his eyes and stared at Ling ran. The more he looked at Ling ran, the more guilty he felt.</p>
<p>“Is it possible that being handsome can charm death? Why did you choose someone so young?” The young man complained to his companion in a low voice, unwilling to do so.</p>
<p>His companion raised his head and looked at the tall and handsome young man. “Hehe.”</p>
<p>“The meaning of the early stage is that there will be other patients after you who will be transferred to the mainland through medical transport, right?” Ling ran asked again after he finished looking at the four videos.</p>
<p>The young man hesitated for a moment and said, “Our mission can not be revealed to you. You Don’t have to worry about the follow-up situation for now.”</p>
<p>“From the situation of these four patients, if they were sent to Yun Hua Hospital immediately after they were injured, they would not have been unconscious until now.” Ling ran glanced at the other party calmly, he said, “So, if there are still patients in the future, the best plan is to transport them immediately after they are injured.”</p>
<p>The young man said unwillingly, “We also have quite excellent doctors at the front line.”</p>
<p>“This is the difference between the anglo-american model and the Franco-german model.” Ling ran had never given in to the other party in terms of professionalism. He did not give the other party any face at all, he said, “There are pros and cons between the two, but that refers to the city’s first aid system. In a more dangerous disaster location, or at the front line of a war, the anglo-american model has a clear advantage.”</p>
<p>“Say something that people can understand,” the young man said in a cowardly manner.</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou, who came over to take a look while he was away, would usually not make people feel too awkward, therefore, he said, “The anglo-american model refers to the model of bringing patients to the hospital quickly. Although first aid is also done on the spot, it is mainly based on the most basic and urgent needs. “The Franco-german model can be understood as bringing doctors to the rescue site, or even bringing the hospital to the patients. Those who can not complete medical treatment on the spot will be sent to the hospital</p>
<p>“Then we want the French-german Model! You can arrange your medical transport equipment according to the needs and complete the treatment on the spot as soon as possible…”</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou interrupted the young man’s words and said faintly, “Princess Diana died under the French-german model.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“After Princess Diana got into a car accident, she immediately received a high level of medical resources. But unfortunately, under the French-german model of the first aid system, even if the best first aid doctors were sent to carry out on-the-spot treatment, they were unable to save Princess Diana.” “From the analysis reports that followed, if the doctors at that time did not carry out on-site treatment for a longer period of time and instead adopted the anglo-american model, bringing Princess Diana back to the hospital with simple first aid, her survival rate would greatly increase.” Doctor Zhou’s reply was gentle and simple, he added, “Princess Diana’s first aid this time has also caused a lot of reflection on the Franco-german model in the medical world. The professional doctors and professional organizations in the country usually do not choose the Franco-german model.”</p>
<p>The young man was a little embarrassed, but he still insisted, “We can combine them. When we send doctors to treat the patients on the spot, we can transfer them back as soon as possible…”</p>
<p>“What are the standards of on-the-spot treatment? are destructive treatments allowed? For example, if the stomach is bleeding and needs to be treated by a laparotomy, should we open it up?” Doctor Zhou curled his lips, he said, “No matter how good your resources are, the hospitals that you can transport to the scene can only be small-scale. A light-scale hospital and a high-level hospital at the rear are two different concepts. “The experience of the United States and Afghanistan is to transport the rear as quickly as possible. They only need to do basic treatment, and the trained medical soldiers can do it well. “They have already saved the soldiers who have lost all their limbs, suffered abdominal injuries, spinal injuries, chest injuries, and head injuries.”</p>
<p>The young man opened his mouth. “What is the meaning of saving lives like this… ?”</p>
<p>“Finding the meaning of life is the responsibility of a philosopher. Doctors are only responsible for saving lives.” Doctor Zhou paused for a moment before he gave his position to Ling ran. He then added, “You have to let us do our job well.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” The young man silently took a step back.</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou looked at Ling ran and said, “Doctor Ling, please continue.”</p>
<p>“We will use the anglo-american model. In terms of distance and mission, we have to establish an air rescue channel. “First, we have to determine a destination hospital. We have to prepare and train for the ground rescue. “Second, we need a medical emergency helicopter. We need medical emergency equipment such as ECG monitoring, ventilators, defibrillators, and other medical emergency equipment on board. We need trained medical emergency personnel. “The space of the helicopters must be big enough to transport at least two lying wounded people at the same time. If it’s not big enough, we need bigger helicopters, or even more helicopters. If the destination can not be reached by helicopters…”</p>
<p>“The helicopters can arrive.” The young man sighed and said, “We can also guarantee the helicopters of two lying wounded people.”</p>
<p>“Then, the second step would be the transfer of the fixed-wing aircraft. The fixed-wing aircraft would be arranged within the range of the helicopter. The closer the helicopter is, the better. This is because the helicopter’s speed is still not fast enough.” Ling ran paused for a moment, he thought for a moment, he said, “The transfer of the fixed-wing aircraft to the airport of the destination would also require the transfer of the second helicopter to go directly to the hospital of the destination. “Assuming that the location of the incident is within 1,000 kilometers, the transport can be completed in at least two hours, but the best plan is to complete it within one hour. “One hour of gold.”</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou coughed twice, he explained, “One hour of gold refers to the first hour of trauma. It is the key to first aid or treatment. “The Franco-german model is partly based on this. “However, the anglo-american model proves that it is a better choice to reduce the transit time to one hour.”</p>
<p>“That means two helicopters and one fixed-wing aircraft. I’ll report to the higher-ups.” The young man concluded.</p>
<p>Ling ran shook his head. “There’s another hospital. “If possible, build a hospital within one hour. It’s best to do the initial treatment. “At the same time, although the training for all the participants only requires a simple training, it also needs to be done in addition.”</p>
<p>“Understood.” The young man no longer nagged. He only raised his head to look at Ling ran and said, “This request of yours is much more intensive than the other doctors. If it doesn’t work…”</p>
<p>“Go and pass on my request.” Ling ran did not have any intention of arguing. To him, the most important thing was to pass on the request and fulfill the task. As for the thoughts of the Middleman, it did not matter whether he was happy, unhappy, angry, or licking the dog.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1422: was too expensive</p>
<p>“Two helicopters and one plane. In fact, we need three to four helicopters to meet the basic needs. “Then, we need a field hospital. The equipment in the hospital needs a CT machine, an MRI machine, and an intensive care unit. “If we want to further transport them to the rear, we need to add more helicopters and planes… This is the long-term plan written by Doctor Ling ran. Every page of it is like burning money.”</p>
<p>The tall and handsome young man stood under the projector in the conference room. He could not help but grit his teeth as he spoke.</p>
<p>He wanted too much.</p>
<p>There was no need to mention the few representatives in the conference room. They could not help but start a small meeting.</p>
<p>As they looked at the numbers in the feasibility report, chief Chen’s head was also buzzing. “I mean, there are a lot of resources, but Ling ran’s requirements are too high. He did not even think about how much the cost of these helicopters and planes alone would cost. How much would the expensive equipment in his hospital cost? “Let’s not talk about this anymore. If the medical team assigned to each helicopter, the medical team assigned to the planes, and the hospital had to be on standby 24 hours a day, how many people would that require? “If it’s a field hospital and a field airfield, how many people would I have to prepare to be his assistant?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, our field hospital can’t be like other countries. Some things can not be bought even if we want to…”</p>
<p>“How do we arrange the security forces? According to what standards? What about the electricity? The power consumption of the field hospitals and field airfields is not low. We can’t even use the ones we used before.”</p>
<p>“Field hospitals can be placed in the Army Group’s base, and they can share the power of the security guards. For the time being, field airfields are not too big of a problem… However, the fixed-wing aircraft and the medical team attached to the helicopter that he wants can’t be saved at all. Not only do we have to have people on duty, but we also have to do additional training. Moreover, I once again communicated with them and learned that even with their model, it would definitely be beneficial to move the surgeons forward.” Even though the tall and handsome young man was unhappy with Ling ran’s handsomeness and oppression, he still had to follow Ling Ran’s explanation when it came to work, however, when it came to work, he still had to follow Ling Ran’s explanation.</p>
<p>Department director Chen nodded slowly. “Such an expensive plane. If you want to get on it, you’ll definitely have to go to a professional doctor, but… it’s too expensive.”</p>
<p>A representative participating in the conference chimed in and said, “Based on the overall assessment, LING RAN’s requirements are the highest. The amount of investment in the initial stage has already far exceeded the requirements of the few candidates behind him. In comparison, the latter few proposals are more practical. Not only is the cost lower, but the management and control are also easier. The cost-benefit ratio is very high…”</p>
<p>“I still want Ling ran.” Department director Chen opened his eyes wide, as if the complaints he had just made did not come from his own mouth.</p>
<p>“The cost is indeed a problem.”</p>
<p>“Then I Want Ling ran too.” There was determination and persistence in department director Chen’s eyes. He looked very much like an otaku who wanted an alien but did not have enough budget, an otaku who wanted an apple but did not have enough budget, and an otaku who wanted to parachute but did not have enough budget..</p>
<p>“It’s too expensive. It might not be easy for the higher-ups to pass,” the young man said in a low voice.</p>
<p>There was a moment of silence in the conference room.</p>
<p>“Compared to Ling Ran’s plan…” department director Chen Sighed. “Ling Ran’s plan can send people to the hospital at the back in one or two hours. Even if Ling ran does not need to perform surgery, he can send a doctor who is about the same level. There is an eighty percent chance that he will be able to bring people back. “The other people… the other people’s skills are not necessarily better than Ling ran’s. The advantage of the plan, what we want this time, is the cost-effectiveness ratio?”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>
<p>“That makes sense.”</p>
<p>“They say that the resources are skewed. It’s not easy to come up with a good plan, but they say that they don’t have the resources…”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” department director Chen agreed. “If it’s a one-time investment, it definitely won’t work, but Ling Ran’s plan is obviously a plan that can be used for a long time. SIGH… it’s just expensive.”</p>
<p>“It’s all a long-term investment. As long as it’s used, it won’t work even if it’s not used for a long time.” The young man complained in a low voice.</p>
<p>Department director Chen Chuckled. “If we look at it in the long term, it’s not completely unacceptable if we average the budget.”</p>
<p>“Is it really acceptable?” The young man was quite surprised. He was actually thinking about a secondary solution, but he did not expect department director Chen’s attitude to be so different. He even supported it quite firmly.</p>
<p>“Let’s take a look at this first. Didn’t Ling ran fly over? Let’s see what the result is.” Director Chen stopped for a moment, his voice became softer, he said, “This is really a life-saving plan. You Don’t have to compare it with foreign countries, and you don’t have to compare it with the other troops. Just compare it with ourselves. Are you willing to use a cost-effective plan, or do you want the best plan?”</p>
<p>Chief Chen’s opinion was expressed very clearly. Everyone present was surprised, but they still nodded.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Ling ran took Lu Wenbin, Ma Yanlin, and the other members of Ling Treatment Group on a transport plane and flew all the way to the border.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin was wrapped in a seatbelt, but he still did not forget to squat. It was as if he was in a thirty thousand feet gym. Ma yanlin tore at the dried fish bit by bit, swallowing all his nervousness.</p>
<p>Yu Yuan walked out from the gap between the seatbelts. She swaggered past them, but no one caught her.</p>
<p>When her legs felt comfortable, Yu Yuan crawled back in and hung up her seatbelt again. Her feet stepped on the Louis Vuitton collection box that she had tied up. She opened an album nervously and expectantly, the album was filled with descriptions of the species of animals near the border. She had already put away her cell phone, so she could not look at it even if she wanted to.</p>
<p>The calmest person in the phone was Ling ran. His eyes were half-closed, and he was reviewing the information about medical transportation in his mind.</p>
<p>He did not have enough information at the moment, but Ling ran did not force the other party to provide much information. On one hand, he already had a lot of skills in his arsenal, and he was already able to counter every move he made. On the other hand, Ling ran was more inclined to carry out medical transshipment under normal circumstances.</p>
<p>The reason he came out personally this time was not entirely because department director Chen and the others requested it. Ling ran also needed to personally participate in and observe the current situation of medical transshipment in the country.</p>
<p>Compared to his foreign counterparts, such as the medical transshipment in the United States on the front lines of the war, the medical transshipment in Germany along the highways, the medical transshipment in Switzerland during the ski season, and the ceiling of the medical transshipment in the country was the military. No matter how Yun Hua Hospital changed next, it was still necessary to observe the military’s approach.</p>
<p>“We’re almost there. Doctor Ling, we’re ready to get off the plane.” A man in uniform walked over and shouted loudly beside Ling ran’s ear.</p>
<p>“I’m not getting off the plane.” Ling ran shook his head and said, “Tell them to send the patients to the plane as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>The uniformed man frowned and reminded him, “There are quite a few leaders down there.”</p>
<p>A hint of seriousness flashed in Ling Ran’s eyes. “Did they affect our luck?”</p>
<p>The uniformed man thought for three seconds with a straight face. He finally understood Ling ran’s words. His entire face was filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>“Doctor Ling is really waiting for your answer.” Zuo Cidian Sighed quietly and woke up from his turtle’s breath.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1423: quickly returned</p>
<p>The uniform with a straight face looked at Zuo cidian seriously. He then looked at the doctors in the cabin, but none of them had any intention of going down. Instead, they were busy in the cabin. They finally came to their senses, and their faces tensed up even more, he said a little seriously, “The leaders are here to support us in our work… Doctor Ling, since you’re here, why don’t You Come Down and meet the leaders? There’s no harm in that, right?”</p>
<p>“It will affect the speed of the transportation, and then the quality of the medical treatment. We have to return as soon as possible,” Ling ran finished his sentence, he turned his head and said to zuo cidian, “This contact person is too long-winded. Go and inform the Doctor in charge of the transportation below. Hurry up and send him to the plane.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zuo Cidian looked at the man in uniform sympathetically, he knew that the medical transport was the most important task for the team under Department director Chen’s command in the near future. Because they spent too much money, the contact person whom Ling ran despised for being too long-winded was obviously not qualified to contact him in the future. Zuo Cidian himself was already prepared to add fuel to the fire and even question department director Chen.</p>
<p>“Come with me.” Zuo Cidian pulled the man out of the plane to avoid causing trouble in front of Ling ran.</p>
<p>The uniformed man fell into a daze again. He was dragged off the plane by Zuo Cidian.</p>
<p>When they arrived at the bottom of the plane, the uniformed man finally understood what was going on under the gazes of a group of people. He said angrily, “What… What is this?”</p>
<p>“Do you have a system?” Zuo Cidian grabbed the uniformed man’s arm and gently comforted him.</p>
<p>The uniformed man was stunned by the question again. ‘are all of you non-linear?’</p>
<p>“Is there a system?” Zuo Cidian repeated.</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“That’s good.” Zuo cidian also heaved a sigh of relief, he smiled and said, “If you have a system, you don’t have to worry about being fired. Later on, you’ll have other work arrangements and just do it. On our side, you shouldn’t have to worry about the follow-up work.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was worried that the other party would get angry and cause trouble. Now that he was sure that the other party still had a system, he felt at ease instead.</p>
<p>The Man in the uniform felt uncomfortable. “What are you talking about? I just said a few words…”</p>
<p>“You’re not a clinical medicine major, are you?” Zuo Cidian guessed that he definitely did not understand emergency medicine.</p>
<p>The Man in the uniform was stunned and said in a low voice, “Although I’m not a clinical medicine major, what I did…”</p>
<p>“Do you have a medical background? What exactly is it?”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“Then you’re not wrong.” Zuo cidian smiled and said, “We do things in a race against time here. The time you waste might also be the patient’s life. Let’s get the stretcher… Well, you go ahead and do your thing. We’re about to take off.” “As for the leader… I’ll go and greet him.”</p>
<p>As they spoke, an inflatable stretcher passed by the two of them.</p>
<p>One of the patients had a tube inserted into his arm. His eyes were tightly shut as he was carried onto the transport plane.</p>
<p>Ling ran’s command could be heard from the front. “Remember, the electric stretcher lifting system is still necessary.”</p>
<p>Then, he heard an unknown young doctor agree.</p>
<p>“Let’s go. Let’s greet your leader.” Zuo cidian hurried to do his work. He wanted to return to Ling ran’s side as soon as possible. Even if he was a medical student, he was still a great rival for Ling ran’s favor. With Ling ran’s current ability, it would be easy for him to arrange a team.</p>
<p>Most of the people on the transport plane were busy.</p>
<p>The ground crew below the transport plane was frantically refueling, charging, and performing all sorts of checks. The doctors in the transport plane were also waving the sockets of various small appliances, and they were using every opportunity to attack the patients.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin and the others had actually learned about medical transshipment before. They would occasionally need to use emergency vehicles when they needed to perform freelance surgeries. In comparison, although air transshipment had some other characteristics, it was actually much more useful than emergency vehicles.</p>
<p>There was only so much space in the emergency vehicles. When air transshipment was performed, the cabin could accommodate more and better medical equipment. It was actually more convenient for the doctors to operate it. This was also the reason why the survival rate was higher even though the air transshipment took a long time, compared to the ambulance’s simple and crude life-support system, a medical transport plane that was good enough could last for a much longer time.</p>
<p>The military doctors below also knew this truth. After they brought the patient up, they were obviously relieved. Of course, there was also a sense of relief when the responsibility was transferred.</p>
<p>“Wait a minute.” Ling ran did not immediately let the patient go. He beckoned to the two people who had just come up and said, “Put a label on the patient’s body. The label will indicate your operation.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” The two uniformed doctors frowned.</p>
<p>Yu Yuan wandered around. When she saw that Zuo Cidian was not around, she jumped onto the chair and said, “Just treat it as writing a simple case. It’s just written on a label, and it will be stuck on the patient’s body or stretcher.”</p>
<p>“Is… is this necessary?” The uniformed doctor hesitated.</p>
<p>“Of course it’s necessary. The patient was sent thousands of miles away. How would the doctors over there know about the situation here? How would they know the patient’s medical history and treatment history? Would it be a waste of precious treatment time to re-examine the patient?” Yu Yuan did not say anything else, they talked about theories one after another.</p>
<p>The two doctors in uniform were stunned for a moment. Then, they whispered, “The system has a medical history. You’ll know it once you check it online.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to release the system to the public?” Yu Yuan said sternly, “When patients are sent to the rear, they may not be sent to the hospital to be handled by the Doctor. Are you going to put the system on the public Internet for everyone to check?”</p>
<p>“Also, how are we going to check it when we’re on the plane?”</p>
<p>“I. . . Okay, I’ll write it.” The two uniformed doctors did not like what Yu Yuan said, and they were not willing to bear the responsibility. So, they laid on their stomach and started to write the labels.</p>
<p>“You can write it a little simpler, but you have to write it clearly.” Yu Yuan reminded them again, “You also have to carefully note the cases in the system, and you have to complete it in a short time. It’s best if it’s within a few minutes.”</p>
<p>“It’ll take you a few hours to fly back, right? Why are you so pressed for time?”</p>
<p>“What if you die in the front line?” Yu Yuan’s expression became serious. “Or if you’re seriously injured and unconscious, who will write the medical records for the patients in the plane?”</p>
<p>The two uniformed doctors were stunned for a moment before they said in unison, “Bad Luck!”</p>
<p>“After our Doctor Ling’s medical transport system is established, you might be able to use it,” Yu Yuan comforted them.</p>
<p>All the doctors present felt that it made sense. All of them, including the uniformed doctors, nodded in resignation.</p>
<p>“Prepare to take off.” Another uniformed man walked over and shouted loudly.</p>
<p>“You can take off now.” Ling ran had been examining the patient, but he only made minor adjustments.</p>
<p>“Do you need us to follow you?” The Doctor in uniform was not very happy to ask. This was the request of their superior.</p>
<p>Ling ran shook his head gently and said, “You must be responsible for the entire medical transportation process in stages. You can just take care of your own part.”</p>
<p>“Alright.” The two uniformed doctors did not waste any time. After they received the answer, they quickly got off the plane.</p>
<p>Ling ran checked the patient’s condition again. He thought for a moment and said, “Record it again. The surgical treatment in the frontline hospital must be simple and direct. Only necessary surgeries must be carried out.”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Zuo Cidian, who turned around, answered loudly. He came to Ling ran’s side and asked, “Is the treatment here not good?”</p>
<p>“It’s handled very well, but there’s no need for it. The surgery needs to be carried out as far as possible.” Ling ran paused for a moment, he then said, “The preparation here is sufficient, but that doesn’t mean that the front-line hospital has always been fully prepared. Only carrying out the necessary surgery can alleviate the medical stress to the greatest extent, and it’s also beneficial to the patient.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1424: Serious</p>
<p>The transport plane changed to a helicopter and was sent to the ward. Ling ran looked up at his watch again and said, “Four hours and 37 minutes. It’s too slow.”</p>
<p>The doctors who were preparing for the surgery and were about to high-five each other looked at each other and sensed that something serious was going on.</p>
<p>“The time limit is so strict?” Ma yanlin mumbled softly, “The surgery requirements will also follow, right?”</p>
<p>Yu Yuan chuckled as she moved a stepping stool. She was not qualified to go on stage today. She only wanted to stand a little higher so that she could see the surgery on the spot, therefore, she said in a relaxed mood, “Will doctor Ling’s requirements be more relaxed if we transport the patient back from a thousand miles away?”</p>
<p>As soon as she finished speaking, Huo Congjun was the first to walk in.</p>
<p>“You, Doctor Ling, don’t like to talk, but you have to be proactive. The patient that was transported back from a thousand miles away, so many people, and so much energy and time spent to buy time, if anyone wastes it for me, I will send him to Bazhaizi village. Do you understand?” Huo Congjun did not even have the slightest bit of politeness in his tone, the pressure in his eyes became even more intense.</p>
<p>“Understood.” Almost subconsciously, everyone answered obediently at the first moment.</p>
<p>Only then did Huo Congjun nod and stand aside. He did not interfere with the specific work of Ling treatment group.</p>
<p>At this moment, Ling ran was only doing his usual first aid work. Although this work had started on the plane, when he arrived at the hospital, his needs and goals were naturally different.</p>
<p>“Mews (Early Warning Rating Scale-RRB- score is tIt. it’s still relatively stabDepartmentment direcTao tao also came to the scene and took the initiative to reportLingling ran.</p>
<p>This scene was a little abrupt, but it also looked very natural.</p>
<p>As a chief physician, department director Tao’s authority in the emergency department was not strong. Especially after the countdown for retirement sounded, department director Tao appeared even more buddhist-like.</p>
<p>However, at the same time, chief physician Tao was also the oldest and most experienced doctor in the emergency department. He was a buddhist-like doctor, and his freedom and ease in doing things also came with it. Other than being chief physician Huo’s assistant, chief physician Tao did not need to lower himself to be an assistant, especially when he was an assistant in the emergency department. It was even more unnecessary. He could either start his own group or rest on the spot, and no one would say anything about it.</p>
<p>However, the scene today was like a rehearsal. Department director Tao joined in as if he was receiving an emergency patient as usual. However, it felt a little strange for him to voluntarily report this to Ling ran.</p>
<p>“Let the orthopedics department join in.” Ling ran gave the order according to the planned plan. Everyone could not help but heave a sigh of relief.</p>
<p>Before the transfer plane arrived, everyone understood the patient’s condition. They also held a consultation and discussed it, and they also invited doctors from other departments. However, after the patient arrived and was examined, the patient’s condition was very likely to change. In other words, it was bound to change. The crux of the problem was what kind of changes would be needed for the change, and whether the contents of the previous consultation needed to be changed drastically.</p>
<p>If it did not need to be changed drastically, then from a medical point of view, it was already a very smooth start.</p>
<p>Immediately after that, Ling ran put on his surgical gown and performed a laparotomy on the patient.</p>
<p>Patients had performed X-ray, CT, or magnetic resonance imaging examinations many times before, but for surgeons, these were not as accurate and complete as the information that could be obtained through an laparotomy. Most importantly, several patients had undergone surgery, and the few patients who were transferred out were not performing well. Not only were they not performing well, but there were even some serious complications after the surgery.</p>
<p>This was not surprising. When the hospital performed surgery, they would often have to go to the palace twice and go to the palace thrice. Some complicated surgeries would require multiple surgeries at the beginning. However, similar to going to the palace twice and going to the palace thrice, many serious complications after the surgery were very difficult to cure, and the probability of death was also very high.</p>
<p>“There is fluid in the abdominal cavity, and the infection is not completely controlled. The reduction of the bone joints is still fine, but the intestinal tract… well, basically, the intestinal obstruction… department director Tao, are you here to perform the surgery?” Ling ran had examined the first patient, he did not perform the surgery himself.</p>
<p>Intestinal surgery was not his specialty. More importantly, his mission was not just this patient. He just needed to give priority to the diagnosis of the patient’s symptoms based on the judgment made on the plane.</p>
<p>After leaving the patient with intestinal obstruction to the group led by department director Tao, Ling ran began to arrange for another patient with a head injury. After a brief examination, he said, “Hand him over to the neurology department.”</p>
<p>The Neurology Department’s doctors had been waiting outside for a long time. They happily came in to take over.</p>
<p>Even though they were not sure that they could cure patient number two, it was not easy to die in the internal medicine department. Most importantly, the sense of participation was very strong.</p>
<p>The patients who were transferred to the hospital were given a wide range of medication and treatment. Not to mention the opportunity and honor behind it, this type of treatment was also what doctors liked the most.</p>
<p>After leaving the third patient who suffered multiple injuries to the general surgery department, Ling ran dealt with the fourth patient on his own.</p>
<p>At this time, a voice came from outside the viewing room. “Doctor Ling, this patient must wake up.”</p>
<p>Ling ran lowered his head and looked at the patient before him, but he did not answer.</p>
<p>From his point of view, the patient’s condition was not very complicated, but he might not necessarily be able to accomplish the task of waking up.</p>
<p>There were all kinds of people coming and going outside the viewing room. Some were there to watch the surgery, some were there to watch the show, and some were there to watch the people.</p>
<p>What was different from the past was that there were a lot of doctors from the surgery department today.</p>
<p>Huo congjun chuckled as he exited the room. He squatted in a corner and watched the doctors from other departments come and go.</p>
<p>He knew very well what these people were thinking.</p>
<p>In the past, the people who came to watch Ling ran’s surgery were really all kinds of people. Some of the medical staff from the outer hospital did not have any serious business at all. They were not even surgeons, but they would come to see Ling ran. Huo Congjun had to reorganize himself a few times, only then did the visiting room resume its normal work. In terms of numbers, the number of medical staff from the outer hospital was often greater than that of the hospital itself. This was also a very interesting topic within Yun Hua Hospital.</p>
<p>However, today, the doctors from the surgical department of the hospital occupied the majority of the seats. They occupied the seats, and the number of people from the outer hospital who could come in later decreased. According to the rules of the visiting room set up by Huo Congjun, they could watch for a longer period of time, which resulted in a huge change in the proportion of visitors.</p>
<p>As for the reason, it was just that all the people in the world came for benefits.</p>
<p>In the past, no matter how Big Ling ran’s reputation was, so what if his flying knives became armed patrols? The doctors from other departments did not need to pay too much attention to this point. As long as they were not jealous, at most, the doctors from small departments would be worried, the ordinary doctors from small departments could not be bothered to worry.</p>
<p>However, medical transportation was too attractive.</p>
<p>It was to pull patients from other departments to the hospital. Moreover, it was not just to pull patients from other departments. Most of the time, they were patients from multiple departments.</p>
<p>In the past, how could a department of internal medicine like the Department of Neurology expect to receive such an important resource from Ling ran.</p>
<p>Yet, such a thing really happened.</p>
<p>“The power of this thing is much greater than expected,” Huo Congjun muttered to himself.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1425: did not move at all</p>
<p>“The situation has stabilized. Once the anesthetic wears off, we should be able to wake up slowly.” Ling ran stood outside the ICU and explained the situation to department director Chen and the others.</p>
<p>After he finished speaking, the ICU director immediately stepped forward in a positive manner and said, “Our current life support system is extremely powerful. The technical level of our department has long reached the first-class level in the country…”</p>
<p>There were many people gathered in front of him. Although some of them were impatient, they all listened to the ICU director’s bragging leisurely.</p>
<p>The patient’s condition was really good. This was the most important thing. With this foundation, everyone was basically happy. It was just like in the stock market, where there was no short selling, during the period when the stock index was rising.., the mood of the shareholders would be very good. They could view the world and humanity in a peaceful and optimistic manner. When they encountered the mistakes or even mistakes of others, they could easily be forgiven.</p>
<p>The emergency department now had its own EICU. However, for the sake of greater security, the transferred patients were still sent to the ICU after the surgery.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun agreed with this. This was not only because the patients’symptoms were very serious and the EICU’s strength was still insufficient. It was also because of the responsibility. So many doctors from different departments had actively participated in the treatment of the transferred patients, everyone’s goal was obviously not to give a speech at the death symposium.</p>
<p>No matter from which angle, Huo Congjun or the emergency department had the obligation to protect everyone’s work. At least, it was to divert a portion of the responsibility and pressure.</p>
<p>The ICU did a good job. They did not hesitate to send out their strongest force. Per capita, one director served the patients. It could be seen that all the numbers were trending in a good direction.</p>
<p>Obviously, the colleagues in the ICU also saw the advantage and strength of medical transportation. Therefore, even if the emergency department built their own EICU to make people uncomfortable, the department directors of the ICU had to endure it.</p>
<p>If they could not bear it, they would mess up the big plan. If they were at a disadvantage, they would be at a disadvantage. Men had gold under their knees… the ancient words were like pearls and pearls, fully demonstrating the benefits of lowering their heads.</p>
<p>Department director Chen and the others also clearly relaxed, he said half-jokingly, “Doctor Ling’s plan is really good, but it’s really expensive. Now that we’ve completed an important battle, can we save some ammunition and rest for a while?”</p>
<p>Ling ran did not really understand him. He naturally looked at Zuo Cidian.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian’s expression was serious as he asked, “What chief Chen means is that you want to reduce expenses and reduce costs? The medical transportation we’re doing now is actually not expensive…”</p>
<p>“Not to the extent of reducing the cost…” director Chen smiled awkwardly and quickly expressed that he did not want to burn the bridge after crossing it, he quickly said, “Even if we can save some places, the basic framework will definitely not change, and we can’t change it either, right?”</p>
<p>“We can package a part of the mission and transfer it to the local area.” Ling ran’s answer was somewhat unexpected.</p>
<p>Department director Chen was stunned. “You can also pack this up?”</p>
<p>“Of course,” Ling ran said very naturally. “We can increase the helicopter’s capacity and increase the social helicopter rescue. This way, we can even out the cost of fixed-wing aircraft. Or we can directly subcontract the fixed-wing aircraft and reduce the cost by optimizing the helicopter’s capacity. We can also appropriately reduce the number of doctors who will be sent to the front line and replace them with rescue personnel who have received preliminary training. “Similarly, we can reduce the number of doctors who will be sent to the front line because our model is to send as many doctors to the front line as possible. Therefore, we don’t need the front line hospital to have too much heavy equipment. For example, high-standard operating theaters are not necessary…”</p>
<p>Chief Chen smacked his lips and laughed awkwardly as he listened. He had been in big brother for so long that he was already used to eating alone. He was not willing to tear apart the medical transportation system that he had just built.</p>
<p>“As for helicopters… If this is used at the front line, it definitely can’t be socialized.” Department director Chen shook his head slightly.</p>
<p>“If we add some socialized helicopters and use them in safer areas, we can also share the costs.” Zuo Cidian had learned from Ling ran for a period of time. In addition, he was very sensitive to costs and other related information, he had already asked Ling ran about it a long time ago. As he spoke, he took out the template in his mind.</p>
<p>Department director Chen still shook his head. “This will increase the cost of management, right? Besides, the places we often go to are poor and remote. Even if we buy a helicopter, no one will use it.”</p>
<p>“We can use it at the end. For example, in Yun Hua, we can increase the capacity of the helicopter. The pilots can communicate with each other, the parts and maintenance can be done, and the ground service can also be communicated with each other. Moreover, the helicopters in Yun Hua can also make money…” zuo cidian sincerely gave his suggestion.</p>
<p>“It’s too messy. No, no, no.” Director Chen shook his head. “Moreover, we need to use military helicopters at the front line, so we can’t communicate with the rear.</p>
<p>“Fixed-wing aircraft is the most expensive part. If we reduce this part… there is still a certain amount of space…” Zuo Cidian thought as he deliberated his words.</p>
<p>Director Chen said, “Fixed-wing aircraft… the aircraft and pilots are already in place. There is no need to change it anymore.”</p>
<p>“Then, should we introduce state-owned enterprises?”</p>
<p>“No. We have policies in this area.”</p>
<p>“Field Hospital…”</p>
<p>“No…”</p>
<p>“Medical care…”</p>
<p>“No!”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian finally understood as he spoke. He asked a few more questions and said softly, “That means we have to save money, but it’s best if we don’t touch anything at all?”</p>
<p>Director Chen’s face turned slightly red, as if he had only drunk eight taels of wine.</p>
<p>The middle-aged man behind him coughed lightly and said, “It means to reduce costs and increase efficiency.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian acted as if he had suddenly realized something and changed the topic. “Speaking of which, when the patient wakes up, our mission will basically be completed…”</p>
<p>“That’s right, that’s right. Thank you, thank you.” Director Chen shook everyone’s hands tightly and thanked them. “This mission is all thanks to everyone. Wait for the news, everyone, wait for the news…”</p>
<p>“Wait for the news.” Everyone was exceptionally happy. A sense of honor was always easy to develop in a crowd.</p>
<p>At the same time, a few pharmaceutical representatives who were at the scene also spread the story of the medical transportation. Such a project with heavy assets was naturally not welcomed by capital. It was not that it did not make money, but many people were too lazy to make such money. The pharmaceutical representatives did not think that their company could do such a job. They all treated it as a joke.</p>
<p>The news circulated in the circle and soon spread out.</p>
<p>Compared to the anecdotes of the company, this kind of story involving a large sum of money but also seemed to have practical applications was always easy to spread in a secretive way.</p>
<p>Some people only spread it, and more people just looked at it. But in some places, there were always some people who would pay attention to it.</p>
<p>On the weekend.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian took out a day with great difficulty to go shopping with his girlfriend who had just confirmed their relationship.</p>
<p>His phone rang without any surprise.</p>
<p>Zuo cidian glanced at the screen and put on the mute.</p>
<p>The phone rang again, but it was still the same configuration.</p>
<p>When it rang for the third time, Zuo Cidian could only shake his head. “Looks like I have to answer it.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.” His girlfriend who had just confirmed their relationship was the head nurse’s best friend. She had known about Zuo Cidian’s working style long ago, so her expression was still rather calm.</p>
<p>“Director Bo, why are you calling me?” Zuo Cidian picked up director Bo’s call from Jun ‘an clinic and said first, “Doctor Ling has been very busy with freelance surgeries recently, but he doesn’t have time to fly.”</p>
<p>“He’s not arranging freelance surgeries. He’s looking for you.” Director Bo’s voice was steady.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian could not help but be surprised. “Why are you looking for me?”</p>
<p>“I have a few investors here who want to know about the situation of the medical treatment. Is this a good time to look for you?” Director Bo laughed twice and said, “There’s a consultation fee.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1426: Understanding</p>
<p>“There’s no need to pay. Ask me if there’s anything,” zuo cidian said politely and nodded to his girlfriend next to him.</p>
<p>His girlfriend, who was dressed in Amash, smiled amiably and fed Zuo cidian a cherry while she looked around, indicating that she wouldn’t disturb him.</p>
<p>Of course, the older girl’s ears were perked up. She was still very concerned about Zuo Cidian’s financial situation.</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, director bo chuckled and said, “It seems that you don’t like our small amount of money. However, you really have to help me with this.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian did not respond. He said, “If we’re just chatting, I’m fine. Let’s find a time to sit together…”</p>
<p>“These people who do investment and finance are definitely not just chatting.” Director Bo paused for a moment and said, “This is something that is beneficial to everyone. It’s also beneficial to Doctor Ling.”</p>
<p>“Oh? How So?” Zuo Cidian’s interest was slightly piqued.</p>
<p>Ever since he was given a piece of Green Water Ghost, Zuo Cidian’s interest in money had actually greatly decreased. In other words, his understanding of money had greatly changed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Zuo Cidian’s pursuit of his “Career” was increasing. And his career naturally depended on Ling ran.</p>
<p>Director Bo also updated his understanding of Zuo Cidian once again. He clicked his tongue secretly, he said again, “If you use the financial circle, the planes, helicopters, and medical equipment needed for medical transshipment are all valuable assets. No matter how big the medical service organization is, it’s impossible for it to abandon the people in the financial circle and do such a business on its own. “However, Doctor Ling should need medical transportation services. His skills are so strong that it’s impossible for him to live in a corner.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian seemed to agree with him, but he did not show it on the surface. He only said, “Doctor Ling has been quite interested in medical transportation recently, but the previous projects have already been completed.”</p>
<p>“Let me put it this way. Why do you think the cities with the strongest medical treatment in China are always Beijing and Shanghai? “Why can the medical centers in the United States be in Cleveland and Germany can be in Hamburg?” Director Bo had prepared a whole set of explanations, at this moment, his tone was slightly brighter and sharper.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian had never thought of such a question before. He was stunned for a moment and said, “The medical center in Japan is still in Tokyo.”</p>
<p>“Yes, but the reason is the same.” Director Bo smiled slightly, he said, “It is precisely because China and Japan are relatively weak in terms of medical transportation and do not have much good development. Therefore, our way of medical transportation is to allow patients to move and naturally move to the capital and developed cities. “As for countries like the United States and Germany, their medical transportation is very developed. Therefore, patients can go from big cities to small cities, and the hospital has reduced many unnecessary costs.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian thought for a moment, then smiled and said, “This topic of yours is a little too big.”</p>
<p>“What I mean is that if we don’t do medical transportation in our country, doctors like Doctor Ling will inevitably go to Beijing or Shanghai in the end. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to achieve the highest achievement,” director Bo said very seriously, then, he hit the nail on the head and said, “It’s not as convenient for Doctor Ling to go to Beijing as it is for Yun Hua.”</p>
<p>It was not just inconvenient. Zuo Cidian instantly thought of countless unfavorable conditions. Those medical students who graduated from doctorates, beautiful girls, boys who knew how to speak and know how to use their skills, middle-aged people who had accumulated countless life experiences… the pressure of being in Beijing was overwhelming, no matter how you thought about it, there were always men who were more miserable than you and worked harder than you..</p>
<p>Moreover, the situation in the hospitals in the capital city was very complicated. The emergency department was not necessarily better than the emergency center in Yun Hua Hospital.</p>
<p>As a city with a population of 20 million, the only opponent of the emergency center in Yun Hua Hospital was the provincial hospital and half of the Lu Hospital. In comparison, how many emergency departments were there in a tertiary grade a hospital in the capital city</p>
<p>Even if the radiation field in the capital city was wider, the source of their illness was too scattered compared to Yun Hua Hospital. It was not… not completely impossible for Ling ran to squeeze other departments like this, but the difficulty was probably even higher.</p>
<p>“Are the friends you introduced preparing to change their medical fortunes?” Zuo Cidian asked in a low voice.</p>
<p>“It’s hard to say whether they will do it or not, but they definitely have the intention to do so. Otherwise, they would not have come to me and come to you.” Director bo smiled and said, “How is it? Do you want to meet them?”</p>
<p>“The amount involved is not small.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. However, some of them do financial leasing. As long as the project itself can be established, tens of billions will not be a problem.” Director Bo revealed some information and bragged a little.</p>
<p>Zuo cidian replied with an “Oh” and temporarily believed him.</p>
<p>The hospital had a lot of dealings with financial leasing, and airplanes were the traditional field of financial leasing. The mode of operation is usually for the demand side to put forward certain needs, such as I need an airplane, or so-and-so medical equipment, after the financial company buys it, lease it to the other side at the agreed price.</p>
<p>This way, the main thing is to reduce the financial pressure of the users, and facilitate rapid expansion. For example, almost all the airlines have succumbed to financial leasing, and the newly purchased airplanes are almost all from financial institutions.</p>
<p>Hospitals were also using financial leasing more and more frequently. Now, an MRI could cost 20 million to 30 million, and CT machines could go from row 32 to row 64 to row 128. The performance price had increased like computer accessories. Even if the cash flow of a normal hospital was super strong, if they really had to save up tens of millions to buy equipment, they would have all kinds of headaches. In addition to the depreciation and obsolescence costs of the equipment, they might as well directly use leasing. Especially for high-end tertiary grade A hospitals. They could use the best equipment through financial leasing. In an era of rapid technological change, the cost of obsolescence of the old equipment would not be painful.</p>
<p>If medical transshipment was carried out, the thirst for funds would be obvious without asking.</p>
<p>However, unlike airlines that operated flights, medical transshipment could be simple or complicated. The complicated ones could be set up in various cities, and the simple ones could be followed by the phone.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian’s expression did not change even after he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>“Are You Alright?” His girlfriend stuffed another cherry into Zuo Cidian’s mouth. It was so sweet.</p>
<p>Zuo cidian hummed twice, he said, “It’s nothing. These private companies are really flexible. They have noticed all the stories from the corners. Sigh, I’m sorry. I have too much work here. It’s impossible for me to completely let go of my hands.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I understand.” His girlfriend made a kind gesture and said, “However, I just heard about finance. You also know about finance.”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know. I just know what they want to do.” Zuo Cidian’s forehead flashed with experience. “In the area of medical transportation, it’s not something that anyone can do just because they want to. They have to have the technology, money, and policy support. We just finished the project here, and someone came looking for us. It’s not simple.”</p>
<p>“It sounds complicated…”</p>
<p>“Nothing complicated.” Zuo cidian patted his chest proudly. “Men are not afraid of things being difficult, but they are afraid of nothing to do.”</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1427: was not at a disadvantage</p>
<p>“Chief Wang.”</p>
<p>“Doctor Liu…”</p>
<p>“Nurse Luo, long time no see.”</p>
<p>Director Bo came to Yun Hua Hospital’s emergency medical center and greeted them along the way. He was so familiar with them that he felt like he was in his own backyard.</p>
<p>In reality, he came to Yun Hua Hospital pitifully few times. However, just like when he went to other hospitals, every time he went to a hospital, director Bo would do his best to show his strongest sense of presence and brush his face the most, the doctors, nurses, and administrators who knew him the most would make use of each other for the rest of his work.</p>
<p>Director Bo was a good-looking person, and he was dressed like a successful middle-aged man. It was very easy for him to gain a good impression from the crowd. As he brushed past them, he soon met Zuo Cidian.</p>
<p>Compared to the well-dressed director Bo, Zuo Cidian looked a little dispirited. The white coat on his body was a little dirty. It was unknown whether the corner of his coat was stained with blood, urine, or feces, but it showed some black and yellow color. His face was full of fatigue, as if he had not slept for the whole night and was undergoing surgery, his old and rough skin had become even older and rougher, looking worse than many professional old patients.</p>
<p>“Doctor Zuo, it’s been a while. Have you gone artistic?” Director Bo tried to hold back his laughter as he greeted him. He felt that it was much easier to communicate with him in person than over the phone.</p>
<p>“I work hard, so I can’t be artistic.” Zuo cidian laughed bitterly. He looked at director Bo and said, “I thought you would be here in a few days. Why are you in such a hurry?”</p>
<p>“When it comes to finance, the concept of time is different,” director Bo ridiculed. He asked, “Is it convenient for us to go out for a meal?”</p>
<p>“We don’t have time.” Zuo cidian spread his hands and said, “The emergency department is very busy today. We really can’t go out.”</p>
<p>“Then let’s talk in the emergency room.” Director Bo seemed to have made the final decision.</p>
<p>“Is it really that urgent?” Although Zuo Cidian looked tired, his IQ instantly went up.</p>
<p>Director Bo laughed bitterly. “You don’t care about money. We, the lackeys of capitalists, are not allowed to serve capital. When capital has a requirement, a dog will run away and break its legs.”</p>
<p>He was taller, more handsome, younger, and earned more than himself. He was freer than himself and had a better family than himself. He might even be younger than himself, but Dean Bo claimed to be a lackey, this greatly increased Zuo Cidian’s mood. He could not help but smile. “Even capitalists need to talk about human rights. Alright, Go and call for help. I’ll eat something along the way.”</p>
<p>Director Bo Chuckled. In a short while, he had brought three people over.</p>
<p>The person in the lead was an elite man in his forties or fifties. He was handsome and followed by an ordinary greasy middle-aged man. He was a beautiful american-style woman with light blonde hair.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was instantly taken aback. He stared at the american-style woman for a few seconds before he retracted his gaze and looked at director Bo. He said in a low and cautious voice, “Don’t even think about using a honey trap…”</p>
<p>Director Bo Smiled. “I don’t know about you. Doctor Zuo is famous for being professional. I Won’t Give You…”</p>
<p>“Not even Doctor Ling!” Zuo Cidian was serious.</p>
<p>“I won’t.” Director Bo was also serious. “It’s just a joke. Miss Hannah has worked for Standard Chartered Bank for many years. She is a very famous investor and an important partner in this project. Don’t offend her.”</p>
<p>“That’s impressive.” Zuo Cidian could not tell the other party’s age. He felt that she was not too young, but he could not tell.</p>
<p>Director Bo did not waste time. He introduced the two parties in a few sentences, then, he said, “Doctor Zuo, the two of you mainly want to know about the current situation of the medical transportation in the country. If you can tell us what you know, we can discuss whether there is a possibility of cooperation…”</p>
<p>“I actually don’t know much…” Zuo Cidian finally realized that among the three of them, the ordinary greasy middle-aged man was the translator, and the other two were the capitalists who were qualified to be lackeys.</p>
<p>“We heard that the policy that Doctor Ling is implementing is the anglo-american Model?” Hannah smiled and asked in English, which was then translated by common oil.</p>
<p>This was something that could be said. Zuo cidian nodded and asked in return, “Do you care about this?”</p>
<p>“Of course. It’s too expensive to send the doctor forward with the Franco-german model.” The leading elite smiled and said, “In our opinion, the plan adopted by Doctor Ling is more in line with the market.”</p>
<p>“Do you know the plan adopted by Doctor Ling?” Zuo cidian frowned.</p>
<p>“Part of it.” Hannah paused for a moment and then began to ask about the details.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was extremely cautious. He said a few words that he could, but he did not say anything that he could not. Even so, after a few minutes, he could not help but glare at director Bo and said, “That’s enough, right?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you just start talking?” Director Bo smiled awkwardly.</p>
<p>“I was blinded by the lard. Let’s not talk about it anymore. What’s the point of talking about this!” Zuo Cidian shook his head and was about to leave.</p>
<p>“We can put a special medical plane in Yun Hua to see the situation.” Hannah pulled Zuo Cidian back with just one sentence.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“The special plane will be equipped with a special medical team and pilots. When there is a mission, they will go to the designated location to pick up the designated people or things. In theory, there will be patients from all over the world who will be transferred to Yun Hua Hospital through the system…” Hannah flicked her light golden hair, she said, “If it works, Your Yun Hua Hospital will become very lively.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian’s heart moved. “What are your benefits?”</p>
<p>“We can temporarily not consider this problem.” Hannah’s smile was very wide. She said, “If Yun Hua’s flight route can operate smoothly, we will talk about cooperation.”</p>
<p>“You still want to inspect us?” Zuo Cidian smiled.</p>
<p>“Of course.” Hannah’s answer was very direct. She asked again, “Can I talk to Doctor Ling?”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian did not answer immediately. Beside him, director bo coughed and said, “Old Zuo, you remember that we are in Thailand, right?”</p>
<p>“HM? What’s Wrong?” Zuo cidian glanced at his wrist. He did not bring the green water ghost with him, so his courage increased greatly.</p>
<p>“At that time, weren’t there patients who were transferred from abroad?” Director Bo reminded, then, he said, “Not only did they treat patients and save them, but they also gained fame. Not only domestically, but internationally.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian had some thoughts, but he was also a little hesitant.</p>
<p>“They are willing to leave a plane here. What do you have to worry about?” Director Bo said helplessly.</p>
<p>“Is it free?”</p>
<p>“The cost is the cost, but there are special medical planes. There are only three or four cities in China now,” director Bo emphasized again, “Unless Doctor Ling doesn’t want to develop internationally, this is definitely a shortcut.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll talk to Doctor Ling,” Zuo Cidian replied and turned to leave. He turned around and went to look for Huo Congjun.</p>
<p>Even though Zuo Cidian knew director Huo very well, he would never let go of a plane that he had “Given away” for free. However, director Huo was famous for never losing out.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1428: was not professional</p>
<p>“Let’s wait here for a while. Doctor Ling will be out soon.” Zuo Cidian had a humble smile on his face. One-eighth of it was for the capitalists, and seven-eighth was for department director Huo.</p>
<p>Hannah, who was wearing a Prada suit, frowned slightly. She looked at the doctors and patients around her and said slowly, “I thought I could sit in the conference room today and discuss in detail some of the issues that everyone is concerned about.”</p>
<p>Everyone present could hear the underlying meaning of her words. She brought out a plane, and it was not easy to serve her?</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian gave a smile of agreement, but he said, “Doctor Ling’s personality is not quite the same. Moreover, time is indeed very tight. Please bear with me.”</p>
<p>Huo Congjun also had a smile on his face. He said, “Today’s surgery is full. If it were not for the requests of the few of you, Doctor Ling would not have come out to meet everyone.”</p>
<p>Huo Congjun was also willing to restrain his temper when it came to capitalists who were willing to pay, especially when the other party didn’t pay up.</p>
<p>Hannah and the others were also helpless. Things had already progressed to this stage, so they shouldn’t be throwing tantrums.</p>
<p>The few of them waited for a long time in boredom before they heard the greetings of “Doctor Ling” and “Doctor Ling” coming from the front. Then, they simultaneously gave a gaze salute.</p>
<p>There was even a hint of provocation in Hannah’s eyes. As an investor for many years, she knew very well how to deal with these self-righteous investors. She also knew how to let them understand the power of capital.</p>
<p>The other colleagues who came with Hannah had even more unbridled looks in their eyes. They even had the thought of watching a good show.</p>
<p>Ling ran walked over with a mask on. When he saw Huo Congjun and the others, he took off his mask out of politeness and threw it into the corresponding trash can. Then, he walked over and looked at Zuo Cidian, Hannah, and the others, he said, “I have about twenty minutes.”</p>
<p>“Thank you for your hard work.” Hannah suddenly let out a long breath. She was like a small fish that had been suffocated by water. A young deer in heat broke its leg, and the widow at the village entrance was in a mess, her voice was hoarse as she spoke in Chinese, which she was not very familiar with. “You… are… Doctor Ling?”</p>
<p>“I am.” Ling ran nodded.</p>
<p>Hannah gulped. “I… I didn’t…”</p>
<p>“You can use English.” Ling ran had also seen many girls like international students. When they spoke to him in Chinese, it was not only difficult for them to express themselves, but it was also easy for them to make mistakes. Whenever this happened, Ling ran would allow the other party to use English so that he could speed up and reject them.</p>
<p>Ling ran was quite familiar with some related languages.</p>
<p>Hannah could not help but let out a sigh of relief and put on the most beautiful smile, she spoke in English, “I Saw Your ID photo. I didn’t expect, didn’t expect… that your aura in real life is so different. “Of course, your ID photo is also very handsome, but it gives a different feeling to a real person. “I originally thought that you would be a man like an ordinary celebrity, but it’s obvious that your appearance is the same as your inner self. You’re very… very… uh… Extraordinary!”</p>
<p>Ling ran gave a smile that met the expectations of society.</p>
<p>Ling ran was familiar with Hannah’s performance and even the content of her words. Not only that, he even had a mature coping system. For example, don’t be in a hurry to reject her immediately. Otherwise, the other party would always feel that she had not finished her words. She might even think that Ling ran would agree if she said ‘XXX’or performed a little better..</p>
<p>This was like using more direct and violent methods to save time during the surgery. It was easy to prolong the surgery time, and the prognosis was not good.</p>
<p>Ling ran stood there and quietly waited for Hannah to speak so that she could fully explain herself.</p>
<p>However, Hannah was not a teenage or twenty-something-year-old girl after all. She only said a few words before she remembered her work for the day.</p>
<p>Even though her work was no longer that important, Hannah still steeled herself and adjusted her mindset. She asked Ling ran, “Doctor Ling, do you have any questions about the medical plane we provided?”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ling ran nodded and said, “We don’t have enough equipment, and the time spent on duty is too short. In addition, the medical team provided on the plane needs to further learn and train, or be replaced.”</p>
<p>“These requirements of yours…” Hannah forced a smile and considered her words carefully, she said, “Your requirements are reasonable, but based on cost considerations, we can add some equipment. However, if we update the equipment, the changes to the plane will be larger, and the maintenance time will be very long. “In addition, the aircraft’s duty time is linked to the pilot’s duty time, the flight team’s duty time, and the medical team’s duty time. At least in the initial stage, we think that increasing the aircraft’s duty time is too high and almost unacceptable..</p>
<p>“I can give you a list of equipment. If you can update the equipment according to one type of equipment on the list, the other equipment can be postponed. The flight’s duty time can be adjusted later. What about the medical team?”</p>
<p>“This…” Hannah hesitated.</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor, who was standing at the back, he said, “Doctor Ling, the aircraft is managed by a separate company. We hope that we can still maintain relative independence. Of course, we will provide them with further training and learning in the next period of time…”</p>
<p>“How do we train and Learn?” Ling ran paid more attention to this question, and he was obviously more professional.</p>
<p>“This…” the middle-aged investor was initially just giving him a runaround, but he was suddenly a little unhappy when he was asked this question. He waited for a few seconds, he said, “Just like what I said just now, Doctor Ling, the management of a medical plane is a separate company. The medical team on the plane will also maintain relative independence and professionalism. We will arrange for their training and learning together.”</p>
<p>Ling ran looked into the other party’s eyes and said, “They are not professional enough…”</p>
<p>“You say that…” the middle-aged investor chuckled, he said, “We also have a professional company that is responsible for this aspect of management. We can’t just replace the entire team just because of your words, right? This cost is not low either.”</p>
<p>“Then, you can directly ask the members of the team to listen to their own opinions. You can ask them if they are professional enough and if they are able to undertake the corresponding transportation tasks.” Ling ran paused for a moment, then, he said, “You can tell them that my specialties are heart surgery, liver surgery, finger replantation, Achilles tendon rupture repair, knee arthroscopy, shoulder arthroscopy, and so on. If the patients board the medical plane, can they maintain the patient’s life and condition to be stable?”</p>
<p>The purpose of medical transportation was to treat patients. Since the medical plane that stopped in Yun Hua wanted to transport patients to Ling ran, it was naturally to transport patients with the diseases that he was good at.</p>
<p>Even if the investors present did not know what to do, they still felt a little guilty when they heard the words ‘heart surgery’, ‘Liver Surgery’, and so on.</p>
<p>“But, but… if we change the medical team…” the middle-aged investor frowned. After a while, he really picked up his phone and said, “I’ll make a few calls.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1429: was too much</p>
<p>“Ling ran thinks that our team’s professional abilities are insufficient?” Ye Mingzhi, the person-in-charge of the medical team, clearly raised his voice over the phone.</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor was not afraid of stirring up trouble. He said, “I also think that it’s too much to say this in front of so many people. “But what Ling ran meant was that he said that his specialty is heart surgery, liver surgery, and finger amputation. He thinks that if you don’t do training and further study, you won’t be able to change your medical fate.”</p>
<p>“This is too much!” Ye Mingzhi’s voice started to get angry.</p>
<p>“Right? He’s slapping all of us in the face. From what Ling ran said, he even wants to replace your team with another team. That’s why I vehemently oppose it.”</p>
<p>“How can you do this!” Ye Mingzhi’s voice went through the phone, and his voice became even louder.</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor continued to stir up trouble with a smile on his face, he said, “The few of us don’t really like Ling ran’s style. He’s too arrogant and domineering. However, you guys are experts in medical treatment. If you have any ideas, just tell me directly. I’ll relay them to everyone.”</p>
<p>“Everyone?”</p>
<p>“The few of us investors and the person-in-charge of the organization are all in Yun Hua Hospital. We’re talking to Ling ran and the others.”</p>
<p>“HMM… I don’t want to offend anyone either.”</p>
<p>“What are you afraid of offending?” The middle-aged investor smiled disdainfully. Then, he changed into a normal smile and adjusted the posture of the phone, he said, “If you have any ideas, just say it. I’ll relay them to them. Ling ran is going to replace all of you. What are you afraid of?”</p>
<p>“This… this is too much.” Ye Ming’s voice started to tremble.</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor nodded. “You’re right.”</p>
<p>“That’s too much!”</p>
<p>“I know. Doctor Ye, you have to tell me what you really think. If not, I won’t be able to speak up for you,” the middle-aged investor said patiently.</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi responded twice before he said slowly, “Then, I’ll have to trouble you to ask, Ling ran… How Does Doctor Ling plan to train and further our studies…”</p>
<p>“Alright… HMM?” The middle-aged investor’s entire body was about to twist. “Do you want me to ask this?”</p>
<p>“If it’s heart surgery and liver surgery… well, we do indeed lack experience in dealing with them, especially the liver surgery department. Doctor Ling is indeed quite famous in this field. If he thinks that we’re not professional, then there must be a reason…” ye Ming knew that his words had become smoother at this moment.</p>
<p>To be more precise, after the initial bit of anger, Ye Ming knew that he was still more worried and afraid.</p>
<p>He wasn’t a surgical genius himself. He had only worked in a normal tertiary grade a hospital for a period of time, and then by coincidence, he changed jobs to that company. He started to do the air transportation, but he spent most of his time on standby, the frequency of air transportation was very low. Even so, Ye Ming knew that he was a little out of his league. He was even more aware of his own shortcomings.</p>
<p>If it was in any other industry, ye Ming knew that he wouldn’t have been so anxious and worried. However, in the medical industry, especially in the area of the air transportation, he and his team were facing a real life-and-death battle. If a patient lived, the patient and his family might not necessarily thank them. However, if a patient died, there was a 70-80% chance that someone would ask why.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew very well that he had not met with any problems until now. It was not because he had good skills or talent. It was not even because he was lucky. It was because their work frequency was low and they had relatively ample resources. However, once they started to connect with public hospitals and large hospitals, the situation would change rapidly.</p>
<p>The patients that they had transported in the past were actually mostly rich people who were in stable conditions. For example, if they were not satisfied with the medical treatment in a certain place, they would think of ways to transport them to Beijing or even abroad. Even so, ye mingzhi often asked the doctors of the affiliated hospitals to accompany him. In the process, he also saw the gap between himself and the senior doctors of other hospitals.</p>
<p>This was a gap that was difficult to bridge in a short time. If his skills were good enough and his abilities were strong enough, how could he give up the establishment of the public hospitals to work in private companies. Even if the salary offered by the company was considerable, the income of doctors in public hospitals was not low at his age. If he looked forward to the future and prospects, public hospitals were even better and stronger.</p>
<p>Therefore, in order to avoid any accidents, ye Ming knew that he would not take it head-on.</p>
<p>He was in the emergency department. He had heard of Ling ran’s reputation a long time ago. He had even seen Ling ran during the broadcast of the conference, and he knew how often Ling ran performed surgeries. Even if he was replaced by Ling ran.., ye Ming knew that he did not want to be involved in a lawsuit.</p>
<p>Especially in this situation where he was already accused of being unprofessional, ye Ming knew that his mind was already filled with alarms.</p>
<p>Families who could afford to pay for medical treatment were definitely not good people. Ye Ming knew that he did not want to take a huge risk to earn this slightly higher than normal salary.</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor on the phone asked a few more questions. When he received the same answer, he was dumbfounded. He asked in a daze, “Are you willing to be kicked out?”</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi opened his mouth as he spoke, he said, “Are you kidding me? Yun Hua Hospital’s emergency medical center is one of the top five emergency medical centers in the country. The head of Yun Hua Hospital’s Emergency Medical Center said that I’m not good at my job and told me to get lost. What can I Do? “Besides, didn’t they say that? “I can train and further my studies? “I’m willing to train and further my studies. Everyone in my team is willing.”</p>
<p>“We… aren’t we considering the issue of face?”</p>
<p>Ye Ming was amused. “Compared to such a big shot, what face do I have? If my master went to Yun Hua Hospital’s emergency department to further his studies, he would be scolded until his face was covered in blood. He would probably be able to brag to us for three years when he comes back.”</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor on the other end of the call was at a loss for words. He blurted out, “You did learn something from your master.”</p>
<p>With that, he hung up the phone.</p>
<p>Ye Ming, who was on the other end of the call, was stunned for a few seconds before he shook his head. He turned around and hugged the pharmaceutical sales representative beneath him as he continued to recuperate.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>The middle-aged investor washed his face, calmed down for a moment, and returned to the room next door.</p>
<p>The few people who came with him looked at him.</p>
<p>“The medical team can reluctantly agree to further education or training, but we’ll have to bear this part of the expenses and time costs together.”</p>
<p>A few people, including Hannah, looked at the middle-aged investor in surprise, but they did not say anything. They believed that the “Colleague” who just called had the right to make a decision.</p>
<p>Ling ran asked, “What are the costs?”</p>
<p>“The salary during the period of study, the expenses of hiring additional personnel, various travel expenses, and hotel expenses…” the middle-aged investor knew everything. He had built the company step by step in the past.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun did not wait for Ling ran to answer. He said, “We don’t bear the cost.”</p>
<p>“We don’t bear the cost? Why? That won’t do!”</p>
<p>Huo congjun spread his hands and pointed at Ling ran. He then said, “We don’t bear the cost.”</p>
<p>The few investors only frowned and did not say anything else.</p>
<p>“We can try it out.” Dean Bo helped smooth out the word.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1430: was not needed</p>
<p>A Falcon 2000 gently glided to the end of the runway.</p>
<p>A few stretchers were quickly carried down, and then they boarded two Jinhui general purpose helicopters.</p>
<p>The medical transport company that Hannah and the others invested in only bought fixed-wing aircraft, but for the helicopter transport, they re-contracted it to minimize the risk of assets.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that he did not feel anything about this in the past. The employees did what the boss wanted them to do. In his opinion, it seemed to be the most correct model.</p>
<p>However, after that professional conversation, Ye Ming knew that when he looked at the helicopter marked “Jinhui general utility” again, he could not help but feel a little guilty.</p>
<p>It was not that they could not use the helicopter that was not his own, but the frequency and workload of the same medical transshipment mission would definitely be lower if they used the outsourcing model. If he contacted Ling ran, he would be able to use the helicopter, this was also evidence that it was not professional enough.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that he followed the patient into the second helicopter. He frowned as he headed to Yun Hua Hospital.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that he was about to meet Ling ran, and he could not help but feel a little emotional and worried.</p>
<p>Meeting a big shot had always been a matter of chance and danger coexisting together. What if Ling ran did not like it? What if Ling ran was unhappy? What if Ling ran wanted to destroy him? What if he was killed by the Society?</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi’s expression changed as he thought about it. The assistant next to him thought that he was suffering from Yang deficiency. When he was about to land, he whispered into ye Mingzhi’s ear, “Captain Ye, who’s going to report?”</p>
<p>They still followed the pre-hospital emergency mode. When they arrived at the hospital, they had to explain to the local doctors about the patient’s condition and the measures they had taken. Normally, Ye Ming was the one who came to report, but he had been lazy too many times, so everyone was used to making preparations.</p>
<p>“Let me do it.” Ye Ming knew that he didn’t dare to give up his authority this time. The other doctors didn’t know the specific situation. If he were to screw over the team, it would be too tragic.</p>
<p>Even if he was going to screw over the team, he should be the one to screw over the team.</p>
<p>Ye Ming thought to himself and sat up straight, as if he was preparing for an interview.</p>
<p>The patient who was lying on the stretcher saw that the doctors on both sides were getting nervous. He couldn’t help but get nervous as well. “Isn’t it just a transfer? Did Something Happen?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. Don’t worry. We’re discussing the procedure.” The vice-captain quickly comforted the patient.</p>
<p>Most of the patients that they had transferred recently were wealthy patients like these. They were not like the urgent cases on television where they had to race against time. In most cases, the purpose of transferring patients was to transfer them to another hospital for treatment or to perform surgery in another hospital. Simply put, they were patients who had money and requirements.</p>
<p>Today was no exception. A few patients needed hepatectomy. The doctors of the local hospital had discussed with the patients who originally wanted to perform freelance surgeries. The cost of the freelance surgery was changed to the cost of transferring patients to another hospital, so they directly cut the queue and sent them over.</p>
<p>Of course, the condition of the patients was slightly different, especially the two old men on the helicopter. Their bodies were all plugged with tubes, so they were still quite different from normal transshipment.</p>
<p>“Where’s Doctor Ling?” Another patient shouted with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>“We’ll be at the hospital soon. When we get to the hospital, we’ll be able to see Doctor Ling,” Ye Ming advised helplessly. This patient was a little hysterical. He would call Doctor Ling every now and then. However, they would often see similar patients.</p>
<p>Some seriously ill patients who had been sick for a long time were able to know all the doctors in their field like the back of their hand. This was similar to people who had been losing money by buying stocks for a long time. Gradually, not only could they call out names like Buffett, but they could also know the names of the fund managers, especially the financial experts.</p>
<p>The people who were the sickest would often regard one or a few of the doctors as a life-saving straw.</p>
<p>It was uncertain whether they could really save themselves, but for them, this was their last hope.</p>
<p>Ling ran’s hepatectomy had been carried out until now, and there were at least eight hundred patients who had been cured of liver diseases. Although there was not much publicity in the mass media, in the circle of patients with liver diseases, it was already the only one. His success rate and the prognosis of the patients could be said to have far surpassed most of the doctors in the country. In the eyes of some patients who were on the verge of death, he was more like a lifesaver.</p>
<p>“I want Doctor Ling to perform the surgery on me.” When the patient shouted the word “Doctor ling,” he sounded very loud.</p>
<p>“I know. We’re going to look for Doctor Ling to perform the surgery,” ye Ming answered.</p>
<p>“We want Doctor Ling to perform the surgery himself.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“It must be Doctor Ling!”</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ye Mingzhi responded and increased the dosage of the medicine for the patient. Then, he smiled helplessly at the vice-captain beside him and said, “I miss the ambulance at this time.”</p>
<p>The vice-captain smiled and said, “You have family members following you, right?”</p>
<p>“How much less trouble.” Ye Mingzhi used his words to hide his anxiety. When he saw the sign of the helipad on the roof of Yun Hua Hospital, his little heart almost jumped out of his chest.</p>
<p>A few doctors in white coats had already been waiting on the top of the building.</p>
<p>The most eye-catching one among them was a doctor standing in the middle. He had a big waist and a receding hairline. His thighs were thick and strong, and his pants looked like they were made of gold.</p>
<p>“Hybrid operating theater, let’s go.” The helicopter had just landed when the Doctor, who was as strong as an ox, rushed forward.</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi quickly cooperated. When he jumped off the helicopter, he asked, “You’re Doctor Lu, right?”</p>
<p>“I’m Lu Wenbin. Have we met before?” Lu Wenbin glanced at ye Mingzhi and said it very casually.</p>
<p>“We haven’t met before, but we’ll probably have frequent dealings with each other in the future. I’m the person in charge of the medical transportation team here, Ye Mingzhi.” Ye Mingzhi introduced himself to Lu Wenbin while he was busy with his work.</p>
<p>“OH.” Lu Wenbin let out a meaningful smile and helped him push the stretcher away.</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi knew that he was slightly behind. He thought for a few seconds and followed behind Lu Wenbin in disappointment.</p>
<p>“What’s Wrong?” The vice-captain asked in concern.</p>
<p>“I’m afraid that we’re going to be eliminated.” Ye mingzhi sighed.</p>
<p>The vice-captain was shocked. “It can’t be. Did that doctor just say that? He’s so arrogant?”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say it. If he did, I wouldn’t be so worried.”</p>
<p>“Then you’re really thinking too much.” The vice-captain comforted him and said, “Since he didn’t say it, let’s not make wild guesses…”</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi shook his head and glanced at the vice-captain. He said, “I just said that we’ll probably interact with each other often in the future. He just revealed a smile. This kind of smile…”</p>
<p>Ye mingzhi imitated Lu Wenbin. He only curled the corners of his mouth and gave the vice-captain an emoji with a fake smile.</p>
<p>“This…” the vice-captain sucked in a breath of cold air. “This… is not good.”</p>
<p>“Right? Let’s follow him.” Ye Mingzhi lowered his psychological expectations by one level again. He ran along with the stretcher in a depressed manner.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin escorted a few patients who were in transit along the way. He only heaved a sigh of relief when he returned to the operating theater. He rubbed his neck and complained, “I practiced my neck yesterday. In the end, my cheeks hurt so much that I can’t open my mouth today. It’s really strange.”</p>
<p>“Let me take a look.” Zuo Cidian boasted that he already had a foundation in the orthopedics department, so he took the initiative to show concern for his colleagues.</p>
<p>The corners of Lu Wenbin’s mouth twitched, and he smiled at Zuo Cidian.</p>
<p>“Jaw syndrome.” Zuo Cidian put on his gloves and pinched his cheeks. He quickly came to a conclusion. “What kind of hard food did you eat yesterday?”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it, I ate some bones…” lu Wenbin said and nodded. “That should be the problem. Sigh, there are too many bones left, and I don’t have a dog…”</p>
<p>“You can give them to everyone to chew on.” Zuo Cidian pursed his lips.</p>
<p>“There’s not much meat left in the middle of the elbow. It would be too embarrassing to give them to everyone.” Lu Wenbin laughed a few times and quickly ended the topic. He thought to himself, ‘If you guys chew on the bones for free every day.., ‘who will I sell the meat from my bones to?’</p>
<p>*Chi.*</p>
<p>Ling ran stepped on the airtight door and walked in.</p>
<p>“Are You Ready?” Ling ran put on his white coat and walked around the operating table to check.</p>
<p>“It’s a typical intrahepatic bile duct stone…” Lu Wenbin quickly went forward to report.</p>
<p>“Yes.” Ling ran looked at the video. To him, this was the type of surgery he was most familiar with, and he did a lot of it.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian coughed twice and asked, “Do you want to meet the person in charge of the transportation team?”</p>
<p>“Do I need to meet him?” Ling ran looked at Zuo cidian strangely after he looked at the video.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian understood what Ling ran meant and said helplessly, “If there’s a medical need, there shouldn’t be a need.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then let’s prepare for the surgery.” Ling ran nodded and began to enter the operating state.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1431: scruples</p>
<p>“Captain Ye, the last patient has also entered. Let’s Rest for a while.” The vice-captain looked at ye Mingzhi’s restless expression and couldn’t bear it.</p>
<p>He was originally such a calm person. There was once a patient who vomited blood during transport, but ye Mingzhi only did CPR according to the procedures and didn’t frown at all. There was once a patient who vomited rice during transport.., ye Ming knew that he was only performing CPR according to the procedures and didn’t frown at all. There was once a patient who vomited during transport, but ye Ming knew that he was only performing CPR according to the procedures and didn’t even wipe his brows.</p>
<p>Even when his ex-partner pretended to be pregnant to cause trouble, Ye Ming knew that he was still as calm as ever. Even when his ex-partner pretended to be pregnant to cause trouble, Ye Ming knew that he was still as calm as ever. Even when his ex-partner pretended to be pregnant to cause trouble again, he was still as calm as ever, ye Ming was still as calm as ever.</p>
<p>Especially this last part, which made the vice-captain admire him greatly. Although Captain Ye did not bring any medication that day and was worried that his poor performance would affect his reputation, no matter what.., ye Ming knew that he had proven himself to be a person who adhered to principles. If it was him, it was very likely that he would not be able to do this.</p>
<p>However, Ye Ming knew that he was too unstable today. The vice-captain started to feel anxious as he watched. What could be more worrisome than a partner getting pregnant?</p>
<p>“The first few surgeries went quite smoothly.”</p>
<p>After a long while, Ye Ming finally said in a low voice, “Under normal circumstances, Doctor Ling should be in a good mood.”</p>
<p>“That’s for sure. He performed three surgeries in one go, and all of them were completed within an hour. All the doctors in any hospital would feel that today was going to be a smooth day,” the vice-captain said cooperatively. He did not lie. Based on the surgeries that they had seen before, they did not need to perform any major surgeries. They only needed to perform minor surgeries. The chief surgeon would be in a very good mood if he could perform three surgeries in one go without making any mistakes.</p>
<p>It was just like how an ordinary person could complete a week’s worth of work in half a day and still complete it in a very smooth and relaxed manner. It was normal for the chief surgeon’s mood to soar in an instant.</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi shook his head. He stretched his neck and looked at the livestream on the screen diagonally above him. He said, “But look at Doctor Ling’s expression. What do you think of his mood right now?”</p>
<p>The vice-captain followed his instructions and looked over. He saw that underneath Ling ran’s extremely handsome and cool foundation was a solemn gaze and a serious expression.</p>
<p>“This… Doctor Ling’s expression hasn’t changed much in the past few hours.” The vice-captain paused for a moment, then, he said, “It’s not like it hasn’t changed at all. When he was bleeding just now, the way Doctor Ling looked at Lu Wenbin was quite… how should I put it?”</p>
<p>“Lu Wenbin’s face was so bad that it looked like he was caught cheating.” Ye Ming knew that he was observing him through the glass, then, he said, “Lu Wenbin’s expression doesn’t seem to be excited anymore. I think I can tell from his expression. As the saying goes, ‘spoiling the master is like spoiling the human form.’in his current state, it means that Doctor Ling is very likely unhappy.”</p>
<p>“He must be tired,” the vice-captain said.</p>
<p>“It’s not that tiring. Even though it’s three surgeries, it’s only been three hours. It’s equivalent to other doctors performing surgeries for an hour. He’s also the first assistant and not the chief surgeon. He’s not so tired that he looks like he just tore open the balcony window,” ye Mingzhi said with great insight, he continued, “Besides, the surgery is going so smoothly, and he’s performing three or four surgeries in one go. He should be quite excited, right? He’s so half-dead. Sigh, what you said makes sense. Perhaps something happened at home, or something happened in his career. It’s best if his wife cheated on him.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“If his wife cheated on him, or if he found out that his child wasn’t his biological child, that would be his own problem. I’m afraid that he might make a mistake in his work. For example, if he’s asked to replace our position, he definitely won’t be happy.”</p>
<p>The vice-captain said helplessly, “He’s replacing our position, and he’s still not happy? Does that count as a mistake in his work?”</p>
<p>Ye Ming said seriously, “Comrade Xiao Chen, we have to have a clear understanding of our position.”</p>
<p>“Alright, Comrade Old Ye.” The vice-captain said lazily, “If not for our clear understanding, we would have gone back to drink long ago.”</p>
<p>“Mm, we’re done tonight. After we’re free, we can drink,” ye Ming replied.</p>
<p>“Alright.” The vice-captain said before, and said jokingly, “We’re still in the emergency department. Don’t talk about when we’re free.”</p>
<p>“Do you think we won’t be free when we’re Free?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, people who talk about us when we’re free in the emergency department are all exhausted in the end.”</p>
<p>“Mm… But we should have said a lot of things when we’re free.”</p>
<p>The vice-captain: (OO)</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>A few investors were also holed up in their own rooms, waiting for the information to be delivered from the front and back.</p>
<p>Although they appeared to be calm on the surface, behind the scenes, a few people, including Hannah, were very concerned about Ling ran’s work.</p>
<p>Medical transshipment was already very popular in the United States, Germany, and other high-level developed countries. The demand of developing countries was constantly changing as the cost of medical transshipment changed.</p>
<p>In short, this was an industry with strong demand, and it was also a beautiful blue ocean. In the words of the investment community, it was a vast new racetrack.</p>
<p>Hannah and other early investors did not pay much attention to this track. What they really cared about was the size of the track.</p>
<p>Helicopters, fixed-wing aircraft, and medical equipment were not cheap. It could even be said that they were examples of high bid.</p>
<p>In the financial industry, the higher the bid, the more profits. How much money one could really make was one thing, and making money on a proportional basis had always been the norm in the financial industry.</p>
<p>The same principle applied to sales. The more expensive the item sold, the more likely it would be to earn money from sales.</p>
<p>However, the prerequisite for all of this was that the entire track had to be accessible.</p>
<p>The patient could not be sent to the hospital, and the hospital would not be able to treat him, or worse, the patient would suffer greater injuries during the transportation process..</p>
<p>“It’s done.”</p>
<p>In the operating theater, Ling ran threw down the scissors and announced the end of the surgery.</p>
<p>“Did the surgery go well? Did It succeed?” An investor asked impatiently.</p>
<p>“It went very well. There doesn’t seem to be any problem. It should have been a success.” The medical consultant that they specially invited was also in a remote connection state, and he came to a conclusion at the first moment.</p>
<p>“My understanding is that at least from the legal perspective, and even from your medical judgment, this surgery was also a success, right?” The investor began to translate in his own system.</p>
<p>“Yes,” the medical consultant replied, and then said, “In terms of surgery alone, it was done very well. It was a successful surgery. Ling ran from China, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, Ling ran from Yun Hua Hospital in China.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard of him. He did a really good job.”</p>
<p>“Okay, okay.” The investor did not care about that. He could not wait to stop the connection and turn his face to the other few people, he said, “Ladies and gentlemen, according to our previous plan, we should now send a large number of patients to Yun Hua to conduct a stress test on the entire system. Of course, this also includes the test on China’s civil aviation system.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>The investors nodded one after another.</p>
<p>“What about the replacement of the medical team requested by Doctor Ling?” Hannah asked.</p>
<p>“Give it to him. He can do whatever he wants.” The investors no longer had any scruples.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1432</p>
<p>“Doctor Ling, as you can see, our support for You is unlimited. It’s definitely the best configuration…” Hannah brought a few professional managers and bragged to Ling ran.</p>
<p>Ling ran carefully checked the emergency equipment in Falcon 2000 before he turned around, he said, “The configuration is okay, but there’s still room for modification. If you really need the best configuration, I can make a list.”</p>
<p>Hannah: W () W</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian came to his senses and was well-trained, he immediately said, “Doctor Ling likes this style of speaking. In fact, it is already very difficult for us, Doctor Ling, to seriously configure it. You, show us how to use this device.”</p>
<p>The one who was called was ye Mingzhi. He had just finished a day of medical transshipment and had been a continuing doctor for two days. Although he slept very little and was half-dead from fatigue, his conditioned reflex was trained.</p>
<p>When he heard zuo cidian say “You-know-who,” ye Mingzhi could not help but widen his eyes. However, he did not waste his two days in Yun Hua Hospital. In almost an instant, ye Mingzhi reacted and said with a smile, “No problem. I’ll demonstrate for everyone.”</p>
<p>Then, ye Mingzhi went forward, turned on a monitor, and started to demonstrate.</p>
<p>His demonstration was not very serious, and it was even a little perfunctory. However, the eyes of the surrounding investors lit up.</p>
<p>“Doctor Ling’s management ability is very good,” Hannah whispered in French.</p>
<p>“That’s right. I didn’t expect it to be a very serious and traditional management model.” The middle-aged elite investor nodded slightly, he commented, “The advantage brought by high-level technology makes it easy for him to appear in front of the staff in an authoritative manner…”</p>
<p>“This is a pleasant surprise. However, there is a guarantee that the project will be completed.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian smiled as he watched the investors conversing in various languages. He was neither embarrassed nor bored.</p>
<p>After doing things to this day, he had long lost interest in the flashy thing of mastering a few languages. He had even lost some of his attention.</p>
<p>As it turned out, a man who had mastered surgical techniques would not be affected when he performed surgery on patients who spoke any language. If he could afford to hire a translator, flattery could still be carried out smoothly. Sometimes, the language barrier would produce additional effects.</p>
<p>After the round of demonstration ended, Hannah adjusted her mood and regrouped, she said, “Doctor Ling, we are committed to providing the best service to our patients. As of now, yingren company has signed contracts with several banks and securities companies to provide high-standard medical transfer services to their high-net-worth people. As for the aircraft and medical facilities, we will continue to update and replace them in the next few days. You can rest assured about this. Our aircraft and medical facilities will remain above the mainstream level for the next few days.”</p>
<p>Ling ran had heard the other party speak before, and he listened carefully to the translation. He frowned a little strangely and said, “Maintain a standard above the mainstream level for the next few days? Why not maintain a standard above the mainstream level for now?”</p>
<p>“HMM?” Hannah was stunned for a moment. After a while, she finally reacted and said helplessly, “The standard of our medical aircraft and equipment now is already above the mainstream level.”</p>
<p>“HMM… is the standard so low?” Ling ran asked in surprise.</p>
<p>Hannah was stunned by the question. She subconsciously looked behind her.</p>
<p>A handsome man in a high-end suit stood out consciously, he said, “Doctor Ling, the Falcon 2000 is a medium-sized and large-scale business jet. It has two engines and is extremely fast. It can fly across the ocean and land with a full tank of fuel. This means that it can carry out many short-distance trips without needing to refuel in the middle. It is very suitable for medical transportation missions. “Moreover, this Falcon 2000 is basically new, and so is the medical equipment…”</p>
<p>“So, the standard is based on the business jet, with reference to its performance and usage time?” Ling ran seemed to have understood something, but he only frowned slightly. “Medium-sized and large-sized should be medium-sized and large-sized without considering the transport plane and passenger plane, right?”</p>
<p>Jun Gao was embarrassed for a second, he said, “This… transport aircraft and civilian passenger aircraft are considered large-sized aircraft. There are not many medical transport companies that use such aircraft. The cost is too high, and the carrying capacity is also wasted. Moreover, take-off and landing are also restricted. For example, there are twenty thousand or forty thousand commuting airports in the United States, and most of them can only take-off and landing medium-sized and small-sized aircraft. It would be a waste to use large aircraft.”</p>
<p>“There are also a lot of options other than large aircraft.” When Ling ran talked about professionalism, he would not lie to a few investors who had just read the information. After a few sentences, he said, “The Falcon 2000 can be used to meet the requirements at the moment.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian looked at the expressions of the few investors and felt that it was a little difficult to smooth out the situation. He could not twist Ling ran’s meaning, he could only say, “Doctor Ling… is just stating the facts. He doesn’t mean to target everyone.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. We all know Doctor Ling’s personality.” Hannah took a deep breath and changed her smile, she said, “Next, the time to test doctor Ling will come. We have arranged four surgeries in the next two days. If Doctor Ling completes the surgery to the customer’s satisfaction, we can officially sign the contract.”</p>
<p>“Four surgeries?” Ling ran’s expression changed slightly.</p>
<p>“It’s not a mandatory requirement. If you encounter any problems, we can discuss it again. After all, medical problems are a little more complicated.” Hannah looked at Ling Ran’s face and suddenly relaxed some of her requirements.</p>
<p>Ling ran shook his head and said, “The last time we transferred patients, we transferred four patients at once. Did you only arrange for four surgeries in the next two days?”</p>
<p>Hannah was stunned. She first turned around and communicated with the people behind her before she said, “If you think that the number of surgeries can be increased, we can also arrange more surgeries.”</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded and gave a slightly satisfied expression, which made the professional managers raise their heads and puffed out their chests.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian said from the side, “Arrange as many surgeries as possible. If there are only four surgeries in two days, this plane will be a waste.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Jungao agreed. He then looked at Hannah and smiled. “Doctor Ling, Doctor Zuo, why don’t you let Miss Hannah send you back to the city? We still have some other work here…”</p>
<p>“There’s no need for that. We still have to fly to another city to perform surgeries. The time is just right.” Zuo Cidian said goodbye in a hurry. The few of them waved their hands and got on Kost, who was waiting on the other side.</p>
<p>The plain and unadorned minibus stopped next to a Boeing 737 not far away from them. Then, someone on the plane came down to welcome them and respectfully led Ling ran and the others onto the plane.</p>
<p>Although the size of a Boeing 737 that could carry less than 200 passengers on a commercial airliner was only average, compared to the Falcon 2000 that could carry 19 people, it was really inferior.</p>
<p>“Don’t act on your own next time.” Hannah looked at Jungao sternly and walked up to the Falcon 2000, observing silently through the porthole.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1433: Yun Hua Hospital</p>
<p>In the afternoon.</p>
<p>The sun shone on the porthole, reflecting circles of water ripples. It was like a wave that had arrived in the distance and turned around.</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi yawned. Then, he saw the pilot come out of the cabin.</p>
<p>“Tired?” Ye Mingzhi greeted.</p>
<p>“Let the autopilot fly for a while first.” The pilot sat down casually and looked at the empty cabin. “I’m exhausted. We’ll change people when we get to Hainan. What will you do?”</p>
<p>“US? We’ll just endure it.” Ye Mingzhi’s face was wooden, he rubbed it hard and said, “We’re not like you guys. There’s no limit to our working hours. We can just lie down next to our posts when we’re tired and faint.”</p>
<p>“You don’t say. It’s quite safe to faint in an emergency plane.” The pilot laughed.</p>
<p>Ye Mingzhi chuckled.</p>
<p>His vice-captain was drinking water by the side. His eyes were deep as he said, “We shouldn’t have talked about idleness at that time…”</p>
<p>“Shh.” Several people, including Ye Mingzhi, made a move.</p>
<p>“I know, I know.” The vice-captain shook his head helplessly. After a while, he said, “You won’t shed tears until you see the coffin.”</p>
<p>“I saw it.”</p>
<p>“I was already crying.”</p>
<p>“I should have broken Captain Ye’s mouth the last time.”</p>
<p>The two nurses present joined in the conversation.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that his face was full of bitterness, so he could only shrug his shoulders. “The company is commercialized. At the very least, we don’t have to lock in Yun Hua Hospital anymore. This can be considered a good thing, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course it can be considered a good thing. Otherwise, the patients who have to undergo elective surgery every day will become medical flights,” the vice-captain replied, he smiled and said, “Now that we’re out of the hospital, we’ll naturally be free to do whatever we want…”</p>
<p>“Well said. Everyone, perform well later and show your professionalism. If we can make money ourselves, we won’t Be Tied to Yun Hua Hospital or Ling ran.” Ye Ming knew that it was impossible as he spoke, then, he laughed bitterly and said, “At least we can come out to relax.”</p>
<p>In the end, Hannah and the others did not sign a deep-bound contract with Ling ran. Because of that, the Falcon 2000 that Ye Ming knew that he served flew out of Yun Hua. Instead, they began the real medical transportation mission.</p>
<p>To a certain extent, this was also the behavior of Hannah and the other investors who forced Ling ran to do so.</p>
<p>However, Ye Ming knew that he did not care about that. At least, he knew that he did not have to be as tired as he was a few days ago.</p>
<p>Compared to the time he spent at Yun Hua Airport, the daily transshipment work was really too easy.</p>
<p>Half an hour later, Falcon 2000 slowly landed at the airport.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that after everyone was dressed properly, he made a call and confirmed, “We have arrived at the airport. has the helicopter arrived?”</p>
<p>“About 10 minutes.” Director Bo’s voice came from the other end of the phone. “The patient’s condition is stable. Wait a moment, I’ll get the emergency doctor to talk to you.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Ye Ming knew what he was going to say, so he started to ask about the medical measures that the other party had taken and record them. The three parties’doctors were even more complicated, but with the current conditions, there was no better choice.</p>
<p>Ye Ming kept talking until the cabin door opened, then he followed the others and ran down.</p>
<p>The helicopter stopped some distance away, and a car was used to transport it in the middle. When the two parties met and got on the plane, director Bo wiped his sweat, he apologized and explained to the patient’s family, “The medical transport in China is not mature yet, so it’s a little troublesome.”</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that he didn’t say anything. He didn’t care who the patient was. After all, when the patient and his family arrived at the hospital, they would forget a transport doctor like him.</p>
<p>“Where do you want to go?” Ye Ming asked as a matter of routine.</p>
<p>Patients or their family members who had the money and channels to use the medical transfer basically had the resources to use hospitals and doctors in Hong Kong, Singapore, or Tokyo. Among them, Singapore and Tokyo were the ceilings of the world’s medical system. In some aspects, they were not only not inferior to the United States, but also surpassed them.</p>
<p>This time, he was performing a real emergency transfer mission, which was the flight version of the ambulance that most people were familiar with. Naturally, he had to ask the patients and their family members for their opinions.</p>
<p>Different people usually had different tendencies. Patients who liked Tokyo, patients who liked Singapore, and even patients who wanted to fly to Europe or even the United States. In fact, this was not only related to their preferences, but also their identity and health insurance. Even very rich families, faced with this kind of transport costs that could easily cost millions of Yuan, were likely to have bills of tens of millions of yuan, they still had to consider economic factors.</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that as long as the other party’s request was not too outrageous, he would agree to it.</p>
<p>Therefore, while he was questioning, Ye Ming knew that he was actively checking the other party’s heart and brain condition.</p>
<p>The emergency department was most afraid of chest pain and stroke. This was an emergency in the emergency department, and they were all fatal emergencies. This could be seen from the fact that the emergency departments of all the hospitals had set up stroke and chest pain centers.</p>
<p>Besides this kind of super-critical situation, the scope of change could be bigger. Of course, most people would still consider the hospitals or doctors that were relatively close to them..</p>
<p>“Let’s go to Yun Hua.” The patients’families didn’t have much discussion. After confirming it once again, the man in the lead said it.</p>
<p>“Okay… eh? Go To Yun Hua?” Ye Ming knew that he was hearing things. Why did he have to run back now that he had just crawled out of the Tiger’s Den?</p>
<p>He looked at the patient seriously before he looked at hospital director Bo. He suspected that the latter was the culprit.</p>
<p>Hospital director Bo faced ye Ming’s gaze righteously and said after a while, “Doctor Ling ran from Yun Hua Hospital is an authoritative expert in hepatectomy in the world. This is the best choice recently.”</p>
<p>Ye Ming knew that he was even more certain that hospital director Bo or the Jun ‘an clinic that he was at had definitely done some work there.</p>
<p>However, even with his professional abilities, he could not refute director Bo’s words.</p>
<p>Ling ran was indeed a world-class authoritative expert in hepatectomy, and it was really the best choice in recent times. It was the neighboring countries. Ye Ming knew that the few experts he could think of were indeed powerful, however, it was not entirely true that they were more powerful and famous than Ling ran.</p>
<p>The medical transportation business itself was not a business that obeyed authority. To a certain extent, doctors in the medical transportation business had to provide professional information to their patients and family members. This included information about the doctors in the vicinity who were suitable for the symptoms.</p>
<p>In this regard, Jun ‘an clinic, which had been doing international medical treatment for a long time, not only did it do the right thing, but it was also extremely excellent.</p>
<p>“I understand. Let’s go to Yun Hua Hospital.” Ye mingzhi sighed secretly and sent someone to inform the pilot.</p>
<p>The pilot who was sitting in the cockpit was shocked when he received the news. He immediately opened the door and came out to confirm, “Fly back to Yun Hua Hospital?”</p>
<p>“Yes. The patient and his family members requested to go to Yun Hua Hospital.” Ye Mingzhi took a deep breath.</p>
<p>The pilot understood and looked at ye mingzhi with an auspicious look. “You really need to fix that mouth of yours.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1434</p>
<p>Huo Congjun stood at the fountain of Yun Hua Hospital with his hands on his waist, looking at the sky.</p>
<p>A helicopter flew over from afar. When it was not even the size of a pigeon, it made a beeping sound that was louder than a pigeon’s pot.</p>
<p>Beep Beep Beep..</p>
<p>Huo congjun scooped up fragrant garden that was passing by and gently twisted its neck. He casually patted its face to the other side and gently stroked its wings, he sighed, “Another helicopter. The Sign of Yun Hua Hospital’s emergency department is so bright that it’s turning purple.”</p>
<p>Xiang Manyuan turned its head with a “Ga” sound, and its throat was once again grabbed by fate.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun slowly played with it for a while before he threw it out.</p>
<p>Xiang Manyuan ran away like a bunch of doctors who were running to pick up the helicopter.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun returned to the emergency room with his hands behind his back, feeling satisfied. He then watched the group of doctors and nurses busy themselves.</p>
<p>In the past, if there were patients being transported over by helicopter, there would definitely be doctors who were at the level of chief physicians or associate chief physicians attending to them. This was because these were all extremely complicated situations.</p>
<p>But now, not to mention that the doctors and nurses in the emergency department were used to it, the abundant manpower also made Huo Congjun and the others not have to run around tirelessly anymore.</p>
<p>Huff, Huff, Huff..</p>
<p>Chief physician Tao jogged past Huo Congjun. As he ran, he asked in surprise, “Old Huo, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“UH… to take a look?” Huo Congjun did not know how to answer. He just watched director Tao stomp in front of him.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else, come and help. We’re all busy.” A man like director Tao who was about to retire was the most reckless. He did not even need to think before he spoke. When he commanded the director, it was as if he was commanding a disobedient Husky, in any case, he could just shout. If he was disobedient, then it was his fault.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun was slightly surprised. “Why are you busy?”</p>
<p>“You’re joking. We’re in the emergency department. Why are we busy in the emergency department?” Department director Tao looked at Huo Congjun like he was looking at a king of Huskies.</p>
<p>Huo congjun nodded slowly and shook his head firmly. “Our recent expansion has almost tripled in size. Will we still be unable to handle it?”</p>
<p>The emergency department had already filled up the number of staff needed to upgrade the emergency medical center. Correspondingly, the number of advanced doctors, housemen, and interns had also increased significantly. All in all, the current Yun Hua Hospital Emergency Medical Center could easily pull out two hundred doctors. This number was extremely terrifying in any hospital in the country.</p>
<p>In fact, almost all departments with this number of doctors would be able to set up their own hospital branches. If they did not set up their own hospital branches, or if they could not set up their own hospital branches, most of them would have to be split up.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun was nervous for a third of a second for no reason. In the blink of an eye, he relaxed and said to himself, “What are you panicking about? We Have Ling ran.”</p>
<p>“Of course. If it weren’t for Doctor Ling, we wouldn’t be so tired.” Department director Tao Gasped for air.</p>
<p>Huo Congjun was stunned for a moment before he came to a realization. “They were transported here by medical treatment? There are so many of them?”</p>
<p>Department director Tao replied with an “En”, he said, “All of them are seriously and seriously ill. Moreover, yingren company has started adding helicopters over there. Currently, four helicopters are on duty. Excluding the time for maintenance and repair, there are still two helicopters that can fly into the sky. Do you think that private companies will specialize in the airport business? “The ambulance business in the neighboring county has been stolen.”</p>
<p>“Transferring patients from other counties? It will be very expensive, right?”</p>
<p>“No matter how expensive it is, can it be more expensive than a black car? It’s several times more expensive than a proper ambulance. There will always be people who can afford it.” Director Tao chuckled, then, he said, “They have the cooperation of banks and securities firms. They are in finance. I don’t know anything about this. I just know that we are really an emergency medical center. The radiation range is two to three hundred kilometers.”</p>
<p>When Huo Congjun heard this, his eyes lit up.</p>
<p>He did not have many hobbies in his life. Other than insulting people, smoking, drinking, tea, insulting people, treating patients, performing surgeries, insulting people, watching anti-japanese dramas, patrolling the ward, holding international conferences, and insulting people, he did not have many hobbies, what he looked forward to the most was to see the expansion of his emergency medical center.</p>
<p>In this regard, Huo Congjun was a little like a farmer who grew vegetables. He always liked to dig a little bit of the land next door when he was renovating the trench to expand it a little.</p>
<p>Of course, Huo Congjun was even more comforted by Ling ran’s behavior, which made it seem like he had bought all the land next door.</p>
<p>“Let me help.” Huo congjun rolled up his sleeves and went into action.</p>
<p>Department director Tao pretended to stop him and said, “Department director, you just need to be in charge of the center. You Don’t have to go down personally.”</p>
<p>“Why would a doctor be in charge of the center? Besides, Ling ran will be in charge of commanding. He should be very familiar with this kind of situation by now,” Huo Congjun said, he casually followed department director Tao into the resuscitation room.</p>
<p>Department director Tao Chuckled and said in agreement, “Indeed. Ling ran sewed up a plane full of people in one breath this morning. There’s also an Englishman who flew over from Cambodia.”</p>
<p>“An Englishman who flew over from Cambodia? What’s the situation?” Huo Congjun entered the resuscitation room, but he did not have any work that he could interfere with. He could only remain in charge of the center.</p>
<p>Department director Tao was also not in a hurry. He explained calmly, “I heard from them that he probably went to the local hospital to have a heart stenting done. He did not succeed, and then he was transferred directly to our side.”</p>
<p>“The patient was chosen?”</p>
<p>“The Doctor chose him.”</p>
<p>“Doctor? A doctor from Vietnam?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I heard that he watched Ling ran’s teaching videos, and he even saw his case reports and the like.” When department director Tao said this, he sighed, then, he sighed. “I heard that all the local doctors will watch Ling Ran’s reports and videos of him performing surgeries. Can You Guess Why?”</p>
<p>In the resuscitation room, doctor Zhou, who was slacking off because he was the third assistant, could not help but laugh out loud.</p>
<p>The others did not laugh because their attention was focused on the resuscitation work. Doctor Zhou laughed because he was the one who was unnecessary during the resuscitation process.</p>
<p>The smile on Huo Congjun’s face disappeared quickly. Then, he pulled a long face and turned his head to say, “Little Zhou, tell me, why?”</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou did not even need to change his role, he said seriously, “I guess they want to look at something that can make their mood happy while they gain knowledge… of course, the most important thing is that Doctor Ling’s skills are too good. He attracted the attention of his foreign counterparts and was willing to learn from them.”</p>
<p>“HMM, the person who had a sexual intercourse that caused a myocardial infarction… was it a myocardial infarction?” Huo Congjun knew that Ling ran did not perform brain surgery, so he guessed that it was a heart problem.</p>
<p>Department director Tao nodded and said, “Yes.”</p>
<p>Huo congjun nodded. “Then, where is the Big Brother? Let me take a look.”</p>
<p>“Little Zhou, take department director Huo there.” Department director Tao called out his name.</p>
<p>“Alright.” Doctor Zhou took off his gloves and went forward to lead the way excitedly, he even introduced, “That foreigner is quite interesting. His chest oil is two feet thick, and his bones are quite hard. It’s just that his heart is relatively small, so he should have some congenital malformations. He even called out two at once…”</p>
<p>“Little Zhou.” Department director Huo Interrupted Doctor Zhou’s excitement.</p>
<p>“HM?” Doctor Zhou keenly sensed the danger.</p>
<p>Department director Huo asked, “Do you know why Old Tao asked you to lead the way for me?”</p>
<p>“No… I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Because there are so many people here, and you’re the only one who has nothing to do.”</p>
<p>“You can’t say that.” Doctor Zhou pretended to be unhappy and acted coquettishly. “Didn’t that patient also lie down and fall asleep…”</p>
<p>Department director Huo looked at Doctor Zhou sternly.</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou thought hard and said in a low voice, “I hope that no one in this world is sick. Why bother putting the medicine on the shelf and giving birth to dust…”</p>
<p>“I should put you on the shelf of the pharmacy.” Department director Huo was finally amused.</p>
<p>Doctor Zhou also secretly let out a sigh of relief. It was another day spent with intelligence. It was really hard to be a doctor.</p>

<p>Chapter 1435: There was a portrait</p>
<p>“He’s coming, he’s coming.” A few girls pushed and shoved each other. They ran from the door to a corner and looked through the glass.</p>
<p>Ling ran’s footsteps were as calm and handsome as ever.</p>
<p>“He should be able to see it, right?” The girls whispered among themselves.</p>
<p>“What if he can’t see it?”</p>
<p>“He should be able to see it.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian stood behind the few of them. He looked at the big flower basket that blocked the door. There was also a huge picture of Ling ran on it. He could not help but sigh. If he still could not see it, why would ling ran still need surgery, he could just lie behind the flower basket.</p>
<p>If a few burly men were to do such a thing, Zuo Cidian would have stepped forward to stop them. However, when he saw a few girls who were obviously still students putting out gifts in a star-chasing manner, Zuo Cidian was a little hesitant.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, Ling ran had already walked to the glass door.</p>
<p>There was a big flower basket and a big photo. They were looking at Ling ran. The expression on Ling Ran’s face was… the same as usual.</p>
<p>“Who gave it to you?” Ling ran stood beside the flower basket and asked. He did not find it annoying, nor did he find it special.</p>
<p>He had seen too many similar scenes, especially in school. The various tricks that the young girls came up with were always new. In comparison, the patients and their families that he knew after he entered the hospital.., his train of thought was obviously not that strange.</p>
<p>“It’s… It’s us…” a few young girls squeezed their way up to him.</p>
<p>“Thank you so much. The gifts are too expensive. They’re too expensive.” As Ling ran spoke, he took out a few chocolates from his pocket and gave them to the young girls.</p>
<p>“Thank you, Doctor Ling.” The girls thanked him tenderly and happily accepted the chocolates.</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded. Then, he looked into the distance and caught Zuo Cidian’s sharp gaze. He waved his hand and said, “Let’s see how convenient the flower basket is… put the photo away.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll ask if we can return it first. If we can’t, let’s set up a place.” Zuo Cidian first gave the proposal. After he got Ling ran’s permission, he started to work on it.</p>
<p>“That…” the girl at the end called out to Ling ran. She took two steps forward and handed Ling ran a USB flash drive. She said in a low voice, “Doctor Ling, this is for you.”</p>
<p>The corners of Zuo Cidian’s eyes were twitching. He was surprised to see that the profile picture on the USB flash drive seemed to be Ling ran, but he was still filled with curiosity and surprise.</p>
<p>“What’s inside?” Ling ran asked.</p>
<p>“Uh… ran coins.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“It’s called RAN. It’s a digital currency that I made using the standard of Erc-20 from ether workshop. There are a total of 1,000,000,000,000 copies in circulation, and the is Doctor Ling’s profile picture.” The girl spoke faster and faster, and she took a deep breath, “There are 500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,” he continued</p>
<p>Ling ran frowned. “500 trillion?”</p>
<p>“Because I’m an independent publisher, no one has used it yet, so 1,000,000,000,000,000,000 may not even be worth a dollar, but, but… I will constantly update the community and continuously increase the community’s functions. Once more people use it and more people support RAN, it will become valuable.” The little girl paused for a moment, he said in a low voice, “I believe that there will be people who are willing to hold a large amount of RAN for a long time and add bricks and tiles to it.”</p>
<p>Ling ran took it back with a slightly puzzled expression, but he said honestly, “I’ll go back and find out more about it.”</p>
<p>“Oh right, there’s also a lot of NTF in there. “It’s called asymmetric currency. You can think of it as unique digital information, such as videos, photos, and 3D images… please accept it…” the little girl tried her best to explain, it was so much so that the ponytail at the back of her head was twitching.</p>
<p>“Alright, thank you. I’ll accept it.” Ling ran thought for a moment and gestured to Zuo Cidian. Then, he turned to the little girls and said, “I’ll give you a few vouchers from yingren company in return…”</p>
<p>Then.., ling ran said to the girls, “Yingren Company is a medical transportation company. In the future, if you or someone around you is sick or injured, you can call Yingren Company. If you’re in Yun Hua, they’ll send a helicopter to pick you up. In a big city outside of the city, it can be an ambulance or a helicopter. In a small city, it can be an ambulance plus a fixed-wing aircraft to send you to a hospital in a big city at the fastest speed.”</p>
<p>“It’s good stuff. I hope that you won’t need it, but if you really need it, it’s most likely to help you return to your normal, peaceful life of chasing celebrities,” Zuo Cidian added, he then said slowly to the girls, “Everyone, can I register my name? It’ll be convenient for me to send something to you later…”</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>During the time between the surgeries, Ling RAN had someone take out a PAD, type in RAN’s social network address, and read it.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian turned around. When he saw it, he could not help but feel a little surprised. He said, “Are you really reading it?”</p>
<p>“I’ve already agreed to it,” Ling ran replied and said, “There are also some interesting things.”</p>
<p>“Are there?” Zuo Cidian was even more surprised.</p>
<p>“Yes, NTF is equivalent to a digital collection. It can collect some meaningful scenes and pictures.” Ling ran nodded slightly. He then pointed at the USB drive and said, “Help me customize a batch of USB drives.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Even though Zuo Cidian did not understand the situation, he had never been hesitant in carrying out Ling ran’s orders.</p>
<p>Ling ran continued to read the posts in the community. Because there were not many of them, he quickly finished reading most of them.</p>
<p>After that, Ling ran even tried to buy a small amount of ran coins. After he familiarized himself with the whole process, he put down the PAD and took a ten-minute nap.</p>
<p>During this period of time, the doctors from each treatment group would take care of the patients.</p>
<p>It was not until the afternoon that another helicopter sent the emergency department over.</p>
<p>A few interns rushed over immediately. When they received the patient, their gazes were inevitably attracted by the paramedics who came on the same plane.</p>
<p>“The patient is for Doctor Ling.” The paramedics wore a hat. Their long legs were slender and strong, and the few interns avoided looking at them.</p>
<p>“The patient will be assigned by Doctor Ling.” Wang Jia heard the voice coming over and explained. However, she raised her head in surprise and said, “You are Lu Jinling from Golden Deer Company, right? The one who likes to ride motorcycles?”</p>
<p>“I bought a helicopter.” Lu Jinling said proudly, “Our Golden Deer Company actively responded to Doctor Ling’s proposal. I brought this one back from the neighboring city. He is rich and has good health. Many of his bones are broken.”</p>
<p>“UH, thank you?” Wang Jia didn’t know how to answer.</p>
<p>Lu Jinling curled her lips. “You’re welcome. A helicopter doing first aid is much more handsome than an ambulance. Now, if word gets out, we also have a company with a helicopter. Oh right, nurse Wang, have you been promoted?”</p>
<p>“Buy two apartments.” Wang Jia couldn’t lose in this kind of competition. She pretended to be calm and said, “I often go out with Doctor Ling to perform freelance surgeries.”</p>
<p>“But after we have helicopters, the number of freelance surgeries will decrease, right?” Lu Jinling laughed out loud.</p>
<p>Wang Jia said with a faint smile, “Doctor Ling’s surgery can not be finished. How many helicopters do you have?”</p>
<p>“Well… your idea… makes sense.” Lu Jinling pondered.</p>
<p>Wang Jia inexplicably regretted it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1436: see Mom and Dad</p>
<p>“RAN coins? That’s quite daring. Well, the community is doing well too.” Tian Qi scanned the RAN community on her notebook.</p>
<p>As one of the many digital coins issued by ether market, ran coins couldn’t be any smaller. On top of it, there were small coins that had been in operation for many years, small coins that had been in operation for many years and had a stable community, small coins that had been in operation for many years and had a stable community and a prosperous community. On top of that, there were also small coins that had been logged into small exchanges, there were small currencies that already had a certain price. There were also small currencies that had been developed for new uses and had a certain application scenario. On top of that, there were small currencies that ordinary people could come into contact with and log into larger exchanges, although the price of these small currencies was still the existence of multiple zeros after the decimal point, as far as the pyramid of digital currencies was concerned, they were already an extremely high-level existence. It was equivalent to pancakes, fruits, eggs, and two intestines, it was like adding soy sauce and soy milk.</p>
<p>Tian Qi did not know much about this aspect of information, but this did not prevent her from being vigilant about the situation related to “Ran.”</p>
<p>“Buy some ran coins and some aether workshop coins.” Tian Qi thought for a moment and said, “I’ll buy ran coins personally. I’ll use the family fund for the aether workshop coins.”</p>
<p>“There’s no problem with the aether workshop.” The assistant in the Celine suit made a record and said, “As far as I know, you can’t buy ran coins directly yet.”</p>
<p>“You can’t buy them?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the new currency hasn’t been publicly released yet, so there’s no price. Its circulation is mainly based on the contributions of the community as well as gifts.” The assistant paused for a moment, “According to the agreement, Mr. Ling ran should be the largest holder of ran coins. The founder only owns 1% of ran coins. The distribution will be based on the community contributions. and…”</p>
<p>Tian Qi raised her head and glanced at her assistant.</p>
<p>The assistant smiled a little embarrassedly, she said in a low voice, “Unlike most digital currencies, RAN’s community contributions are not only targeted at RAN’s agreement, or market development, etc. . When the corresponding videos or photos are released and made into NTF types, they will be allocated ran coins by the system… the corresponding videos and photos usually refer to Doctor Ling ran.”</p>
<p>“I understand.” Tian Qi nodded heavily and said slowly, “Pay attention to the key points and report at any time.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” The assistant drew three five-stars in front of the paper.</p>
<p>“Where’s Doctor Ling?” Tian Qi got up and tidied up her clothes.</p>
<p>“He’s in the hybrid operating theater.” The assistants had some understanding of the various rooms in the hospital.</p>
<p>Tian Qi could not help but smile, she said, “The good thing about a doctor’s boyfriend is that you don’t have to worry about him running away and not being able to find him… Oh right, are you using the Da Vinci robot to perform the surgery? “I heard that you can drink coffee when you use that machine. Get someone to send some coffee beans to them.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I’ll get someone to send them directly to their lounge,” the assistant agreed. In fact, the coffee beans had already been sent over on a regular basis, but since Tian Qi had given the order, she would re-examine and revise them.</p>
<p>Tian Qi thought for a moment and said, “Let’s go directly to the lounge. Oh right, did my uncle send over beef?”</p>
<p>“Yes, during the Brazilian festival, they slaughtered three lumps and sent over half of the Tenderloin and some shoulder meat. They sent it over this morning.”</p>
<p>“Only half of the Tenderloin.” Tian Qi curled her lips. “Let the Chef roast it. Doctor Ling likes it with more juice.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” The assistant continued to agree and took notes.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>In the waiting room.</p>
<p>While Tian Qi waited, she slowly signed a few documents. After she finished, she stretched and became happy again. “Doctor Ling’s side is better. It’s easy and efficient.”</p>
<p>The assistant put away the signed documents with a smile.</p>
<p>“Are there any more documents to sign?” Tian Qi looked at the time and decided to work harder.</p>
<p>“There are no more urgent documents,” the assistant said in a low voice.</p>
<p>“It’s okay. I’m very efficient now.” Tian Qi stretched her elbow and said, “I’ve decided to learn from Doctor Ling.”</p>
<p>“Please wait a moment.” The assistant turned around and made a phone call. In just a few minutes, two bodyguards in black suits came in with two boxes, followed by two more, followed by two more..</p>
<p>Tian Qi was stunned for a moment. “Didn’t I sign a lot of documents this morning?”</p>
<p>“There are a lot of documents that are not in a hurry.” The assistant smiled and opened one of the documents for Tian Qi.</p>
<p>Tian Qi curled her lips and had to lower her head to read it.</p>
<p>One document, two documents..</p>
<p>“Eh?” Tian Qi suddenly stopped and frowned, she said, “My family bought another ranch? “I remember that in the past few months, I seem to have bought quite a few ranches.”</p>
<p>“Can you help me pull up the purchase records of the previous ranches? who made the decision?”</p>
<p>“Pull up the decision-making and approval process as well.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” The assistant immediately followed her instructions.</p>
<p>“I’ve bought quite a few batches of cattle breeds as well. I thought only uncle liked animal husbandry…” as Tian Qi spoke, she continued to read through the documents. She flipped through them very quickly, but she did not miss any information that she should have obtained.</p>
<p>After a while, the assistant returned with the PAD and placed it in front of Tian Qi. She whispered, “The ranch is basically bought and selected by your mother. The executors are all different…”</p>
<p>“Your mother bought it? She doesn’t like the ranch, right?” Tian Qi was a little puzzled.</p>
<p>The assistant swiped the PAD and displayed a few times. Then, she whispered, “Maybe your mother thought that you might want the ranch and cattle in the future…”</p>
<p>“Why would i…” Tian Qi was halfway through her sentence when she suddenly realized something and her face turned slightly red.</p>
<p>The assistant smiled and did not say anything else. That was all she dared to say.</p>
<p>Tian Qi, on the other hand, took matters into her own hands and listed out the items her parents had recently purchased. She was now the person in charge of the family trust, the family fund, and many related organizations. She only had the authority to look at the records.</p>
<p>It could be seen that her parents actually had no intention of hiding it. Many items were purchased by people who were more casual, but some items were more likely to be purchased personally..</p>
<p>Tian Qi scanned through the ranch’s cattle breeds and other places. After thinking for a while, she pulled up the family’s insurance records. Sure enough, she found a long list of jewelry insurance policies, including a 22-carat diamond ring, a necklace inlaid with emeralds and sapphires that weighed more than 200 carats, and a pair of bracelets full of emerald..</p>
<p>Tian Qi was in a daze, and her eyes reddened unconsciously.</p>
<p>“Put away the documents. I don’t want to look at them anymore.” Tian Qi pushed the documents in front of her.</p>
<p>“Okay.” The assistant personally organized the documents. When he called for someone to come over, only a man in a black suit came. The latter pushed a small cart over and prepared to take the elevator.</p>
<p>Tian Qi rearranged her makeup and looked out of the window. She waited for a while before she smiled when Ling ran came out.</p>
<p>“Ling ran, do you want to go to my house and see my parents?” When Tian Qi saw Ling ran, she asked the first thing she did to prevent the courage she mustered from dissipating again.</p>
<p>Ling ran only thought for a second before he nodded and said, “Sure.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1437: chief surgeon</p>
<p>“Rest? Are you not feeling well?” Huo Congjun was originally sitting in a chair, he crossed his legs and pretended to be a patient recovering from a weak heart bypass. However, when he heard what Ling ran said, he immediately stood up, his face was full of concern. “I told you that it’s not okay to stay up late and perform surgeries day after day. You’re still young now. No matter how good your body is, it’s still supported by your foundation in the past…”</p>
<p>“I’m going to meet Tian Qi’s parents,” Ling ran interrupted Huo Congjun’s rambling and said, “The journey is quite far. It might take two to three days… maybe three to four days, so I need to take a leave of absence…”</p>
<p>Huo Congjun was even more shocked. After a few seconds, he finally reacted and said solemnly, “Why are you still fussing about time? Don’t even mention three to four days. Back then, I worked at my father-in-law’s house for several months!”</p>
<p>“Do you need to work?” Ling ran’s expression became serious as he said, “Then, I’ll bring the tracheotomy box…”</p>
<p>“No, no, no…” Huo Congjun was panicking. He was afraid that if he could not explain it clearly, something strange would happen, but he was also afraid that if he explained it clearly, something strange would happen. “You… If you look like this, Tian Qi can do it, but her parents definitely can’t… If you look like this, I’ll prepare some tea and wine for you. You can bring it over to her parents, and then you can change your clothes…”</p>
<p>Ling ran was puzzled. “Change your clothes?”</p>
<p>“Change your clothes to look better…” Huo Congjun said out of habit and patted his forehead. “Look at my IQ. Forget it. You Don’t have to wear a white coat.”</p>
<p>“Okay.” Ling ran did not ask too many questions. When it came to social issues, he usually chose to trust others.</p>
<p>Huo congjun nodded solemnly. He thought for a moment before he said, “Your current rank is also a problem. It’s mainly because of your reputation.”</p>
<p>“HMM?”</p>
<p>“Wait, I’ll think of a way. It has to sound better.”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter about the title.” Ling ran’s attitude was the same as always. In his life experience, the influence of whether he had a title or not was very weak. It was just like when he was in primary school and went home for the New Year, regardless of whether Ling ran brought the Three Good Students’award certificate or not, his relatives and friends’attitude towards him was the same as always.</p>
<p>Huo congjun clearly had a completely different life experience. He shook his head solemnly and said, “No. Regardless of whether Tian Qi’s family members care about what they should have and what they can have, we still have to prepare. Wait…”</p>
<p>As he spoke, Huo Congjun picked up the phone and dialed the number.</p>
<p>“It might be a little noisy later. You can wait outside.” Huo Congjun put down the microphone at the last minute and reminded Ling ran.</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded and immediately turned to leave. If department director Huo said that it would be noisy, then it would really be noisy later.</p>
<p>Sure enough, it did not take long before a loud shout came from the room.</p>
<p>The young doctors who passed by the room were all terrified. They frantically confirmed the existence of the people around them. They kept having the feeling that someone was about to become a cadaver.</p>
<p>After a long time, Huo Congjun pushed open the door and came out. He did not say anything. He took his phone and rushed out of the door.</p>
<p>Compared to the Tian family, the resources that he could use were too small. However, since Ling ran was going to meet the Tian family’s parents, Huo Congjun immediately felt a sense of crisis. Some resources were not needed for now.., if he was too embarrassed to use them now, how long would he have to wait for them to use them!</p>
<p>Ling ran did not realize anything at first. When he returned to the operating theater and conveniently performed two heart bypass surgeries, he came out and saw Zuo Cidian’s restless expression. He then asked, “What happened?”</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, Ling ran would not pay too much attention to the mental state of others. However, Zuo Cidian’s behavior was too obvious, because he really sat up and sat down, that was why Ling ran first suspected whether he had hemorrhoids.</p>
<p>“Um… Doctor Ling…” Zuo Cidian grabbed Ling ran and found a corner. He asked in a low voice, “Are you leaving?”</p>
<p>When Zuo Cidian asked this question, the other doctors also looked over.</p>
<p>Although they could not be said to be anxious, the uneasiness on their faces was still there.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian avoided Ling ran and said in an extremely serious tone, “I don’t have any other intentions. I just want to say that if you’re leaving, please bring me along.”</p>
<p>Ling ran asked in return, “Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Anywhere is fine.” Zuo Cidian replied and noticed Ling ran’s expression. He could not help but Blink. “You’re not going to change hospitals?”</p>
<p>In his impression, Ling ran had never lied. Hence, he was also straightforward just now. However, at this moment, Zuo Cidian was a little uncertain about the news he received.</p>
<p>Ling ran shook his head slowly. “I have no intention of changing hospitals.”</p>
<p>“In that case… my source of information is also quite reliable…” Zuo Cidian scratched his head.</p>
<p>Ling ran did not even bother to ask about the whole story. There were all sorts of strange things happening around him. It was not uncommon for girls to pounce on him when they pretended that something big had happened, such as the Doomsday, ling ran had already experienced it dozens of times.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was different. There were too few truly big things happening around him. For Zuo Cidian, what happened to Ling ran was the biggest and most important thing.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian racked his brain for a long time. He quietly made a few phone calls, and when he finally got something out of it, he went to Ling ran’s side again and asked in a low voice, “Doctor Ling, did you know that department director Huo is helping you fight for the position of chief surgeon of the Emergency Medical Center?”</p>
<p>Ling ran thought about it for a moment and said, “He said that he would help me get a title.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.” Zuo Cidian’s eyes shone with envy as he spoke. “I heard that department director Huo has proposed to reorganize the Emergency Medical Center. He wants to split the current department outside the hospital into the emergency department, The Dispatch Department, the car control department, and so on. There will also be the emergency department, the internal department, the internal department, the internal department, the surgery department, the Anesthesiology Department, the Radiology Department, the Hemodialysis Department, the EICU, and so on… think about it, how can the hospital not be in a mess when he suddenly calls for help?”</p>
<p>Ling ran listened and thought for a few seconds before he asked, “Didn’t the others know that department director Huo wanted to make a big emergency call?”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was speechless.</p>
<p>After a while, Zuo Cidian came back to his senses and said, “So, department director Huo was also the one who spread the news that you might leave?”</p>
<p>Ling ran lowered his head and read the book. He did not seem interested in participating.</p>
<p>Zuo cidian muttered to himself, “It can only be like this. If you’re going to leave, the hospital will do its best to keep you here. Otherwise, even if the vice presidents of the hospital want to make arrangements for you, they won’t be able to…”</p>
<p>Ling ran raised his head at that moment and said, “Department director Huo just called to slander me.”</p>
<p>“It’s probably a habitual operation. Forget about other things, just the first-aid system that you set up, the hospital directors will have to bow down to you.” As Zuo Cidian spoke, he felt relieved, he said, “Doctor Ling, should I inform the doctors under me? I don’t want everyone to be too worried.”</p>
<p>“Okay,” Ling ran answered.</p>
<p>“If there’s nothing else, I’ll go over now.” Zuo Cidian’s entire body relaxed, and he looked like a rough-skinned old monkey that had been massaged.</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded again, and he answered as usual, “I’ll take about three days off from work to meet Tian Qi’s parents.”</p>
<p>*Thud Thud.*</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian’s fur, subcutaneous fat, and muscles all tensed up. He looked like an old monkey that had been massaged. “Doctor Ling, you can talk about this first!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1438: high-level treasure chest</p>
<p>“Your son is going to see Tian Qi’s parents?” Ling Jiezhou repeated Zuo Cidian’s words, and his expression immediately looked as if it had become a lump.</p>
<p>Tao Ping’s hand that was brewing the tea also stopped. Then, she carefully put the purple clay pot away. She touched the neck of the pot and asked with surprise, “So fast?”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian put on a solemn look and nodded his head vigorously.</p>
<p>“Actually, I should have expected it.” Ling Jiezhou noticed his wife’s bad expression and quickly persuaded her, “Our son… Girls will definitely cut the Gordian knot with a quick knife…”</p>
<p>“Who is the quick knife and who is the Gordian Knot?” Tao Ping glared and said, “You are not allowed to talk nonsense in the future, especially in the future. You have to be more careful with your words and actions…”</p>
<p>Ling Jiezhou glanced at Zuo Cidian next to him and said in a steady tone, “I will listen to you, wife.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was expressionless, as if he did not hear the boss’father admit defeat.</p>
<p>Tao Ping acknowledged him with a satisfied “Mm.” Then, her expression repeated itself before she glared at Ling Jiezhou again. “What if Ling ran also listens to his wife?”</p>
<p>Ling Jiezhou’s eyes were glazed over. He thought to himself, ‘why did the difficulty of coaxing his wife suddenly increase by so much?!’</p>
<p>Zuo cidian whispered to help, “Doctor Ling always has his own way of doing things. It’s very difficult for him to change because of other people.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if Tian Qi’s parents are easy to get along with.” Tao Ping sighed again and stood up. “I’ll go get some tea.”</p>
<p>“What tea? I’ll go,” Ling Jiezhou said quickly.</p>
<p>“When I Married You, didn’t I bring some class chapters here and let my son take some with him? Back then, he was old time tea. Now, it’s not a disgrace to take it out,” Tao Ping said, she stood up and said, “They’re in the innermost part of the tea room. Come with me to get them.”</p>
<p>“Okay…” ling Jiezhou answered, and then he said with some doubt, “I remember that you drank all the tea long ago, right?”</p>
<p>“I bought some later,” Tao Ping said, and then she emphasized, “I bought them later. These are still the ones I brought when I married you back then.”</p>
<p>Ling Jiezhou nodded wisely. “Alright, I’ll remember them.”</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Tian family.</p>
<p>The Old Butler, Ba Zhang, who had served the family for many years, personally drove his Aston Martin to and fro between the family’s various pastures and vacation homes.</p>
<p>The manpower resources in these places were meager, and it was impossible for them to receive the same attention as the buildings in the city. There were many historical problems and hygiene blind spots. Even though they were not sure if Ling ran would come and take a look, but.., considering the character of this new son-in-law and the fact that he was highly regarded as an adult, the family assets management committee and the Professional Management Committee did not dare to let their guard down. Not only did they hire several meeting companies on a temporary basis.., they also mobilized the younger members of the family to participate actively.</p>
<p>Ba Zhang was gratified to see that in every ranch and farm, there were young family members helping to wash the horses, wash the cars, tidy up the wine cellar, and tend to the hunting grounds. The older family members.., would command the service staff of their small family,</p>
<p>they would be busy in the family grounds.</p>
<p>After continuously supervising the work for a few days, Ba Zhang returned to the family mansion and saw a thriving scene.</p>
<p>Hundreds of kilometers of the mansion’s internal roads had been repaved. The hiking trails that had not been repaired for more than a decade, as well as the rockery, sculptures, lighthouses, and other large buildings had been re-examined and redecorated, the Central Lake, which had not been cleared for many years, as well as the neighboring Wind Lake, Shenhu Lake, and the house’s internal waterways had all been cleaned up. Some of the thousands of tons of fish turtles that had been netted were returned to the lake, and some were used to improve the food.</p>
<p>Ba Zhang only felt that his entire body was full of energy. He excitedly came to mistress’side and slightly suppressed his voice, still, he could not help but raise his voice. “Mistress, Ba Zhang is back. The Zhuangzi outside has prepared quite well. There are some minor problems that have basically been resolved. I will follow up later.”</p>
<p>“Okay, we’re not afraid of anything. The more we prepare, the easier it will be to talk.” Mother Tian said with a light sigh and a smile on her face, she said, “I remember the first time I heard the word ‘leftover woman’, I felt a little nervous. Qiqi was too picky. When she was young, she had to pick out the broken rice grains when she ate rice. Later on, she became more and more beautiful, read more and more books, and the company became better and better. I became more and more worried…”</p>
<p>“Miss Tian Qi is so outstanding. Madam, you don’t have to worry.” Ba Zhang chimed in at the right time.</p>
<p>Mother Tian snorted smugly, but she shook her head, she said, “How can a mother not worry about her daughter. “In fact, if she were ordinary, like those young ladies in the family who married after they studied in Cambridge or Oxford, I wouldn’t be afraid even if she picked a little more. But she’s so good. If she could only marry an ordinary boy, I wouldn’t be convinced, let alone Qiqi.”</p>
<p>BA zhang said, “Doctor Ling ran is indeed very special.”</p>
<p>“He’s more than special.” Mother Tian laughed. “He’s very good-looking.”</p>
<p>Ba Zhang was silent. He could not catch up with her words.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Mother Tian’s emotions came and went quickly. When her expression was satisfied, father Tian also slowly walked over.</p>
<p>However, unlike mother Tian’s luxurious clothes, Father Tian was dressed casually. The t-shirt on his upper body was short-sleeved, revealing his well-dressed and powerful arms.</p>
<p>“You went to the gym?” Mother Tian looked at her husband and was not surprised at all.</p>
<p>Father Tian hummed and said, “I let coach Liu practice boxing with me for a while to vent his anger.”</p>
<p>“Everyone said that your heart is not good, why did you go to boxing again?” Mother Tian could not help but complain, “Little Ling is coming, so you should take care of the group’s matters and rest more. When you see people, you should be more energetic.”</p>
<p>“I’m not happy.” Tian Qi’s father’s face was stiff. “When I think of my daughter bringing a brat to my house, I want to beat him up. Otherwise, my heart will be pumping so hard… just like this… hmm…”</p>
<p>“Don’t think that way. Even if my daughter gets married…” as Tian Qi’s mother spoke, she suddenly realized that her husband’s expression was surprisingly terrible.</p>
<p>“Doctor.” Tian Qi’s father held his chest and slowly sat down. The T-shirt on his chest was wet with sweat, revealing his excellent figure.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>Tian Qi leaned against Ling ran and introduced the luggage in the cabin to him one by one. From time to time, she would even touch ling ran with her hand, she then said, “The tuxedo… sportswear… suit… Zhongshan suit… hunting suit… is prepared for you… When you wear it. You can choose what you like… You Don’t have to be so strict. If you don’t like it, you don’t have to wear it. No one dares to say anything…”</p>
<p>Ling ran replied casually, “Okay.” He could not say whether he liked clothes or not, so he just followed Tian Qi’s arrangements.</p>
<p>Tian Qi felt a little relaxed and at ease. She simply enjoyed the pleasure of going out with Ling ran. After a while, she even pointed at the clouds outside the porthole and started to chat.</p>
<p>While she was happy, the phone on the plane suddenly rang.</p>
<p>“Dad…” Tian Qi picked up the microphone. When she heard the voice inside, her eyes were filled with tears.</p>
<p>“Tell them to fly to Shanghai. We’ll also turn to Shanghai.” Ling ran heard the voice inside and immediately made a decision. He said, “Tell the helicopter to prepare at the airport. I’ll inform the hospital to prepare now.”</p>
<p>Tian Qi silently calculated the distance and time. She felt a little more at ease in her heart. She gave Ling ran a gentle hug, then picked up the phone and started talking.</p>
<p>After making various arrangements, Tian Qi put down the microphone again. She then looked at Ling ran and asked, “Do you want to prepare any equipment? I remember that all of you doctors have some equipment that you’re used to using…”</p>
<p>“I brought them with me.” Ling ran pursed his lips at a big black box at the end of the cabin.</p>
<p>Tian Qi looked at the inconspicuous black box and hid in the bushes of her LV box. She could not help but be stunned for a moment.</p>
<p>At the same time, the system interface popped up in front of Ling ran.</p>
<p>[ mission: fly to save people. ]</p>
<p>[ mission content: arrive at the operating theater of the hospital before the patient dies. ].</p>
<p>-LSB- rewaAdvancednTreasuresChesthest. ].</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1439: one hundred percent</p>
<p>“Open the treasure chest.” At this time, Ling ran did not hesitate at all. He chose to open the high-level treasure chest as his first choice.</p>
<p>A golden and gorgeous book immediately jumped out of the high-level treasure chest.</p>
<p>In the air, the book automatically opened its title page, revealing a line of words inside:</p>
<p>A surgery with one hundred percent success rate — no matter how difficult the surgery was, as long as there was a theoretical success rate, there was a one hundred percent success rate.</p>
<p>Ling ran could not help but read this line of words twice.</p>
<p>As a doctor, he knew the power of this surgery much better than ordinary people.</p>
<p>This was not just a surgery that could be completed with 100% success rate. If he used this book to verify the theoretical surgery, it would be even more amazing. For example, the “Head-changing surgery” that was once hyped up by the media was not only an ethical problem, but it was also more of a technical constraint in reality. It was a super surgery that involved dozens of people working together, but whether or not it would be completed in the end.., it was too much of a test of luck.</p>
<p>And there were very few chances for such verification. Very few people would be willing to perform such an experimental surgery. It would take a lot of time to apply for and carry out the surgery, and the probability of failing once and then doing it again was even lower. Therefore, if there was a theoretical success rate and there was a 100% chance of successfully completing the surgery, then it would be of great significance for an experimental surgery or a pioneering surgery.</p>
<p>“Ling ran, Will Father Be Alright?” After Tian Qi completed a series of coordination tasks, she looked at the plane turning around and became even more worried. She grabbed Ling ran’s arm tightly.</p>
<p>Ling ran waved his hand and put away the gorgeous golden book. Then, he nodded at Tian Qi and said, “There’s a 100% chance that he’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>It was absolutely irrational to answer like that when he was still uncertain about his father-in-law’s condition. However, when he saw Tian Qi’s worried look, Ling ran’s rationality wavered without hesitation.</p>
<p>“You should follow up on the situation. It’s best if you ask a random doctor about his condition directly. Also, if you need surgery, you must promise that I’ll do it.” Ling ran made a serious request to Tian Qi. He had seen too many cases where family members changed their minds during his years as a doctor. In this regard, the wealthy families or high-level intellectual families that he had come into contact with were not always able to calmly make decisions that were beneficial to the patient when they were faced with a life-and-death test.</p>
<p>Tian Qi immediately picked up the microphone after being reminded and connected again.</p>
<p>Soon, low voices of debate could be heard from the microphone.</p>
<p>Tian Qi frowned and listened for half a minute. Then, she signaled for the others in the cabin to leave and turned on the speakerphone.</p>
<p>A man and a woman were debating in Chinese and English respectively, and there were people constantly joining in the middle.</p>
<p>The focus of their discussion was precisely the question of where Father Tian would be treated and who would be the one to treat him.</p>
<p>Compared to Ling ran’s initial proposal, the few of them had suggested cities, Hong Kong, Seoul, and Tokyo. There were seven or eight medical teams available to choose from, and they could all be said to be reasonable.</p>
<p>After all, according to the judgment of the Tian family’s family doctor, Father Tian’s most likely cause was an aortic dissection, and although an aortic dissection was extremely dangerous, the death rate would increase by one point every hour, however, Father Tian’s Gulfstream 650 could fly 1,200 kilometers in an hour at its maximum speed, which was equivalent to the distance between Shanghai and Tokyo. If he immediately adjusted the direction now, he could save some time. Therefore, the distance was not the biggest problem.</p>
<p>As for the medical team, regardless of whether they were professionals or non-professionals, they could make their own judgment with reasonable evidence. Every name that was mentioned at this moment could be said to be famous, it could be said that it was the best choice for the Great Vascular Surgery Department in the Flying Circle for a few hours.</p>
<p>Ling ran listened quietly for two minutes before he interjected, “I’m Ling ran. I have a suggestion.”</p>
<p>The conference call that was in progress came to an abrupt end.</p>
<p>Someone said in a low voice, “Tian Qi, you didn’t say that Doctor Ling was listening… we didn’t mean to target him. Doctor Ling, you’re one of the best heart surgeons. I’ve seen you on many lists, but I’m more worried that your relationship with Miss Tian Qi will affect your medical judgment. I don’t have any other intentions. I just want to find the most suitable doctor…”</p>
<p>“I don’t object to you looking for other doctors, but I suggest that you invite them to Shanghai.” Ling ran paused for a moment, he then said, “I only need fifty minutes to reach the hospital in Shanghai. When Mr. Tian arrives, I’ll have just finished preparing to wash my hands before the surgery. I can guarantee that as long as Mr. Tian is sent to the operating theater where I’m at, he won’t die.”</p>
<p>The phone that was slightly ringing just now suddenly seemed to have crashed.</p>
<p>Ling ran did not care about that. After waiting for a few seconds, he said, “After your doctor arrives, you can decide whether you need to take over or not based on the situation. I think that this is the plan with the highest survival rate for Mr. Tian at this stage.”</p>
<p>“I understand. We’ll follow the plan that Ling ran said.” When mother Tian heard Ling ran’s extremely confident answer, she no longer hesitated.</p>
<p>Her thoughts were very clear. When it came to medical skills, Ling ran surpassed the family doctors in the cabin. When it came to trust, Ling ran was at least not inferior to the few family members in the conference call, then, after Ling ran made a serious suggestion for the second time, mother Tian did not hesitate anymore.</p>
<p>Tian Qi trusted Ling ran even more. When she saw this, she immediately said, “I think that the medical suggestion should first be based on Doctor Ling’s opinion. I hope that all the departments can work together to ensure that the hospitals and operating theaters in Shanghai…”</p>
<p>Over the phone, mother Tian continued, “If anyone has any problems, look for me or Old Huang immediately. You can also look for Tian Qi. We’ll confirm it again in twenty minutes. “Also, just as Doctor Ling said, everyone can continue to invite the team of doctors mentioned just now. We can invite them to Shanghai to be backup so that we can be prepared. “Doctor Ling, do you have any other requests?”</p>
<p>“Please get the hospitals in Shanghai to arrange for assistant doctors and surgical nurses. They must have a certain level of experience. Prepare all kinds of consumables, especially the artificial blood vessels to be replaced. Prepare a few more types. “Also, my team should be on their way. They’re using the plane of the Medical Transportation Company…” as Ling ran spoke, he looked at Tian Qi.</p>
<p>Tian Qi said, “I’ll go and confirm it again…”</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded. He did not say anything else. He sat beside her and took out an IPAD. He started to read it himself, and soon, he became engrossed in it.</p>
<p>After Tian Qi finished a conference call, she made another call to ensure that the various parts of the conference call went smoothly. This was not a normal time. She could order her team to quietly wait for the results. She could not allow anyone to make mistakes or delay the results.</p>
<p>After another round of confirmation was completed, Tian Qi looked back at Ling ran and immediately felt at ease.</p>
<p>She sat beside Ling ran rather tiredly and leaned against his shoulder, wanting to find some support.</p>
<p>At the same time, Tian Qi also looked at Ling ran’s IPAD very naturally. She was curious about the content he was reading at the moment.</p>
<p>The brightness of the IPAD was very high, and Ling ran did not intend to hide it. Tian Qi looked over and easily found the name of the PDF file in the upper left corner: “Surgical procedures for the improvement of acute aortic dissection.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1440: Young</p>
<p>“Director Kang, let’s go.” The transporters in orange uniforms came directly to the corridor outside the surgery, and they led director Kang, who had just put on his clothes, away quickly.</p>
<p>“We can make it, we can make it…” director Kang panted as he walked, and he was slightly proud of himself.</p>
<p>It was easy for doctors to feel a sense of need when they were dragged along by the transporters in conspicuous uniforms. Director Kang could imagine he Yuanzheng’s expression of envy, jealousy, disdain, and dissatisfaction when he received the news.</p>
<p>Of course, Doctor Ling’s call was also very important. Otherwise, it would be too disgraceful for a dignified director of the cardiology department to be ordered around by ordinary people.</p>
<p>After taking the helicopter and transferring to the business jet, director Kang’s mood gradually became tense.</p>
<p>“What’s the patient’s current condition?” Department director Kang looked down and frowned slightly.</p>
<p>“The patient’s initial diagnosis is an aortic dissection. He’ll arrive at the hospital 30 minutes earlier than us.” Lu Wenbin and Ma Yanlin followed him on the business plane, and they tried their best to communicate with each other. They knew that their chances of performing surgery were relatively low, but they were already used to doing auxiliary work that was deeply rooted in their bones.</p>
<p>As the first surgeon in Yun Hua Hospital’s Department of Cardiology, Department director Kang was not ranked in the country, but he was the chief surgeon. If he performed surgery on someone, logically speaking, he would be an amazing assistant that normal teams could not afford.</p>
<p>When he heard that the patient had an aortic dissection, department director Kang calmed down a little, he said, “Although it’s dangerous, if we send him to the hospital so quickly, there should be a 70 to 80 percent chance of survival. If doctor Ling does it… HMM… we arrive 30 minutes later than the patient? Who will be Doctor Ling’s assistant?”</p>
<p>“He’s a doctor from the local hospital in Shanghai. He’s from the Department of cardiac surgery in Dongguang Hospital.” Lu Wenbin raised his head and looked at department director Kang’s expression intentionally. He then smiled and said, “What else can he do?”</p>
<p>“Dongguang’s Department of cardiac surgery… is just so-so.” Department director Kang curled his lips. “It’s not the best.”</p>
<p>“Doctor Ling only wants the operating theater,” Lu Wenbin said.</p>
<p>Ma Yanlin added, “There’s also an assistant.”</p>
<p>“The tacit understanding between Doctor Ling and I is not something that Dongguang’s skills can make up for.” Department director Kang adjusted his mood and puffed up his chest.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin and Ma Yanlin both showed understanding smiles.</p>
<p>“We’re about to land.” A robust flight attendant came over to inform them and brought Lu Wenbin a drink. He said softly, “I saw you do push-ups just now, so I prepared some protein powder for you…”</p>
<p>“Okay, thank you.” Lu Wenbin smiled at the people on both sides. He stretched out his arm, which was thicker than a circle, and drank up the protein powder in one gulp.</p>
<p>Ma Yanlin revealed an unenvious expression. He stood up and went to the bar counter in front of him. He asked the pretty flight attendant for a cup of drink and drank it in one gulp. Then, he sat down nearby and fastened his seatbelt.</p>
<p>The business plane landed at the airport at a speed that far exceeded that of a medium-sized or large-sized plane.</p>
<p>Director Kang and the others got off the plane as fast as they could. When they transferred to the helicopter and took off, they happened to see another business plane landing and immediately activated its reverse thrust. It only glided for a very short distance, then, people waiting by the runway rushed up.</p>
<p>“Does it look like it’s with us?” Lu Wenbin often went out for freelance surgeries. He felt that it looked like it when he saw that plane. As he spoke, he picked up his phone and directly called the contact person of the medical transportation company.</p>
<p>After a while, the call came back. Lu Wenbin hummed and put down his phone. He looked at department director Kang and Ma Yanlin with a strange expression and said, “You’ll definitely not be able to guess who it is.”</p>
<p>“Is he too awesome or too stupid?” Ma Yanlin’s emotions were the most stable. If Lu Wenbin had an extremely low probability of getting a third assistant or something like that, Ma Yanlin was considered to have a very low probability. He did not have to worry about gains and losses, naturally, his emotions were stable.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin humphed twice. “Speaking of which, he’s pretty awesome.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“Do you remember Wei Jiayou? He’s a very arrogant heart surgeon who looks a little shady and extremely tall. He even had a hepatectomy later on. He looks like he wants to compete with Doctor Ling.” Lu Wenbin clicked his tongue, he played with his phone in his hand and said, “He came here together with academician DI’s team.”</p>
<p>“Is it academician DI’s team or academician DI’s team?” Department director Kang immediately asked.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin pursed his lips. “Of course, academician DI’s team is included.”</p>
<p>“Hiss.” Department director Kang Sucked in a breath of cold air. It was as if an old hamster had seen a ferris wheel, and his legs instinctively went soft.</p>
<p>When a doctor reached the level of an academician, no matter which department they were from, they would be super awesome. When it came to academicians of the same rank, department director Kang seemed to have no resistance at all.</p>
<p>“They should also be the medical team that the Tian family hired,” Ma Yanlin casually guessed.</p>
<p>“Only the Tian family can hire them.” Department director Kang’s pupils were slightly dilated. “If that’s the case, I don’t know if we should let Doctor Ling do it or wait for them to do it.”</p>
<p>“They’re a little slower than us. They’ll arrive at the hospital forty minutes later. In addition, they’ll need time to wash their hands and change their clothes…”</p>
<p>“Just enough time to complete the cardiopulmonary bypass,” department director Kang interrupted Lu Wenbin.</p>
<p>“If the Tian family knows what they’re doing, they’ll definitely get Doctor Ling to do it.” Lu Wenbin appeared to be very knowledgeable.</p>
<p>“Why?” Department director Kang asked in return, then, he said a little irritably, “If they can get academician di, they’ll also get the awesome team from abroad. For example, Li huaying from Hong Kong is slightly more famous internationally than academician di. She’s even younger than academician di by more than ten years. Moreover, she’ll fly when she’s paid enough, and she’s willing to go to the emergency department even if she’s given a lot of money…”</p>
<p>“Li Huaying is already on her way,” Lu Wenbin said.</p>
<p>Director Kang could not help but let out an “AH…” sound. He looked at Lu Wenbin with an expression that said, “Why didn’t you say so earlier?”.</p>
<p>“It’s useless. Doctor Ling is the best.” Lu Wenbin said confidently at this moment, “I don’t have a lot of experience in extracardiac surgeries, but based on the surgeries I’ve seen, Doctor Ling’s skills are definitely the best among the best. Li huaying and academician di… think about it. Can these two people’s surgeries really compare to Doctor Ling’s? “Li huaying is a teenager, but he’s already in his late 20s. There’s no need to talk about anything else. His focus is on a completely different level!”</p>
<p>Director Kang could not help but frown. He had been working in the outside world for too long. Speaking of which, when he was young and famous, academician di was already a big shot in the industry. Li huaying was already a representative figure in Southeast Asia. Over the years, he had been actively and passively piling up information, all of this would only deepen his impression of him. And as an insider, he rarely thought about whether academician di was stronger or whether Li huaying was stronger. That would be too much of a layman. The doctors in the heart knew more dimensions and considered more aspects, on the contrary, it was even harder to come to a definite conclusion.</p>
<p>Now, Ling ran was placed in front of these two people, and he suddenly had to choose one of the three. If anyone else had consulted department director Kang, he would definitely have said that either one was good enough. However, when he thought about the Tian family’s strength, department director Kang suddenly hesitated.</p>
<p>“Right now, I can only choose one person to be the chief surgeon. If I were to perform a surgery on you, which one would you choose?” Lu Wenbin’s voice was like a barbell, and it was forcefully inserted.</p>
<p>Department director Kang was momentarily stunned, and he really started to think.</p>
<p>“If your strength is about the same, choose the younger one.” The Doctor Who was also on the helicopter was a doctor from a local medical transportation company in Shanghai. However, he often encountered patients and their families struggling with which hospital to go to, at this moment, he just casually said this sentence.</p>
<p>Director Kang immediately felt that it was extremely reasonable. Then, he gradually became sad.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1441: meeting the son-in-law</p>
<p>The helicopter that Ling ran took landed on the roof of the building. It took a few quick steps before it entered the elevator that went straight to the surgical floor.</p>
<p>The reason why he chose Dongguang Hospital was because it had the foundation to transfer medical treatment. Especially when the new hospital was being built, the first aid before the hospital was considered, this was already better than many of the old hospitals in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The quality of the elevator was also very good. It could accommodate two gurneys, and its operation was stable enough. It was even more enclosed. Standing inside, Ling ran could hear Tian Qi’s thumping heartbeat.</p>
<p>Ling ran took a deep breath and calmed himself down first.</p>
<p>Tian Qi looked up at Ling ran and asked, “Are you nervous too?”</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded slightly. Every surgery was a new challenge, and the development of modern medicine was far from reaching a hundred percent level. On the other hand, the patient this time was his father-in-law. Ling ran had to consider that this was the first time the two of them met.</p>
<p>According to the book, the first meeting between husband and son-in-law should have been something to talk about, but today..</p>
<p>*ding.*</p>
<p>The elevator door opened. At the same time, the system also released a notification that the mission had been completed.</p>
<p>[ mission completed: flying to save the patient. ]</p>
<p>[ mission details: arrive at the operating theater of the hospital before the patient dies. ].</p>
<p>-LSB- mission rewaAdvancednTreasuresChesthest. ].</p>
<p>Ling ran opened the treasure chest without saying a word. As expected, what appeared inside was the one-time skill book that he had read in advance: 100% successful surgery. No matter how difficult the surgery was, as long as there was a theoretical success rate.., there was a 100% chance of success.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. As long as the person is sent here, the surgery will definitely be completed smoothly.” Ling ran gave Tian Qi a piece of reassurance. Then, he nodded at the people in front of the elevator and asked, “Who is department director Wan?”</p>
<p>“Doctor Ling.” Department director Wan of the Department of Cardiology of Dongguang Hospital was a thin middle-aged man who was about 50 years old. He greeted Ling ran politely and amicably and said, “The operating theater is ready. Do you have any requests for your assistant?”</p>
<p>Ling ran had the Tian family on his left hand and academician Zhu on his right hand. He was also a rising star in the department of cardiac surgery in the country. Department director Wan did not have the mood to fight against Ling ran from the very beginning. He only wanted to send Ling ran away in a good manner — no.., ling ran should have accepted him in a bad way.</p>
<p>“Are you willing to be an assistant?” Ling ran asked Department director Wan without any preparation.</p>
<p>From the social etiquette of the hospital, this was a very impolite thing to do, especially when it came to things like being an assistant. It was not easy to directly ask for an assistant unless one had reached a certain level. Otherwise, when everyone got drunk one day.., it is possible to say “Who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who-who -. No credit, no ability, and easy to find fault with.</p>
<p>However, Ling ran himself has never been afraid of this kind of thing, he rarely met with himself to talk about the etiquette of the industry. Just like department director Wan, he actually agreed without much consideration.</p>
<p>“I’ll be your first assistant. If you want to be your second assistant and nurse, do you want to use our people as well?” Department director Wan even lent him the operating theater, so there was actually nothing much to consider. The most important thing now was to complete the surgery smoothly, he knew very well that as long as he could save the patient, he could live a good few days where he could get what he wanted. If there was a problem with the patient, then there would be a big problem.</p>
<p>In comparison, social etiquette was a completely trivial matter. Even if the other party wanted to be particular about it, department director Wan would have an explanation.</p>
<p>“Alright. Let’s enter the operating theater.” Ling ran confirmed his team in the operating theater with just a few words. He then glanced at Tian Qi before he followed department director Wan into the Operating Theater.</p>
<p>Tian Qi’s eyes were wide open. Tears welled up in her eyes, but she did not dare to let them fall. She was afraid of disturbing Ling ran’s mood.</p>
<p>She washed her hands, changed her clothes, and checked all kinds of equipment. When everything was ready, she saw a patient being pushed in.</p>
<p>“Mr. Tian, can you tell me your name?” The nurse grabbed the patient’s foot tag and immediately confirmed it with the patient who was still conscious.</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s me…” father Tian endured the pain and opened his eyes.</p>
<p>“Can you tell me your name?” The nurse asked in a serious and serious manner. The more important the surgery was, the more they were afraid of making mistakes in their rush. The nurses in the audience, who had heard countless negative stories, were also very nervous at that moment.</p>
<p>Father Tian saw Ling ran, who was wearing a mask, at first glance. This made his emotions fluctuate even more. He was a little unwilling to give in so easily to the young nurse, but it only took two seconds. After another bout of pain.., father Tian said slowly, “My name is Tian Guoli.”</p>
<p>“I’m your chief surgeon today, Ling ran.” Ling ran walked over at that moment. He looked at Father Tian’s face and hesitated for half a second before he said the greeting he had prepared beforehand, “Hello, uncle. I’m Ling ran.”</p>
<p>“You… Hello…” Tian Guoli’s lips trembled. He had thought of many ways to meet a son-in-law. There were ways to show off, ways to kill, ways to set rules, ways to knock down mountains and Shake Tigers, ways to be gentle and majestic..</p>
<p>No matter what, he could not use any of them at that moment.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli could only feel tears welling up in his eyes, but he did not dare to let them fall. He was afraid that Ling ran would discover his weakness.</p>
<p>“We are ready to make preoperative preparations.” Ling ran’s voice came from above and brought Tian Guoli back to the real world.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli tore his lips and wanted to say, “Okay.”</p>
<p>At that moment, the nurse from before said loudly again, “I’m going to shave off your chest hair now.”</p>
<p>“HMM?” Tian Guoli’s mind froze again.</p>
<p>His chest hair… his chest hair was so that he could look good when he worked out, and he spent a lot of money to get it… it did not matter whether it was money or not, but the hair follicles used to grow hair were taken from the back of his head..</p>
<p>*Creak Creak…*</p>
<p>The young nurse was too skilled. She could shave faster than Tian Guoli could shed tears.</p>
<p>“Anesthesia…” Tian Guoli heard Ling ran’s voice again. This time, he decided..</p>
<p>Tian Guoli fainted during the process of making the decision.</p>
<p>“Let’s begin.” Ling ran patted the book he just received.</p>
<p>Even though the success rate of his aortic dissection surgery was already very high, he did not need any additional support from the system to complete it smoothly. But now that he had a book to use, Ling ran did not hesitate at all.</p>
<p>He performed a thoracotomy and established extracorporeal circulation.</p>
<p>After the temperature dropped to 30 degrees, ling ran blocked the ascending aorta and perfused the cardioplegia fluid.</p>
<p>Only when all the operations were completed did the real part of the surgery begin.</p>
<p>At that moment, the operating theater was also crowded with spectators.</p>
<p>Academician di from the capital city and his favorite disciple, Wei Jiayou, stood at the front of the crowd. Wei Jiayou’s body emitted a faint smell of ginseng. He looked at Ling ran and the patient on the other side of the glass with a focused expression.</p>
<p>Li huaying from Hong Kong City and his team had just arrived. Under his slightly tired face, there was a serious and surprised expression.</p>
<p>The doctors from Shanghai City were divided into two groups, one on the left and the other on the right. There was a clear distinction between them. Their fame and status were much higher than department director Wan’s of Dongguang Hospital. However, they still only managed to get a supporting role in this surgery.</p>
<p>These people were rarely seen together. Today, they were still quietly watching the surgery without saying a word.</p>
<p>Normally, they would not take such a long time to watch a complete surgery performed by another doctor. At most, they would wait for the person to finish the surgery and pull the progress bar to take a look at the main part of the surgery. However, today, since they were all here, a group of people wanted to see who had the skills to snatch their jobs.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1442: ’I am in a very good condition.’</p>
<p>Ling ran performed the surgery at a leisurely pace.</p>
<p>Department director Wan followed Ling Ran’s steps and followed the operation leisurely.</p>
<p>He could perform major vascular surgery on his own, and he did it quite well. Now, it was even easier for him to just follow Ling ran as an assistant.</p>
<p>Of course, there were also rules for being an assistant. Department director Wan was actually a little unfamiliar with this aspect, but he was still prepared. He was just waiting for Ling ran to speak and give him a hand. As the saying went, when the people in the bridal sedan chair lifted him up, he had already given up the operating theater and became an assistant. It was really nothing to say a few nice words.</p>
<p>Moreover, there were so many people watching the surgery outside these days. Many of them were rare world-class clinicians. If he did not take this opportunity to say a few words from the bottom of his heart and talk about something that left a deep impression on people.., even department director Wan felt that it was a waste, let alone Ling ran, who was the chief surgeon. If it were not for the Tian family spending money and using their credit as an invitation, even if you held a very awesome meeting, you probably would not be able to invite so many big shots. It would be even more impossible to see a rising star perform a surgery.</p>
<p>Department director Wan then waited, waited, and waited. He saw Ling ran peel off the blood vessels step by step, Ling ran make incisions step by step, and Ling ran make sutures step by step..</p>
<p>Department director Wan felt uncomfortable all over.</p>
<p>‘aren’t you going to give a speech on opening the bed?</p>
<p>‘Is it not well-prepared?</p>
<p>‘I don’t know what to say? ‘Let’s draw up an outline in advance. I Can’t waste the opportunity to show my face in front of such a big group of big shots.’.</p>
<p>Department director Wan’s gaze quietly turned to the side of the window.</p>
<p>As expected, all of them were staring at him intently. All of them looked quite serious.</p>
<p>Department director Wan thought about it again, and indeed, he should be serious. Not to mention that Ling ran, who was the one who performed the surgery, had a great reputation. The patients who stayed on the operating table were also the big shots among the big shots. They even performed major surgeries such as aortic dissection. Regardless of whether it was because of external factors or medical factors, such things were not common, it was also because of the medical science itself.</p>
<p>But because of this, it would be a waste not to chat..</p>
<p>“Get Ready,” Ling ran suddenly said.</p>
<p>Department director Wan could not help but straighten his back. He looked at Ling ran in surprise. This opening line..</p>
<p>“Pay attention to your surgical field,” Ling ran reminded him once again. Then, he used a knife to rub it all the way down the blood vessels.</p>
<p>Department director Wan was immediately shocked. This separation… he was indeed still a young man. He did not know how to speak, but he wanted to use his skills to speak. Department director Wan could not help but think of all kinds of young thoughts he had when he was young. At that time.., he had taken the initiative to choose the department of cardiac surgery because he wanted to use technology to shock the world after watching a lot of television dramas. Only when he was older and had encountered many obstacles would he understand that shocking the world was something that could only be achieved by transcending the world. In the medical world, this was practically the exclusive right of the elderly, especially in the department of cardiac surgery, if he did not have twenty to thirty years of experience, he would be the one who would be shocked..</p>
<p>“Stop forceps.” Ling ran gave another order and continued to bury his head in the patient’s chest.</p>
<p>Department director Wan Smiled Secretly. He could not help but give a condescending evaluation in his mind. Although it was a very standard operating technique and was very fast, if there was anything special about it..</p>
<p>Of course, there were also some things that were special about it. First of all, the surgical field was very clear. This was because there was very little bleeding, so it was not like the cardiopulmonary bypass surgery performed by ordinary doctors. The chest cavity was always a mess of blood, and it was an inextricable environment. Just This alone was worthy of Ling ran’s reputation as a celebrity doctor. However, it was reasonable for him to be qualified to perform surgery under the noses of so many big shots.</p>
<p>Secondly, Ling Ran’s judgment was accurate, and his operation was not sloppy at all. This was something department director Wan had observed very well. This meant that Ling ran was able to adjust the rhythm of his surgery at any time according to the patient’s condition. There were no set rules, compared to doctors who could only operate step by step, this was something that many people could not learn in their entire lives. However, it was still natural for Ling ran to be able to do things to such a degree in front of so many big shots.</p>
<p>Third, Ling ran’s separation was extremely neat and neat. When performing surgeries around the heart, the density of the blood vessels and nerves was unquestionable. Sometimes, if the thickness of the skin of a radish was pulled, the blood vessels in the surrounding would be cut off. For the weaker doctors.., each separation operation was extremely dangerous, and they needed to pay extra attention to it. They even needed to hold their breath and stare at it before they could perform the operation. But in Ling ran’s case, he could really lift a heavy weight as if it were a light weight. This..</p>
<p>If this was something that could be seen frequently, it might be a little unconscionable, but there were so many big shots, and there was always someone who could do it..</p>
<p>Department director Wan continued to perform the surgery. As he continued to follow Ling ran, his emotions gradually sublimated.</p>
<p>Because the surgery was entering the most difficult stage, Ling ran’s operation was still so stable that it made people feel calm. As an assistant, department director Wan himself did not even feel the slightest bit of burden.</p>
<p>If it were a junior attending physician, he might even have some wild thoughts in his mind and wonder if his abilities had unknowingly improved.</p>
<p>But who was Department director Wan? He was a department director who had not improved his abilities in the past ten years! How could his abilities improve during the course of a surgery?</p>
<p>Department director Wan’s emotions could not help but go from a solid state to a gaseous state without any turning point.</p>
<p>His expression also became vivid and strange.</p>
<p>Department director Wan could not help but turn his head to look at the monitor. The numbers that represented vital information such as blood oxygen and blood pressure were as steady as an old dog. The curves were monotonous and boring as if they were the work he was doing.</p>
<p>When he thought of this, department director Wang quickly turned his head around. He was indeed not busy being an assistant, but he still had to be focused.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Ling ran did not take the opportunity to reprimand him. He even made some slight changes during the surgery to ensure that department director Wang returned to the rhythm that he was familiar with.</p>
<p>Department director Wan smoothly switched to assistant mode. The shock in his heart — at this moment, department director Wan suddenly felt that it was time for him to express his shock.</p>
<p>If he was the chief surgeon himself, there was no need for him to do so. If it was anyone else who was the chief surgeon outside, department director Wan felt that they might not be able to do what Ling ran did.</p>
<p>The standards of surgery were one thing. Under what circumstances and what standards of surgery were performed, it was another matter entirely.</p>
<p>If a surgeon was compared to a race car driver, performing surgery on different patients was like racing on different tracks. It was possible to run a perfect lap on a certain track, but running a perfect lap on an unfamiliar track was a story from another dimension.</p>
<p>If the surgeon performed a demonstration surgery at a certain international conference, in order to create a super-strong “Demonstration” effect, the Doctor would at least perform all kinds of tests on the patient before the race, and even screen the patient, from there, they would select the most familiar and standard patients to participate in the surgery.</p>
<p>However, the patient at the moment was Ling ran’s own father-in-law, and he was the head of the Tian family. Not to mention that his condition was sudden, even if he knew in advance about the condition of a patient like Tian Guoli, he would still keep it a secret, even if it was a son-in-law-to-be, with department director Wan’s understanding of this family, especially with his identity as a son-in-law-to-be or son-in-law, he would be the one who should not know about the condition of his father-in-law’s body.</p>
<p>However, Ling ran was clearly running perfect laps on an unfamiliar track. There were even signs that he was running faster than the record.</p>
<p>In the early stages when the condition of the track was relatively simple, this situation was not too obvious. However, when the track became unusually complicated and difficult, and Ling ran ran ran so fast and steadily, department director Wan’s mind started to fail to keep up.</p>
<p>Department director Wan could not help but look out of the window again.</p>
<p>Sure enough, the group of cardiologists who specialized in major blood vessels started to whisper to each other.</p>
<p>“Focus,” Ling ran reminded them again.</p>
<p>“OH. Yes,” department director Wan quickly responded and lowered his head.</p>
<p>“Do you need to rest?” Ling ran asked. His team members had already arrived. If department director Wan did not get along with them, he could change people at any time.</p>
<p>Department director Wan only hesitated for half a second before he shook his head without hesitation. “No need. I’m in good condition.”</p>
<p>Ling ran hummed in acknowledgment, and his hands actually started to accelerate slowly.</p>
<p>He also felt that department director Wan’s cooperation had begun to get through the period of getting used to each other, and he could perform the surgery better.</p>
<p>And this scene, in the eyes of department director Wan and the people outside the window, began to become exaggerated.</p>
<p>Ling ran was still using the word ‘racing’to describe it. It was as if he was driving a car with a big bend but did not release the accelerator. It was not impossible, but it was far from being a normal skill.</p>
<p>However, the controls under his hands were extremely beautiful, and the people were even a little fascinated by it.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1443</p>
<p>When Ling ran performed heart surgery, he always tended to be fast-paced.</p>
<p>Especially after he used extracorporeal circulation, the duration of the extracorporeal circulation had a great impact on the prognosis of the patient. If Ling ran wanted to give Tian Qi a lively father who was the same as before the surgery, he had to reduce the surgery time as much as possible.</p>
<p>Fortunately, he did have such conditions.</p>
<p>The skill book that had a 100% success rate was obtained from a high-level treasure chest. If he really followed the blueprint of the successful surgery, it would actually be useless. Ling ran did not use this skill book, but he could guarantee that the surgery would be 99% successful. Even if there was a tendency to fail, he could still use all kinds of means to salvage the situation. Then, once he used this skill book, Ling ran could choose from a wider range of options.</p>
<p>For example, he could challenge some of the actions that he did not dare to challenge in the past, and he could try out some of the techniques that he did not have the strength to try in the past..</p>
<p>There were actually not many techniques that a simple surgeon could master, especially when it came to the same type of surgery. Usually, they would learn by analogy what they were familiar with and what they were good at. They would not be like other industries, they would try out new techniques and new techniques in a bold and decisive manner.</p>
<p>This was because all new things had a price, and the price of being a surgeon was often too heavy to bear.</p>
<p>Ling ran often thought of ways to use cadaver instructors in order to be able to improve some important skills and techniques more safely. He could only improve them with cadaver instructors and then do it with patients, only then could he be relatively safe.</p>
<p>It could be imagined that with the scarcity of cadaver teachers, even if Ling ran used them sparingly, the speed of development of some key skills would not be very fast. However, the situation was completely different now that there was a 100% guarantee on the technical books.</p>
<p>After he confirmed that department director Wan was in a good condition and was familiar with his operating habits, Ling ran picked up a large blood vessel..</p>
<p>“Huh?”Department director Wan subconsciously wanted to stop Ling ran, but he soon realized that he was an assistant. Moreover, was the person in front of him really someone he could question?</p>
<p>Department director Wan subconsciously cooperated with Ling Ran’s operation while he was thinking nervously. The second assistant beside him could not help but swallow his saliva. As a senior attending physician in Dongguang Hospital, he had his own understanding of large blood vessel surgery, but his understanding clearly did not expect Ling ran to perform this operation.</p>
<p>“Focus.”Ling ran was not afraid of his own mistakes, but he was still very vigilant against the assistants’operation. While his movements were quick, he also paid attention to the movements of the first and second assistants.</p>
<p>Department director Wan immediately understood Ling ran’s expression. He believed that the big shots on the other side of the window must have also understood it. wasn’t this the expression he would have when he watched the students being sent to the operating table?</p>
<p>For a few seconds, Department associate director Wan felt that he had been insulted!</p>
<p>Ling ran scooped up the ascending aorta at the far end of the operating table with his hand again. He did everything with ease, and his movements were so smooth that he looked like a butcher in a market.</p>
<p>When Department associate director Wan saw Ling Ran’s actions, his limbs immediately went limp, and his expression became soft again.</p>
<p>When big shots did things, they could do whatever they wanted. There was no need for him to say anything.</p>
<p>Thus, the surgery continued smoothly, orderly, steadily, and without a single ripple.</p>
<p>If one were to look at it from the perspective of an outsider, the surgery process would only seem ordinary, like an assembly line in a workshop.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, in the viewing room that was separated by a window, the big shots could not help but exclaim in admiration.</p>
<p>“Tsk…”</p>
<p>“TSK TSK…”</p>
<p>“TSK TSK TSK…”</p>
<p>As the big shots, their remaining reserve allowed them to control the speed of their speech. They would not make a sound unless they were particularly surprised.</p>
<p>In comparison, Zuo Cidian was the one who understood the situation the most. His skill level was too weak, so he could not understand the operation inside at all. However, Zuo Cidian could clearly hear the jealousy, surprise, admiration, and helplessness in the Big Shots’voices.</p>
<p>He secretly recorded the sound effects of the scene, but he was scratching his ears and cheeks, not knowing how to send it out.</p>
<p>It did not seem like a big shot learning how to sing like a bird.</p>
<p>* Buzz Buzz Buzz… *</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian’s phone vibrated softly again.</p>
<p>He picked it up and looked at it. As expected, it was another call from Tian Qi.</p>
<p>“The surgery is still ongoing. It went very smoothly.”Zuo Cidian pressed the answer button and spoke directly.</p>
<p>Tian Qi was anxious. In the current situation, they could not enter the visiting room to take a look, and it was not convenient for them to find other doctors to supervise and examine Ling ran. Hence, they could only make phone calls over and over again.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian was naturally very happy to receive the call. Usually, he would not have such a good opportunity to show his goodwill to Miss Tian Qi. Zuo Cidian was very clear now that Ling ran could decide a part of whether his future was good or not, but most of it was up to Miss Tian Qi to decide, especially the part that was closer to the upper limit. Whether or not he could satisfy Miss Tian Qi was definitely the most important indicator.</p>
<p>On the other end of the phone, Tian Qi turned on the speakerphone. In fact, she did not know what to say. She could only repeat, “It’s good that everything went smoothly. There shouldn’t be any danger, right?”</p>
<p>“Today and tomorrow are still relatively dangerous,”Zuo Cidian said in a low voice. “Right now, the focus is still on the surgery… you don’t have to worry too much…”</p>
<p>Tian Qi listened to Zuo Cidian’s explanation for a long time before she hung up the phone with a grunt. In fact, she had a lot of sources of information, but she still needed some comfort from “Insiders,”or comfort from her mother and others.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian held the slightly hot phone and sighed in relief.</p>
<p>Li Yinghua, who was from Hong Kong City, smiled and asked, “Family members?”</p>
<p>Zuo cidian chuckled but did not answer. Instead, he said politely, “We also watched the video of you performing the surgery before.”</p>
<p>Li Yinghua was stunned for a moment before he smiled. “I’m ashamed… HMM, you don’t have to watch Doctor Ling’s words anymore. His operation today and this video of him will be learned by everyone later.”</p>
<p>When Li Yinghua said the last sentence, he looked around.</p>
<p>The few big shots nodded solemnly.</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian could not help but heave a sigh of relief when he saw this. To be honest, he had performed the surgery in front of so many big shots, and it was in the midst of competition. If it were him, his movements would have become distorted and the hair on his chest would have fallen off.</p>
<p>“The cardiopulmonary bypass is over.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian and the others did not remain silent for too long. The surgery had already progressed to the final stage.</p>
<p>There was not much sense of ritual. The anesthetist looked at the blood gas analysis report and injected some sodium nitroprusside and furosemide. Then, he began to reduce the amount of blood stored in the artificial heart and lung machine. His expression was also relaxed. Because the surgery was carried out for an unusually short period of time and there were no accidents such as atrial fibrillation, the amount of blood lost during the surgery was terrifyingly low. For a professional high-level anesthetist.., the operation today was simply child’s play.</p>
<p>“Doctor Ling, do you want me to close your chest?”Department director Wan took the initiative to bring it up.</p>
<p>To him, even though Ling ran did not say anything, the pressure of the surgery overflowed was already very great. He did not want to wait for Ling ran to order him to do the work of an assistant, so he simply took the initiative to make himself look better.</p>
<p>However, Ling ran did not hesitate to shake his head and said, “I’ll finish it myself.”</p>
<p>The heart surgery, the drainage tube placed in the later stage, and so on were also quite particular. Of course, department director Wan’s level would definitely not make a mistake, but Ling ran took advantage of the skill book and felt that he should not let go.</p>
<p>On the other hand, department director Wan’s self-cultivation had greatly improved after performing a surgery. He was not angry even if he was rejected, he said with a smile, “That’s true. Your… patient likes to work out and even has chest hair implants. You have to be more particular about suturing.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1443 Warmth and anger</p>
<p>Weekend.</p>
<p>The Tian family gathered together in the general ward to welcome Tian Guoli, who was transferred from the Intensive Care Unit.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli lay on the operating bed. His face was pale, but his mood was okay. His recovery speed was faster than all the family doctors had expected. The ICU doctors also handled the pain well. Although it was still not comfortable, overall, Tian Guoli’s mood was still positive.</p>
<p>Especially after seeing his wife and daughter, Tian Guoli’s mood was even better.</p>
<p>“I’m fine.”When Tian Guoli saw so many people, the unbearable discomfort in his body actually disappeared quite a bit. He subconsciously wanted to reveal a bit of dignity on his face.</p>
<p>Many people unconsciously became serious. This was a habit that had been formed over many years.</p>
<p>Mother Tian smiled and glanced at her husband, saying, “Don’t keep a straight face and don’t worry about the matters at home. You have to rest well and take care of your body…”</p>
<p>After letting the others say a few more words, she sent everyone out of the door. Then, she saw a few doctors enter the door.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli also felt a little drowsy. He forced himself to be awake and asked, “When can I work?”</p>
<p>As the doctors of Dongguang Hospital entered, there was a family doctor of the Tian family. He smiled as expected and comforted him, “We’ll first take a look at the specific recovery situation before we can come to a more accurate conclusion.”</p>
<p>“Now…”Tian Guoli obviously did not want to hear him say this.</p>
<p>The family doctor smiled again and continued Tian Guoli’s words. “Now, we will first examine your urine bag and wound. If there are no problems…”</p>
<p>When Tian Guoli heard the word “Urine bag”, he gave up struggling. Perhaps he was struggling too much, so he simply fell into a deep sleep.</p>
<p>At night.</p>
<p>Mother Tian hosted a banquet to entertain Ling ran and the others.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this was already the seventh time in the past few days that the Tian family hosted a banquet to entertain Ling ran and the others.</p>
<p>In order to take care of Comrade Tian Guoli, Ling ran would take a helicopter and a private jet arranged by the Tian family to and from Shanghai every day after Yun Hua Hospital’s surgery. It was a three-hour round trip, it made mother Tian feel very bad. Every time she came over, she would naturally receive him continuously.</p>
<p>Today, she also arranged for a 30-kilogram big eastern star grouper to be fished by the sea. Other than the traditional steamed and braised pork, she also used the chopped eastern star grouper to make dumplings.</p>
<p>After Mother Tian waited for Ling ran to taste the dumplings, she said with a smile, “Today’s dumplings were personally made by Little Qi. Are they delicious?”</p>
<p>“They’re very delicious,”Ling ran answered truthfully. The filling of the eastern star spot was extremely delicious. The very thin dumpling skin and ingredients further increased its freshness,</p>
<p>tian Qi smiled so much that the corners of her eyes flew up. For a time, mother Tian was filled with emotion.</p>
<p>Her daughter was already smiling so much. What else could she do.</p>
<p>Of course, Ling ran was indeed handsome, and his medical skills were even more brilliant..</p>
<p>When mother Tian thought of this, she raised her glass and took a sip of wine, then, she said to Ling ran, “Tian Qi’s father was transferred to a normal ward today. He walked for a while in the afternoon… when her father recovers, we’ll go and visit your parents together.”</p>
<p>Tian Qi was originally smiling as she listened to Ling ran’s words, but at that moment, she suddenly felt a little shy.</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded without hesitation. The surgery he performed was monitored the entire time, so it was only natural for him to go to this extent. When Tian Qi’s father recovered, it seemed very normal for him to meet his parents again.</p>
<p>“I also considered meeting your parents alone, but this doesn’t seem very formal,”mother Tian explained on purpose. When she saw that Ling ran was not dissatisfied, she could not help but sigh in relief.</p>
<p>At that moment, she felt that Ling ran’s personality was really good.</p>
<p>Perhaps as an ordinary person, Ling ran’s personality was not ordinary, but he was really too compatible with Tian Qi. If it were any other boy, mother Tian would still have to worry about whether the other party was faking it or whether he would “Wake up”or “Correct his past mistakes”after a few years. However, based on her understanding of Ling ran.., ling ran really would not hide his dissatisfaction in his heart.</p>
<p>If he was dissatisfied with something, he would say it on the spot, and this method was really rare for mother Tian to be relaxed.</p>
<p>The dinner was delicious, and the atmosphere was harmonious. Mother Tian even drank a little more before she brought Ling ran and the others to the ward to visit Tian Guoli.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli slept quite peacefully in the special needs ward.</p>
<p>Mother Tian walked in quietly. She was still a little hesitant about whether she should wake her husband up.</p>
<p>At that moment, Ling ran lifted his chin in a familiar manner.</p>
<p>Ma Yanlin, who was traveling with him, immediately knocked on the door as if it was a reflex. he shouted, “I’m going to do a ward round…”</p>
<p>Tian Guoli was immediately startled awake, and he was a little angry. He had never met such a rash ward round doctor before.</p>
<p>However, before he could speak, Ling ran walked in with a smile that was in line with society’s expectations.</p>
<p>“Let’s do a physical examination.”Ling ran had always treated patients equally. This time was no exception. After he explained, he lifted the thin blanket that Tian Guoli was covering.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli wanted to resist, but he needed all the strength in his body to move the urinary catheter. His movements could not keep up with the speed of his thoughts.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the blink of an eye, Tian Guoli’s abdomen fell into Ling ran’s palm.</p>
<p>It was warm, but it was also infuriating!</p>
<p>“Your wound has recovered well.”Ling ran did a simple check before he took the report from the foot of the bed and read it carefully. He then said, “Starting from Tomorrow, you’ll need to start your rehabilitation…”</p>
<p>Tian Guoli held his breath and said with difficulty, “How long will it take… before you can leave the hospital to work?”</p>
<p>“At least a week before you can leave the hospital. If you want to work at a low-intensity level, you’ll need another two weeks or so…”Ling ran explained in detail.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli listened with a puzzled expression. If the two of them were in a different place, for example, on the golf course that he liked, and he held a golf club in his hand, he could say that he wanted to use a deep tone to discuss some profound questions with Ling ran, but.., at that moment, he was lying on the hospital bed and listening to Ling ran say professional words. He could not talk about the profound and profound.</p>
<p>“Rehabilitation is very important. You must persevere,”Ling ran emphasized.</p>
<p>At that moment, mother Tian also came forward and said, “That’s right. You must do your rehabilitation well and listen to the Doctor’s words.”</p>
<p>“I’m listening,”Tian Guoli mumbled. Then, he looked at Tian Qi. His expression became much warmer. He said in a low voice, “Little Qi, don’t worry. Daddy is fine.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”Tian Qi nodded heavily. She subconsciously held Ling ran’s arm and said, “As long as you listen to Ling ran, you’ll be fine very soon. Don’t worry, Daddy.”</p>
<p>Tian Guoli’s little heart, which had been sutured by Ling ran, trembled a little. In the end, it continued to beat steadily.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 1444 - END</p>
<p>After Ling ran’s surgery and under the care of the family doctor, Tian Guoli’s body recovered extremely quickly.</p>
<p>His foundation was already very good to begin with. He exercised and massaged every day. Even though he performed major surgeries that required cardiopulmonary bypass, with Ling ran’s technique and the production of a high-level treasure chest, it could not be said that there were no side effects, however, the prognosis was really beyond the understanding of many people in the medical world.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli was also quite surprised when he walked as usual. Even with his understanding of the people around him, those who had undergone heart surgery had never had such an easy time.</p>
<p>He walked a hundred steps with his cane and arrived at the garden outside the bedroom. He looked at the flourishing hanging orchids and the plump, thick-stalked green willows. Tian Guoli let out a sigh of relief, and a smile could not help but appear on his face.</p>
<p>“It’s better to walk on your own.”Mother Tian followed behind him for a while, and she also felt at ease, she then said, “We have to be more careful. You have to be careful when you exercise and recover. Don’t Hurt Yourself, and don’t be too excited! Also, eat a lighter diet…”</p>
<p>“I’m excited too…”as Tian Guoli spoke, his voice became a little louder, and he lowered his voice before he shook his head again, he said, “Later, send the few pieces of beef that I saved to Ling ran. Send another team of cooks over.”</p>
<p>“Your daughter has already been sent over,”mother Tian said calmly.</p>
<p>Tian Guoli:”…”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Yun Hua Hospital.</p>
<p>The emergency department had a festive atmosphere.</p>
<p>Today, Yu Yuan was actually wearing a skirt. Even though she was wearing a skirt under her white coat, the hem of her skirt could still be seen.</p>
<p>The pale pink skirt added to her liveliness and cuteness. There was even a faint smell of ginseng on her body.</p>
<p>Ma Yanlin was also wearing a suit and tie today. The clothes his wife bought for him were branded. He was rich in the Department of Urology. Speaking of which, he was also the envy of Yun Hua Hospital. Other people were worried that they would have to buy bags for their wives again. Only he received gifts from his wife every day. Doctor Zhou only soaked in goji berries because it was a little physically demanding. Other than goji berries, there were also deer antler and angelica root in his thermos cup. He practiced Western medicine and took Chinese medicine.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin liked to wear a tight white vest under his white coat. When he met the new young nurse, he would even roll up the sleeves of his white coat, revealing his muscular arms.</p>
<p>But it was useless. He was the only doctor in the department who was still single.</p>
<p>When the hospital had a happy event, the pharmaceutical sales representative would come and support him. Huang Maoshi was like a successful eunuch. His hair was oily, and his face was shiny. He rushed over and shouted at Ling ran, “Doctor Ling, Congratulations on your promotion. Oh My, I’m going to call you department director Ling Now.”</p>
<p>Huang Maoshi actually often called Ling ran department director, but today, he had to specifically shout it out loud.</p>
<p>Ling ran nodded slightly.</p>
<p>The inconspicuous tu yuan suddenly said, “You can also call him Professor Ling.”</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin and Ma Yanlin lowered their heads and looked at Tu Yuan at the same time. ‘you always suck up to people in the right way.’.</p>
<p>“Yun University has hired someone? Congratulations, Congratulations. This is double happiness.”Huang Maoshi immediately reacted. Nowadays, the affiliated hospitals were all under the university. Many times, this was what they wanted. To some doctors, a professor was a title that was a little more high-end than a director.</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin quickly said, “Of course. Our department director Ling could have made an exception long ago.”</p>
<p>Ma Yanlin did not show any signs of weakness. “Director Wu promised me before. This is a one-time deal. Professor Ling deserves it.”</p>
<p>Zuo Cidian had already praised him for this. Right now, he looked like he was doing his job honestly.</p>
<p>Department director Huo was very pleased with himself. The curly hair on his body was almost standing on end. He looked at Ling ran lovingly.</p>
<p>The head nurse in the department looked relieved, and the young nurse was also full of smiles.</p>
<p>Only Ling ran, who was the patient, was still the same as before.</p>
<p>He was not very concerned about these things. He only confirmed with Huang Maoshi about the supplies and medicine he needed recently before he went to perform the surgery on his own.</p>
<p>After performing three surgeries in one go, Ling ran finally felt that he did not waste the day. When he came out of the operating theater, he saw that there were even more pharmaceutical sales representatives and doctors waiting at the door.</p>
<p>“Professor Ling, Congratulations.”</p>
<p>“Department Director Ling, Congratulations!”</p>
<p>People from all over the place greeted him, and they rushed to show their faces.</p>
<p>Nowadays, being a department director in a hospital was like being an examinee. As long as he did not seek death, he would usually be able to retire peacefully. And with Ling ran’s age, if he did not leave Yun Hua Hospital.., he would be able to send all the current department directors and Associate Department directors away. Even if he did not consider any public factors, Ling ran, who was promoted to chief physician, would also mean a long-term, lifelong relationship as a colleague.</p>
<p>The pharmaceutical sales representatives were even more excited. Those who had muscles used their muscles, those who had throats used their throats, and those who had long legs used their long legs.</p>
<p>When more people came, Zuo Cidian had people decorate the large lounge to make it into a cold dinner party. A small amount of food was provided, and a small amount of drinks were provided. This made those who said too many compliments.., there was a place for people to rest and recover.</p>
<p>Ling ran maintained his smile and stood in the middle of the lounge. No matter what everyone said, he only responded with a handsome expression.</p>
<p>He did not really like the scene of people coming and going. However, he often encountered similar situations, so he just needed to pose like his mother had done before.</p>
<p>A helicopter flew in from the distance outside the window.</p>
<p>The smile on Ling Ran’s face was slightly prominent. Tian Qi had arrived.</p>
<p>*bang.*.</p>
<p>*Bang Bang Bang.*.</p>
<p>A few crisp sounds came from outside the window. A doctor by the side took the opportunity to look over and immediately shouted, “Aiya, it’s not a medical disturbance. It’s actually a patient who sent a brocade flag.”</p>
<p>As a doctor, when it came to his favorite gift, the Brocade flag was in the top three. A group of people immediately rushed over out of curiosity.</p>
<p>There were actually twenty bodyguards escorting the Brocade banner downstairs.</p>
<p>It was a big brocade banner with a red face, golden edges, and golden words.</p>
<p>It was a golden rod.</p>
<p>It was all pure gold, 999.</p>
<p>The Brocade banner needed two people to carry it.</p>
<p>There was no shortage of people when there was a commotion. There were even more people in the hospital.</p>
<p>The patients with broken legs carried their cast legs downstairs to watch the commotion.</p>
<p>“What a bright brocade banner.”</p>
<p>“Have you heard? It’s said that a doctor saved a rich man. The rich man wants to marry his daughter to him.”</p>
<p>“It’s true. The rich man’s daughter comes here by helicopter every day.”</p>
<p>“It’s Doctor Ling. I heard that Doctor Ling was promoted to department director today.”</p>
<p>While everyone was gossiping, Tian Qi also came to Ling ran’s side.</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Congratulations.”Tian Qi smiled and said, “Daddy came over and said that he wanted to thank you.”</p>
<p>Then, Tian Qi led Ling ran and the others to shift positions.</p>
<p>Department director Huo also followed happily, and everyone followed. The publicity department also stood up. They took photos, posed for photos, and took photos with drones… it was very important to accept the banner.</p>
<p>When they arrived, Ling ran saw Tian Liguo. It was the first time he saw him wearing clothes and standing up. He did not recognize him, but he looked very imposing.</p>
<p>Two rows of large words were written on the golden banner:</p>
<p>‘The Doctor is benevolent.’</p>
<p>‘The Great Doctor is Ling ran.’</p>
<p>The small words were embroidered beside the banner. ‘Tian Liguo gave it to me.’.</p>
<p>“The banner was given to me by my father. I’ve also prepared a gift for you.”</p>
<p>Tian Qi picked up the phone and pressed five long buttons.</p>
<p>Next to the Emergency Medical Center building, a black cloth was removed from the large square.</p>
<p>Under the sunlight, a brightly colored truck appeared.</p>
<p>The front of the truck was very powerful. It was square and square, and it was bigger than an ordinary car. It was like the big nose of a truck. It was placed right in front of the truck. There were three chrome-plated strips on the front of the truck, and they complemented the burning red paint, it was very textured. Three exhaust pipes that looked like chimneys stood straight on the roof of the truck. They looked very strong..</p>
<p>Ling ran did not even need Tian Qi to introduce them. He recognized the original model at a glance. He could not help but say, “Optimus Prime.”</p>
<p>Tian Qi explained, “This is the Peter Bilt 389. It’s a very famous model. You can drag all kinds of trailers at the back. You can customize the trailers that you like for medical purposes, or you can use them for traveling purposes…”</p>
<p>“The Optimus Prime in Transformers is just like…”before Tian Qi could finish her sentence, she felt that she was being hugged by Ling ran. She was instantly speechless and leaned gently against Ling ran.</p>
<p>A young man and woman were hugging in front of the transformer car.</p>
<p>Department director Huo: “My Son is finally married.”He touched the corners of his eyes.</p>
<p>Ma yanlin: “You’ll suffer.”</p>
<p>Lu Wenbin: “Doctor Ling already has a partner, but I’m still single despite being so handsome.”</p>
<p>Yu Yuan: I’m behind the wheel, don’t squeeze me..</p>
