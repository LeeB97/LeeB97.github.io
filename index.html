<p>Cha Jun Sung was calculating the coordinates to put the Universe Eye up, when the cemetery came into the battle suit’s view.</p>
<p>[According to blood analyses, the last one was created 2 days ago.]</p>
<p>Grave?</p>
<p>They are common in reality.</p>
<p>When Lifers die here, their colleagues do bury them sometimes. That is not what Cha Jun Sung is wondering about.</p>
<p>On top of each grave is what looks like each Lifer’s belongings like a souvenir. They are items like battle suits and vibrating weapons.</p>
<p>If they had died at the same time, the blood analyses would have showed them to be the same or similar.</p>
<p>But they are all different. Assuming the number of dead are about 6 forces, he can only think that someone is creating these on purpose.</p>
<p>How could Lifers be burying each other at different times in the same place?</p>
<p>It is a phenomenon that Cha Jun Sung cannot understand.</p>
<p>Did a full raid of level C Lifers stay in Austin and gather their dead colleagues in one place? This actually is not impossible.</p>
<p>It is a guess, 6 forces is 600 people. Whether they completed the mission or not, it would have been best to return to reality if they had suffered this much damage.</p>
<p>According to blood analyses, the oldest grave is from 1 month and the newest is 2 days. It does not make sense that Lifers are hunting long term in Austin. They could have been annihilated, but he cannot think that because who would have buried them if they had all been killed?</p>
<p>It would have just been a field of corpses.</p>
<p>“It’s weird. It does look like a human did it from the handiwork.”</p>
<p>The graves have formal assortment.</p>
<p>There is no way a mutant did this. He could run into the Lifer who did it if he is lucky. There is always bound to be an eccentric somewhere. They could have chosen this place because they do not like reality. He wants to meet whoever it is as long as it is not someone with sinister intentions.</p>
<p>Though there is nothing he can do if that person went back to reality in the last 2 days.</p>
<p>“Odin, put it up.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung sent his 6th Universe Eye up, here in Austin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was sleeping in a hotel room that was not in business now. Since he has become superhuman, he only needs to sleep for 1 hour a day and could go for weeks without sleep if he really wanted to. Sleep is not a necessity.</p>
<p>No matter how much energy he has, what is bothersome is bothersome. He isn’t pressed for time and is just annoyed with the search for Odelia, so he is relaxing.</p>
<p>He looks like he is defenseless, but his senses make it so that he can react and attack at any time if he feels something going on near him.</p>
<p>It is just that Odin does not need anything like sleep because he is artificial intelligence, but he minimizes battle suit functions and watches all of the footage provided by the 6 Universe Eyes. It is possible for Odin because he is a machine.</p>
<p>[What is that?]</p>
<p>The Universe Eye in Dallas picked up something strange. Odin watched it with interest and then expanded the video.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>Something is moving at a fast speed. It is not inside Dallas. It is at the end of a 100km radius, a video being filmed on the far lower side.</p>
<p>[What! Narsiel! Vanessa!]</p>
<p>Odin identifies the moving creatures and gasps.</p>
<p>Evil Queen’s 1-st and 2nd daughters are crossing from Dallas to Houston. Odin quickly calculates their route. The Universe Eye formulates their movement and marks it on a map. The calculation is not 100% accurate, but the Universe Eye can estimate it up to a point.</p>
<p>[They’re coming here.]</p>
<p>There is no way of knowing whether their destination is Austin or if they will just be passing by, but it is definitely one or the other. There is plenty of time to prepare since they are still far away.</p>
<p>But with that speed, Cha Jun Sung needs to decide on his direction within a day.</p>
<p>[What if they are coming here and not just passing by? Odelia’s here!]</p>
<p>Odin is not human. He is artificial intelligence. He quickly derives the case with the highest probability. Though of course there are always errors.</p>
<p>[Odin.]</p>
<p>[Code name Odin, responding.]</p>
<p>The artificial intelligence reacts on its own. It is sudden contact from the superiors.</p>
<p>[Hold on reporting.]</p>
<p>[Are you telling me to hide those mutants’ movements from Cha Jun Sung?]</p>
<p>[Yes. Odelia is in Austin. There are 3 level 8-s if Narsiel and Vanessa arrive. Put them against Cha Jun Sung intact.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is a level A Lifer.</p>
<p>He is a Pioneer, but he has the combat ability of a level S Lifer or Perfection because of the card. He has achieved it a few years earlier than expected.</p>
<p>They want to see how he does against a level 9, but that is currently impossible. This is a good chance to test a level S Lifer’s combat ability against 3 level 8-s.</p>
<p>[Impossible! The Universe Eyes are Cha Jun Sung’s personal possessions. If they pick something up, I have a duty to report it whatever it is.]</p>
<p>Odin rejects the superior’s order. He might have accepted albeit reluctantly if Narsiel and Vanessa had been mutants on the same level as Odelia.</p>
<p>It would be a bit of a difficult fight, but there would be a high probability of Cha Jun Sung’s victory.</p>
<p>But they are at different levels. Narsiel is strong, but Two Faced Vanessa is evaluated as being at the same level as Red Eye.</p>
<p>On top of that, there are rumors of a Life Mission investigation that says that combat ability is not from all of her power. That is how much there is hidden.</p>
<p>If 3 of them attack, Cha Jun Sung would have entered a solo mission with a light heart and then be stuck in a life threatening situation.</p>
<p>[If you refuse to obey, I will use my authority to force the program.]</p>
<p>[According to Life Mission rules, I have justification to refuse the force.]</p>
<p>There is the sound of teeth grinding. If this were artificial intelligence, there is no way it would get so agitated. A person is talking to Odin – one of the developers.</p>
<p>[I am sorry. If you have nothing else to say, I will end the connection.]</p>
<p>Odin ended the call with his superior as he wanted. A subordinate needs to obey a senior, but the subordinate can refuse if the senior crosses the line.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung?]</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung opens his eyes.</p>
<p>He had not heard Odin’s conversation with his superior because it was done inside the system.</p>
<p>[The Universe Eye in Dallas discovered unique mutants. After calculating their route, it seems their destination is Austin.]</p>
<p>He hid the fact that it is Narsiel and Vanessa. Providing information is also against the rules. Cha Jun Sung has hunted Narsiel in the virtual.</p>
<p>Then he will be able to figure out who she is by looking at her.</p>
<p>[Sending video.]</p>
<p>A hologram expands in a dark room. Narsiel and Vanessa come up in that video. Cha Jun Sung frowns.</p>
<p>There is a countdown. The time gets shorter. Cha Jun Sung cannot hear it ticking, but he feels like he can.</p>
<p>[04:59:53]</p>
<p>[04:59:52]</p>
<p>It marks the time left until Narsiel and Vanessa arrive in Austin. It started at 5 hours and now 7 or 8 seconds have passed.</p>
<p>That is the time calculated if they do not increase their speed. Cha Jun Sung recognized Narsiel quickly because he has seen her face before. He also knows Odelia and Benukiz’s faces, so it wasn’t hard for him to figure out that the other is Vanessa.</p>
<p>“2 against 1.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung sat down and scored the odds. He did not say 3 against 1 but 2 to 1 because he does not know that Odelia is in Austin.</p>
<p>Benukiz and Odelia are on the weaker side of middle level 8-s, but the gap in power becomes distinctly wider starting with Narsiel. From his experience with her in the virtual version, Narsiel is a half time stronger than Benukiz. But he isn’t concerned with Narsiel, but Vanessa.</p>
<p>‘If the 2nd daughter shows her other face, you can take on all of the sisters.’</p>
<p>This is what Narsiel told him before she died in the virtual version.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 200</p>
<p>Being able to take mutants like that on 3 against 1 is proof of getting close to level 9. Not even Red Eye can do that. Any combination of 2 to 1 is doable excluding Vanessa, but 3 to 1 is too much. Red Eye wins if it is a combination of Odelia and Benukiz, and a close fight if a Narsiel combination.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung as a Perfection is stronger than Red Eye. He lacks 2% due to an absence of various items, but he exceeds level 8 in pure combat ability. The power he has is between level 8 and 9.</p>
<p>Comparing Red Eye and Cha Jun Sung’s combat ability, this situation now when he cannot find Odelia is welcome. The problem is that Two Faced Vanessa will be in that fight where he can face all of the sisters. It is the worst combination since they are the 2 strongest.</p>
<p>“Vanessa, Vanessa.”</p>
<p>After Cha Jun Sung hunted 3 of the 4 sisters and prepared for his raid against Evil Queen in the virtual, he had looked for information on Vanessa.</p>
<p>There was not much, and he was only able to find snippets.</p>
<p>[Of the 3 males and 4 females born from Evil Queen and Bon Load, Vanessa is the only half blood with characteristics of both level 9-s.]</p>
<p>The daughters have Evil Queen’s characteristics and the sons have Bon Load’s, but Vanessa alone inherited both.</p>
<p>So she has another nickname in addition to Two Faced – Half Blood. She would rank level 8 with just one but if she has genes of two that are strong, there is no way to know who will win until they face off.</p>
<p>Much less with Narsiel, it is a good opportunity but one that feels like it should be avoided.</p>
<p>[04:25:12]</p>
<p>“Ugh! Just one should come, why are both of them coming at the same time?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung decided to back off. It is a waste, but he will get another chance.</p>
<p>[Oh, well.]</p>
<p>“What now? Will you stop surprising me?”</p>
<p>Odin did not answer Cha Jun Sung’s question, and pulled up a video from the Universe Eye like when he discovered Narsiel and Vanessa.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>[Keep watching. I think you can make your final decision after watching this.]</p>
<p>The video that Odin pulled up is from the Universe Eye in Austin. A force level of Lifers is moving somewhere.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung did not complain, and just watched. Odin can see all of Austin like it is the back of his hand. It means he knows the result of these words.</p>
<p>“Could that be.”</p>
<p>The screen brightens. More precisely, it can be mistaken that the background of the environment on screen has become red.</p>
<p>“Path of Blood.”</p>
<p>Odelia is obsessively compulsive and makes her entire home red. The hair that grows all over her body becomes a brush and the pocket that holds the money she got through torture becomes paint. That is how she paints.</p>
<p>In Cha Jun Sung’s eyes, that is Path of Blood, the way to Odelia’s home.</p>
<p>The fact that this path came out means that Odelia is in Austin or it is a trace of her having been here. She does not stay in one place. She goes around in search of subjects for torture.</p>
<p>“Is the final decision… that Odelia’s in Austin? What! Then that means Narsiel and Vanessa are coming to see their sister. It’s a scam!”</p>
<p>It is not 2 against 1. It might become 3 to 1 like this. No matter how comparatively weak Odelia is, she is a level 8. She has a blow in her own way.</p>
<p>[It’s okay. There’s time left, so you can make the decision later.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung calmed down and focused on the video.</p>
<p>It is as Odin said. There are still 4 hours left until they get here.</p>
<p>He can look at everything and then make his decision. Lifers arrive at the Path of Blood and are taken aback. The environment has changed and the atmosphere has grown dark. They cannot figure out what has happened.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>“Odelia.”</p>
<p>Red Spider, Princess of Fresh Blood Odelia jumped out from among buildings. These mysterious Lifers had walked into hell on their own.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung considered whether he should help or not, and gave up in the end.</p>
<p>They are at least 25km away. He cannot help them even if he runs to them now. Even if they are lucky and he is able to rescue them, Cha Jun Sung is not in a good situation either.</p>
<p>He could be sandwiched by Narsiel and Vanessa while fighting Odelia. He cannot risk their own lives and help them.</p>
<p>When we get involved, we do so by volition. Others are not subjects of consideration.</p>
<p>“If Austin is Odelia’s home, it should have been separated as a danger zone. Why are other Lifers here? Are they going to say it’s another mission error?”</p>
<p>[No, it is not. Please pay attention to that man.]</p>
<p>Wiing!</p>
<p>The Universe Eye focuses on a Lifer who does not look particularly different. But when he approached Odelia, he moved behind her.</p>
<p>What is this? What is this situation?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung blinks.</p>
<p>[I backtracked their route and they trickled down from the north. This is a danger zone, but north is a normal mission area.]</p>
<p>There is no Universe Eye installed in the north. That is why it was guessed that it is Austin, but that Lifer led the force.</p>
<p>“Ha! Is it a lure? Is he presenting Lifers to Odelia or something?”</p>
<p>[It seems so, though I cannot tell why.]</p>
<p>Does he have a deal?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung rages inside. There are things that you can do and things that you can’t. Those actions are worse than murder.</p>
<p>“How about Narsiel and Vanessa?”</p>
<p>[They are coming. Their estimated time of arrival has not changed.]</p>
<p>The speed is constant. Cha Jun Sung brought up the best and worst case scenarios. He has 4 hours of time. The best case is that he kills Odelia within that time and runs away. The worst is that he is unable to kill her and gets caught.</p>
<p>“Damn it. What’s there to think about.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stood up. The amount of time he has is finite.</p>
<p>As time shortens, the width for activity grows more and more narrow.</p>
<p>The situation grew disadvantageous for him even while he is thinking now.</p>
<p>He needs to move quickly if he is to have any odds of getting what he wants.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to get away from here within 4 hours, no 3, right?”</p>
<p>Considering error, he needs to leave 1 hour of time. No matter how weak Odelia is, she is a level 8. It is hard to kill her within a matter of hours.</p>
<p>[Comparing Lifer Cha Jun Sung and a weak one’s combat abilities, there is plenty possibility. As long as external variables are not applied.]</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung steps off of the terrace connected to the living room, and jumped into the air.</p>
<p>It is 5 hours.</p>
<p>Faster is better. He will kill Odelia and get out of this place.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>25km distance. It is said that people can go 4km if they walk for 1 hour, which means it should take more than 5 hours for that distance.</p>
<p>It did not even take 25 minutes for Cha Jun Sung to go that distance.</p>
<p>The Universe Eye marked the route with the shortest distance for him on the electronic map. He arrived quickly because he flew and there was no reason for him to go off route.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung decreased his booster’s output and landed on a building with dozens of floors. Then he made sure not to make a sound as he went closer to Odelia.</p>
<p>Once he reached a certain distance, the disgusting scent of blood tickled his senses. He knows why this is because of the Universe Eye. He can’t help but curse. Most of the Lifers became invalids in that short time of 20 minutes.</p>
<p>They had been disabled so that they could not rebel or run away. Level 8 Odelia might as well be the Grim Reaper to those level C Lifers.</p>
<p>Odelia lifts a Lifer into the air by the leg and cuts off his arms. A hair that is as thin as thread goes through his battle suit.</p>
<p>“Hee hee! This is great!”</p>
<p>“Crazy bitch.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung curses Odelia while he is hiding. The things she does is the same as she did in the virtual version. This bitch isn’t normal. Even the word ‘bitch’ isn’t enough for her.</p>
<p>[04:01:05]</p>
<p>Odelia doesn’t realize that Cha Jun Sung is there even though he has gotten so close to her he is only 50m away. His battle suit is great, but she is also distracted by the torture.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill her with maximum output.”</p>
<p>It’s a time attack anyway. He won’t be exploring or anything, so there is no reason to save his strength while fighting. 3 hours isn’t enough time in taking on a level 8.</p>
<p>[Battlecore, Overbooster 100% deployed.]</p>
<p>[Full combat function, Overmode activated with overlap of the battlecore and Overbooster! 8 hours until engine overheat, energy recovery rate 50% control!]</p>
<p>It is just in case. If he cannot avoid meeting Narsiel and Vanessa, he needs to have killed Odelia at the least. Divide and conquer.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 201</p>
<p>The opportunity is when she is separated from them and alone. The 2 against 1 Vanessa combination is burdensome, but there is a higher chance that he can win than if Odelia is included in there to make it 3 against 1.</p>
<p>If he is lucky, he might be able to kill 3 of Evil Queen’s daughters. He cannot doubt that the reward is as sweet as it is dangerous. It will more than cover the costs of the Universe Eyes and there is the possibility that it will be a level A special mission.</p>
<p>It is 3 level 8-s. Difficulties will overlap so there needs to be discretion.</p>
<p>It is the worst case scenario. Cha Jun Sung is thinking of just killing Odelia and getting out. He will only put himself in a bad situation if he needs to. The circumstances do not call for that right now.</p>
<p>‘A blow won’t be able to kill her. She’s a level 8 even if she’s weak. It needs to be fatal!’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went at Odelia like a beast going after its prey.</p>
<p>He is so fast that reacting would be impossible, but Odelia managed to react.</p>
<p>Hundreds of hairs reflexively attacked Cha Jun Sung. The route of the hairs shooting at the battle suit’s hologram draw out in a line.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>“Die, you red sadist.”</p>
<p>Odelia was taken aback. It is surprising that he was able to fool her senses and hide, but it should be impossible to completely detect her attack.</p>
<p>For an instant, the dozens of pairs of eyes between her upper and lower body look towards Cha Jun Sung’s belt. Her instincts warn her that it will become dangerous if he pulls that out.</p>
<p>Odelia is rushed and throws the Lifer she is holding, at Cha Jun Sung. He cannot tell if the Lifer is alive or not, but his decision did not take long.</p>
<p>Hades came out, went through the Lifer and flew toward Odelia. A clear color does not come up, but the sharp feeling is there.</p>
<p>But for the moment Cha Jun Sung was in consideration, Odelia increased the distance with sleek body movements and avoided the sword.</p>
<p>Brandishing from bottom to top, horizontally. Odelia concentrated her skills and watched the aura of the weapon passing right under her nose.</p>
<p>It is a haze.</p>
<p>She can tell without having it touch her. It is dangerous if she gets hit.</p>
<p>When Odelia avoided it, the building behind her splits. If the extracted energy is that much, she can guess how much the sword itself has.</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung’s surprise attack failed, he put the Overbooster in reverse and took position to go into real battle.</p>
<p>Assaulting while in the air with just the output from the booster does not bring out as much speed as would come from kicking off from the ground. There is nothing to support his lower body.</p>
<p>Air war is something that he is relatively confident in, but Odelia is not a flying mutant. There is no need to act like a bird.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>A part of the building that was hit by the force, collapses. The sound was so loud that it was like thunder, but no one inside cared about the sound. Lifers who had been tortured, the Lifer who lured them there, even Odelia who avoided the hit – no one could understand what was happening.</p>
<p>“What – what are you?”</p>
<p>“I don’t have time to talk. I need to end this within 3 hours.”</p>
<p>The Overbooster emits the refined flames and gets excited. It prepares to charge like a bull going at a red flag.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for Narsiel and Vanessa, he would have talked to her about Evil Queen to get some information, but he does not have time for that.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung needs to keep one thing in mind in his battle with Odelia – that he needs to kill her as quickly as possible. That is this battle’s goal.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s body becomes hazy with maximum output from the Overmode.</p>
<p>It is not teleportation. He is moving with incredible speed, so much so that it leaves an afterimage.</p>
<p>Ping ping!</p>
<p>Odelia launches the fur all over her body everywhere.</p>
<p>She could not determine Cha Jun Sung’s movements precisely with her transcendental senses. She covered all directions. A living creature needs to reveal itself and that method works.</p>
<p>At Odelia’s side in the air where there is nothing, the hairs are cut into pieces. That is where Cha Jun Sung showed himself.</p>
<p>“You’re smart!”</p>
<p>“Who do you think I am, coming at me!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung laughs. Whatever her personality is like, her combat style is outstanding. Since she can’t see him, she’ll just attack everywhere surrounding her.</p>
<p>But how long can that last?</p>
<p>It is just a temporary measure, but it just becomes a way of buying time if she is pushed back in specifications. There’s no way they don’t know that!</p>
<p>‘Odelia’s weakness was her upper body, right? If I cut that off, half of it’s done.’</p>
<p>He can win even if he doesn’t go for the upper body, but what’s good is good. It is just that the center is in the lower body so it is not easy to land a hit.</p>
<p>Odelia does not know that Cha Jun Sung knows her weakness. That is why she is not hiding it.</p>
<p>“You cullion! I’ll make you beg me to kill you!”</p>
<p>Odelia got the hint that Cha Jun Sung does not want to talk. If he won’t answer when she asks, there’s no point in doing so.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>Odelia’s 8 legs squirm and go near Cha Jun Sung. She crushes any obstacles with her trunk.</p>
<p>Odelia is a mid-sized mutant. There are constraints if there are a lot of buildings. The terrain here is not complicated. It is not an urban area with buildings everywhere so after repeating the same actions a few times, they created the optimal area for battle.</p>
<p>“What a useless trick.”</p>
<p>Dust comes out of the collapsed building. Odelia uses her clustered fur like a fan and flies at Cha Jun Sung. Vision becomes blurred.</p>
<p>Humans depend on sight the most. This is not very different for Cha Jun Sung, so he feels frustrated if his sight becomes paralyzed.</p>
<p>But when a Lifer who has gone through body modifications and has a battle suit loses sight, other senses make up for it.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>Odelia watched Cha Jun Sung’s back, twisted her fur, and transformed it into the shape of a spear. Odelia is not a mutant that can mutate her whole body or parts of her body. She just knows how to maximize use of her body.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung used his sense of hearing to avoid all of the attacks. The fur that became a spear go into the ground. It does not hit him, but keeps chasing and stabbing at him wherever he moves.</p>
<p>His sight is fine. The battle suit’s heat sensor and UV detection mode show him which direction Odelia is moving in and how. Odelia took color from him.</p>
<p>“So you’re slowly starting to change your pattern!”</p>
<p>Her spider’s lower body, or more precisely her hip, twists and launches a thick needle at Cha Jun Sung. It is almost like a missile. Fur attack is basic. Odelia has various patterns.</p>
<p>Being hit by that needle is dangerous in itself, but it contains a vicious poison that can kill most things with basic tolerance just by grazing them.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung brings his sword down. The end of the large poison dart, a part that is so small it cannot even be measured in mm, is split in half by Cha Jun Sung’s sword. Poison spills from where it has been split, but it did not touch the battle suit.</p>
<p>Looking closely, a purplish shield is acting as a barrier between the battle suit and poison. It is a barrier built into the battle suit.</p>
<p>The poison flows down the barrier. The poison that fell on the ground was already melting whatever it came in touch with. It is made of acid.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung broke the poison dart and with his body maintained by the Overbooster, he turned his waist and landed a powerful kick to the spider lower body.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>Red blood that is appropriate for her red body flies through the air. Something strange, that is hard to discern whether they are teeth or claws, break and fall all over the place.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Odelia stumbles.</p>
<p>It is no joke. It is a kick full of power. She is probably hearing bells in her head and seeing stars.</p>
<p>‘Now!’</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stepped on the ground by the law of gravity, got power from the Overbooster, stepped on Odelia’s lower body and ran toward her upper body.</p>
<p>She won’t die because he cuts that off, but her strength will be reduced and her regenerative power will weaken. It is not her nucleus, but it is just as important.</p>
<p>Bees swarm. Boosters all over his body burst.</p>
<p>Hades’ booster adds power as well. There is nothing that says he needs to apply it to drawing. If he cannot control it, he can keep controlling it with the booster while brandishing it.</p>
<p>“Oh – oh no!”</p>
<p>“You said you’ll make me beg for you to kill me? What a joke! I’m just going to kill you!”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 202</p>
<p>A volatile situation.</p>
<p>Time grows slower.</p>
<p>It did not actually get slower, but it was an important moment to both Cha Jun Sung and Odelia. Vacuum waves form from Hades. These vacuum waves surpass the speed of sound and is similar to a sonic boom. It pushes the air.</p>
<p>Odelia’s upper body swells like a balloon and a smooth and sturdy shell covers her. It is too late for her to avoid the attacks, so she will try to block them.</p>
<p>Then the fur all over her body wrap tightly and block Cha Jun Sung’s way. A series of courses occurred in the blink of an eye.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung thought he had stabbed her like in the first surprise attack, but Odelia coped with it well as a level 8. She copes so well it is annoying.</p>
<p>“Damn it!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung shouts in frustration. The 1-st wall of fur blocking his way is cut through and the 2nd wall of thickly wrapped fur is also cut through.</p>
<p>More than half of these 2 barriers are blown away Hades’ aura.</p>
<p>The shell is broken in the 3rd round but as a last attempt, Odelia’s muscular upper body withstands the weakened Hades’ cut.</p>
<p>“You persistent bitch!”</p>
<p>“A mere human!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung recovered Hades and hit Odelia’s chin with his knee. Her chin broke and her neck extended to the point where it looked like it would break, but Odelia’s left hand grew several times larger at the same time and hit Cha Jun Sung’s stomach.</p>
<p>With that one hit, Cha Jun Sung’s body goes flinging out 200 meters.</p>
<p>He went through buildings and was covered in asphalt. It is an impressive power.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is stronger than Odelia, but he cannot underestimate the difference in mass. Cha Jun Sung wearing the battle suit is about 400 kg. On the other than, Odelia weighs dozens of tons. He probably has an advantage overall, but he can only fall behind in muscular strength alone.</p>
<p>Odelia is in pain. Her neck bone is broken and her muscles have been ruptured. Her chin is broken, too. The more serious injury is that she consumed a lot of her nutrients because of Hades’ waves. It is not a shield that she created easily.</p>
<p>“Ugh! Save -!”</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p>Odelia shoved Lifers on the ground into the mouth on her lower body. She is in a rush.</p>
<p>She does not know why he is after her, but he is as strong an opponent as her sisters. Odelia knows that she does not have anyone in the vicinity to help her and she needs to handle this situation on her own.</p>
<p>“You bitch! Stop it!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung reappeared suddenly and interfered in Odelia’s disgusting meal.</p>
<p>He is not a saint to sacrifice himself.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean he is a pessimist who looks at the world in a crooked way either.</p>
<p>He is just powerful in combat ability, but he is a normal person who accepts something if it is advantageous for him and wants to leave something if it is disadvantageous to him. He has no intention to put his life on the line to save these Lifers, but he cannot pretend he has not seen this when he has already interfered in the situation.</p>
<p>Odelia is centered after eating the Lifers.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went under her lower body and cut one of her 8 legs.</p>
<p>She did not fall over but she could not avoid shaking up her balance.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang bang!</p>
<p>To the regular Lifers, the battle between Cha Jun Sung and a level 8 mutant looked like that of a war of gods. A few even forgot the pain they were feeling from torture.</p>
<p>They may not know, but Cha Jun Sung is pulling Odelia away little by little so as not to sweep the Lifers up into the battle. He is also trying to prevent her from filling her nutrients by eating the Lifers. He is fighting with his life. He cannot only think of others.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung met eyes with a Lifer who is hiding far away and watching the battlefield. It is the Lifer he suspects was luring the Lifers to Odelia.</p>
<p>He cannot see his face because the battle suit is covering it, but he wants to talk to him if he has time to after the battle. He wants to know how he came to do something so horrid. He will kill him on the spot if he is a psycho, and if he had a reason… he will make the decision then.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>[02:59:59]</p>
<p>He has the time up on the hologram at the side of his helmet so he can check it at any time, and it says that he has reached 3 hours. He has 2 hours left now.</p>
<p>Injuries form one by one on Odelia’s large body. She did not stop at the fur and poison darts, and is now attacking with string characteristic of a spider.</p>
<p>Spider webs are tricky to deal with because there is a variety of them, but that is it.</p>
<p>She is holding out but at this rate, there is no problem in finishing in the time he allotted for himself. It is helping him out a lot that he has fought her before.</p>
<p>When he developed as a Perfection in the virtual version, he worked hard to adjust to her changing patterns of attack. Her fur, her poison darts, her web, and…</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>“This little rat! It’s over! This is my area from now on!”</p>
<p>Red liquid sprays out of Odelia’s pores. It is poisonous blood she created by combining the blood she had saved in her pocket and her poison. The poisonous blood spreads out to a radius of hundreds of meters.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung blocks the blood with an energy shield. It is a disadvantageous environment for him, but he does not despair.</p>
<p>“You’ve reached your end.”</p>
<p>Her poisonous blood is proof that she has been pushed to the edge. Since she has declared her area with confidence, he needs to break her with power.</p>
<p>xxx</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>A red fog covers everything in poisonous blood so nothing is visible. It is so thick that he cannot even see with battle suit functions.</p>
<p>A blocked space.</p>
<p>Every time Cha Jun Sung and Odelia collide, shockwaves come out and the poisonous blood rocks like a wave, but it does not scatter.</p>
<p>It actually just looks like it is not scattering. The color is growing lighter as time passes. Odelia is a subject producing the blood. She cannot produce it indefinitely, so she is bound to become exhausted. The amount is decreasing and the color is getting lighter – she is in a disadvantageous situation in various ways.</p>
<p>“He can’t… he can’t kill her…..”</p>
<p>The Lifer who lured the other Lifers to Odelia, Hector, stammers. Hector is standing far from the two and watching their battle. It is not a fight that he can interfere in. He will be overpowered the moment he enters, and he will die even before then because of the poisonous blood.</p>
<p>Hector goes near the blood. It is dangerous, but there is nothing he can do. Odelia did not just capture his brother. He has been neutralized with a poison. As far as he knows, the only one who knows of the antidote is the subject herself.</p>
<p>The unknown Lifer who appeared suddenly has incredible power, but the situation his brother is in is a separate issue. If Odelia dies, his brother also dies. This is a brother he wanted to protect even if it meant becoming a murderer himself. He cannot leave him to die now.</p>
<p>Inside the poisonous blood, Cha Jun Sung realized that Odelia’s strength has reached its end and exploded the energy barrier protecting his battle suit. A purple magnetic field spreads out like water and pushes the blood away.</p>
<p>Is it because there was damage to the space?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s surroundings become distorted and electricity sparks. This phenomena lasted for a while and then disappeared.</p>
<p>[Remaining energy 68.2%, 31.8% is good against a level 8.]</p>
<p>Odelia really is weak, but she does her level’s worth.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung even has a high probability of getting level 7-s with a single blow. But he fought for several hours.</p>
<p>[01:45:15]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung saw the time and is satisfied. He has 45 minutes more than he had initially expected. It is a time attack he had not had in mind, but he has evaluated a level 8’s strength.</p>
<p>The poisonous blood was gathered together in one place and disappears as though blown away by wind.</p>
<p>It is the blood that had not disappeared even after Cha Jun Sung burst his barrier.</p>
<p>The covered Odelia appears.</p>
<p>She looks miserable and has protected her human body for the most part, but her spider body has been reduced to rags. Her fur that had once been full now looks as though she is balding, and she has blood flowing from various wounds in her flesh.</p>
<p>The 8 legs that had been in charge of her mobility are also barely standing with only 4 leftover. Her tail, which can sting, is also opened up. She cannot even fill up her nutrients because he has pulled her away from the Lifers. She might be able to move, but Cha Jun Sung won’t just let that happen.</p>
<p>In a situation where she cannot regenerate, she can’t do anything and is basically defenseless.</p>
<p>“How – how could this be… A human. A mere human! To the great me!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is annoyed with the noisy Odelia, and cut off 2 more legs. She cannot keep her balance and falls to one side.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 203</p>
<p>“By what standards are you great? Are mutants so great? Go to hell.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung steps on Odelia’s lower body and goes up.</p>
<p>On TV, there is always a reversal at the end because people drag out the time, and he does not want to see that happening.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung brought Hades down. It is against Odelia’s upper body. He brought it down easily because she is not in a state to defend herself.</p>
<p>Nuclei of top level mutants are flexible and move constantly.</p>
<p>In Odelia’s case, if he destroys her upper body which is her weakness, he can stop the nucleus’ flow. That is why the order is getting rid of the upper body and then the nucleus.</p>
<p>Clang!</p>
<p>“What are you doing?”</p>
<p>“You – you can’t kill Odelia. Please!”</p>
<p>“Are you normally crazy or did you go crazy because of Odelia?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung frowns. Hector blocked Hades with a reinforced rifle. He can’t kill her? This isn’t something someone can do in their right mind.</p>
<p>The strength in Hades becomes more and more powerful. Hector is unable to withstand the difference in the pressure of body modifications and battle suit, and falls to his knees.</p>
<p>Hades’ movement toward Odelia strays.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is annoyed and throws Hector by his face.</p>
<p>But he regains his balance mid flight and comes back.</p>
<p>He would not have been able to regain his posture so quickly if Cha Jun Sung had thrown him with intent to kill.</p>
<p>“My brother has been poisoned by Odelia and captured by her. If you kill her, he dies too. Please! Don’t kill her. I’m begging you!”</p>
<p>“Poison?”</p>
<p>Odelia uses a variety of poisons, but her poisonous blood is the best. If there is an antidote for the poisonous blood, there has to be antidotes for other poisons as well.</p>
<p>“Ye – yeah! His brother dies too! He he! I heard humans are weak in the face of affection.”</p>
<p>“Shut up, you wretch. I thought you said we’re mere humans? Don’t use English when you’re a mere mutant. I guess you learned it well since you are Evil Queen’s daughter.”</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung cut off the remaining 2 legs. She is disturbing his thinking. She is experiencing this kind of pain for the first time in her life.</p>
<p>‘The detoxification method…”</p>
<p>It is surprisingly simple.</p>
<p>In the virtual version, the antidote was touching her nucleus. It is unknown whether that method will work in reality as well.</p>
<p>He feels sorry for Hector, but he cannot let her live even if it does not work as the antidote.</p>
<p>Wiing!</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung! Narsiel and Vanessa have sped up! Calculating speed… Calculation complete. They have increased by 157%! End it quickly!]</p>
<p>157% means they have more than doubled their speed. Odin substituted the speed in the time attack and recalculated.</p>
<p>[00:42:18]</p>
<p>When they are moving outside the Universe Eye’s radius, Odin cannot track their spede either. He can only estimate around when they will arrive.</p>
<p>However, they were exposed to the Universe Eye installed in Austin when they arrived faster than was expected. That means that there had been a change in speed from when they were not watching.</p>
<p>“Why are they doing that!”</p>
<p>[It seems like a last-minute spurt.]</p>
<p>Is their thinking that they’ll arrive quickly instead of slowing down since they are almost at their destination?</p>
<p>It is not a good sign.</p>
<p>“Tsk!”</p>
<p>“Ack! No!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung cut Odelia’s upper body. She is not dead yet. It just looks like she is dead. If he leaves her like this, she will regenerate a while later. Hector is devastated. His face has darkened as though he has lost the world. But there is nothing he can do.</p>
<p>“Odin, find Odelia’s nucleus. Quickly.”</p>
<p>[Search mode activated. It is on the left side of her heart in the spider body. If you split Odelia’s bottom half, you will be able to reach it easily.]</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung put Hades in its hilt and moved by power.</p>
<p>Odelia’s body split with one blow because it is defenseless. Odin marks where the nucleus is via hologram. Cha Jun Sung sticks his arm into the disgusting flesh and forces the nucleus out.</p>
<p>Then he broke it into pieces.</p>
<p>He did it just in case because the mission complete notice did not come up.</p>
<p>[You have killed Evil Queen’s youngest daughter, Princess of Fresh Blood Odelia. You have earned 1.5 billion points and 300 million achievement points. You have completed level A mission, Path of Blood. You have earned 1.1 billion reward points.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 204</p>
<p>Odin thought that the one at the top had used that method for examination. With his authority, he was plenty capable of creating a situation like this. He is one of the top 3 executives who designed Life Mission after all. Of the 3, he is the one who put his all into getting results from Life Mission, but he did not always gear in a good direction. What occurred in Africa had happened because he pushed hard for it as well.</p>
<p>At the time, the other 2 executives had agreed to go along with it because were not forcing each Lifer, but were completely shaking up a mission system that they had created.</p>
<p>The situation this time is different.</p>
<p>Putting the fact that they were making it impossible for Lifers to return even after completing their missions aside, intervening with Lifers’ items cannot happen.</p>
<p>The Africa incident was a bigger problem in size, but the problem now is bigger in the details. This is a full intervention of the responsible party.</p>
<p>[00:09:21]</p>
<p>9 minutes left.</p>
<p>He needs to decide on his actions now, whether it will be to fight or run away.</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with you, right?”</p>
<p>[I can promise you. It absolutely does not.]</p>
<p>“Then tell me what’s happening once this situation is all settled.”</p>
<p>No matter how much Life Mission has the upper hand and they are at a disadvantage, he has no intention of becoming a puppet.</p>
<p>There is a lot that he must know. If they are going to operate this however they want, it is better to forget Life Mission and live normally in reality.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>Odin heard Cha Jun Sung and quickly skimmed through Life Mission’s clauses. But nowhere could he find any provision applicable to what he said.</p>
<p>It is made so that he cannot confess any secrets regarding Life Mission, the executives, or the helpers. They are absolutely in the advantage.</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>Odin’s system stops at one section of clauses.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t this work? It looks like it could work. This is what was written.</p>
<p>If an incident arises in which a Lifer’s unique permission is infringed upon by Life Mission’s arbitrary purposes, he must be compensated with a reasonable recompense.</p>
<p>However, this is only possible if the Lifer launches a formal complaint. A helper cannot make a statement that creates a problem.</p>
<p>This is an adverse clause to Lifers as well. They must make formal complaints.</p>
<p>Helpers cannot confess “It is our fault!’ If they do not know and move past it, the situation becomes buried.</p>
<p>[Does that mean that you are making a complaint against Life Mission right now?]</p>
<p>“Complaint?”</p>
<p>[Will Lifer Cha Jun Sung file an official complaint against Life Mission as it has infringed upon your personal authority? Please state your stance.]</p>
<p>“Whatever. I’ll do it. It’s a complaint.”</p>
<p>[The 2nd officer infringed upon Lifer Cha Jun Sung’s rights first.]</p>
<p>[According to Lifer Compensation Law article 9 clause 26, I will answer your questions regarding the specified provision when this situation is safely settled.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was thinking that Odin was being strangely accommodating today, but that was just for a moment.</p>
<p>He needed to be prepared for Narsiel and Vanessa.</p>
<p>“From the way things are going, it looks like they’re trying to instigate fights. Am I crazy to fight not just one, but two? It’s over if I just run.”</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung released the Overmode and quickly abandoned his position. The Overmode consumes a tremendous amount of energy even when it is sitting inactive. There is no reason for keep it active when the battle is over.</p>
<p>[Where are you planning on going?]</p>
<p>“I don’t have a destination I’ve decided on or anything. I just have to put out the immediate fires first.”</p>
<p>He needs to get as far from Austin as he can. He is running with his booster on. It says 200km/h on the speedometer that comes up on his hologram. Cha Jun Sung’s battlesuit is on the slow side, but it is the speed of a decent sports car. Objects speed by quickly.</p>
<p>[Narsiel and Vanessa have just arrived where we were. We are getting further away because they are not moving.]</p>
<p>This is welcome news.</p>
<p>It is a terrible situation that his return route has been blocked. Once he gets away from here, he can take his time to think of solution. The getaway was fine. At this rate, he can get away from Austin without any large complications.</p>
<p>But the 2nd officer is not that accommodating.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>A 30m diameter gate opened up in the sky. It is the biggest gate Cha Jun Sung has seen since playing Life Mission. A square shaped machine that he did not recognize, showed itself. Even at a glance, it was giving off an unusual vibe.</p>
<p>“What’s that?”</p>
<p>[Goodness! Heavy Gravity! Summoning gear that hasn’t been completed yet!]</p>
<p>While Cha Jun Sung was puzzled and Odin was astonished, a transparent veil appeared at a 50km radius around the machine called Heavy Gravity. Since it had appeared with Cha Jun Sung as the target, he did not make it far before he had to stop. A hazy wall was blocking his way.</p>
<p>[Calculating range….. Calculation complete. Narsiel and Vanessa are trapped inside as well. It is exactly the distance from here to Austin.]</p>
<p>“It just looks like a thin membrane. Should I turn on the energy barrier and go through it?”</p>
<p>[You can’t! Heavy Gravity is a gravity field. Not even a fully remodeled battlesuit is guaranteed to withstand it.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung tried throwing a rock the size of a human head a the barrier.</p>
<p>The rock turned to dust the second it touched the barrier. It was not just crushed.</p>
<p>It really became dust.</p>
<p>The kind of dust that will fly away in the wind.</p>
<p>[It might look like a thin membrane, but that barrier is made of a material that contains 100 times the standard force of gravity. It does not end with one pass.]</p>
<p>If he tries to get past it, a gravity field could be activated 2 or 3 times, maybe even 4 times in succession. The 2nd officer is throwing everything in. It is machinery that has not been completed yet. They experimented on narrow ranges several times, but they don’t know if it activates in an extensive area. But he even used an incomplete machine in order to instigate a fight.</p>
<p>“Ha! Have I become a toy?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung promised to return to reality even if he had to awaken into a mutant and break through. There is something he needs to hear from Odin.</p>
<p>[I have bad news.]</p>
<p>“What could get worse from here….. What is it?”</p>
<p>[The Lifer who handed over Odelia’s nucleus and the sibling have been captured by Narsiel and Vanessa. It looks like they were unable to run away in time.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung held his forehead in his hand.</p>
<p>In his hologram, he could see Narsiel dragging the two with a finger that she had turned into a tentacle.</p>
<p>It looked like she was mumbling something, but he unfortunately could not hear it. He wants to rescue them, but he did not want to risk the danger and go back either.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Is it because they knew what he was feeling?</p>
<p>The Heavy Gravity makes a sound. Then the gravity field narrows. Cha Jun Sung took steps backwards. He really felt like he was about to go crazy.</p>
<p>They are making it so that they have no choice but to meet. This is a shitty situation he can’t make disappear with cursing, so his only option is to fight.</p>
<p>“I’ll pay back as much as I’m being wronged. I’m feeling it deep within my bones.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung grind his teeth and changed his direction to Austin.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Human, what happened here? What happened to my sister!”</p>
<p>Narsiel harrasses the two Lifers.</p>
<p>She just bothers them because she cannot kill them, and she vents that anger on the older brother. Because he was wearing his battlesuit, he had an advantage over his brother in enduring this.</p>
<p>“I, I don’t know any….. Hack hack!”</p>
<p>“Brother!”</p>
<p>Hector won’t say anything as if he does not know anything, but Narsiel is not stupid. She is asking because she has a hunch.</p>
<p>“The smell is telling me that this nucleus is my sister. There’s no way someone like you could kill my sister! Who is it! Who killed my sister!”</p>
<p>Vanessa stopped paying attention to what Narsiel was doing, and examined Odelia’s corpse. Like Benukiz, the wounds look as though she was attacked unilaterally.</p>
<p>The focus of the attacks and the traces of wounds are similar as well. The probability that they are the same person is 99.9%. To think that 2 of her sisters were killed by a mere human. She is incredibly surprised, she is just not showing it.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>It is a fairly large distance.</p>
<p>He can still hear them clearly, so he turned his head toward Vanessa and Narsiel’s location. He can see a large life form.</p>
<p>“Is it a machine.”</p>
<p>Vanessa has also encountered a fair amount of machines. Among the humans who live off of her mother, Evil Queen, there are a few who are well-versed in machines. They let them live because they are convenient at times, but there is something different about this.</p>
<p>As the gravity field produced by the Heavy Gravity swept the waste buildings of Austin, they blew away in the wind like the rock that Cha Jun Sung had thrown. The Heavy Gravity did not stop until it had reached a radius of 5km.</p>
<p>It is the limit.</p>
<p>It cannot narrow beyond this because there is a set minimum.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 205</p>
<p>They could not see the scattering particles clearly, but this was not a phenomenon that Narsiel and Vanessa could understand with the scientific knowledge that they had.</p>
<p>Narsiel harassed Hector for the information that she wanted, and Vanessa got some information from Odelia’s corpse.</p>
<p>“The body temperature is being maintained. It hasn’t been long since she died. He could be nearby.”</p>
<p>Odelia’s corpse is not warm but it is not cold either.</p>
<p>A lot of time had passed in Benukiz’s case, so her corpse was already in the deterioration process.</p>
<p>Vanessa turned her body and approached Narsiel. She elongated her fingernail and cut Hector’s brother’s arm off without any hesitation.</p>
<p>Ack!</p>
<p>“Where is he? If you tell me, I’ll let him live.”</p>
<p>“I’ll – I’ll tell! I’ll tell you everything I – I know! Just let my brother live!”</p>
<p>Vanessa stopped moving. Hector relayed everything he had seen and felt. But Vanessa was not satisfied.</p>
<p>What was it?</p>
<p>It felt like the essentials were missing. It was hard to guess who it was.</p>
<p>Eyes full of despair – Vanessa saw the truth in those eyes.</p>
<p>Mutants can sense others feelings, whether it is a thirst for blood or hostility.</p>
<p>It seemed like he really had told her everything he knew. That’s why she was annoyed.</p>
<p>They had come here without delay. But their youngest had still died.</p>
<p>What would they say to their mother?</p>
<p>They cannot go back empty-handed.</p>
<p>‘If, perchance….. he’s near. If he’s watching us.’</p>
<p>There was no sign of him.</p>
<p>If he has the ability to kill Benukiz and Odelia unilaterally, of course they cannot find his location by sense.</p>
<p>“I will rip a limb from those two in intervals from now on. They will live if you appear in front of us, and they will die if you hide.”</p>
<p>Since they do not have an accurate watch to calculate the time for them, she intends on waiting by feeling it out.</p>
<p>Vanessa started with cutting the younger brother’s arm.</p>
<p>When it became time, the other arm was cut off. Blood comes out.</p>
<p>He is hanging on right now because of his body modifications, but he will only last minutes at most once his legs are cut off because of excessive bleeding. After all, blood is not unlimited.</p>
<p>‘I can’t go out.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was watching Vanessa, but he did not go out.</p>
<p>While playing Life Mission, he had become numb to the death of others and knew that his life was more precious.</p>
<p>He did enough for them. He will not do something useless like acting on feelings.</p>
<p>‘I would’ve crushed it already if I could have, but this is crazy in so many aspects.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks up at the Heavy Gravity floating in the air. If he could, he would use all of his power to crush that imposing figure. Odin said that there are small gravity fields nearby beyond those spread out on the ground to protect the gas.</p>
<p>The space is distorted under the immense pressure, and any object that tries to force its way through will be crushed.</p>
<p>Whether used for offense or defense, it is the ultimate airborne weapon that Life Mission’s scientific vortex could create. The only thing that could work in his favor is that it cannot maintain its state for a long period of time, but that is just Odin’s guess. The procedure to activate that weapon is complicated, even for the 2nd officer.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>While Cha Jun Sung focused on Narsiel and Vanessa, Odin kept an eye on the Heavy Gravity and tried to connect to the system but there was no use. The 2nd officer had placed restrictions on the system. This means that only the general manager and 3 executives can connect to it. There is no way for a helper to get through.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>When Odin attempted to connect, a part of the Heavy Gravity suddenly opened and a large, round bar came out. It is a gunport.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung, get away no…..]</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>A few bombs fall from the open gunport. They did not hit Cha Jun Sung directly. It was just a threatening shooting nearby. Odin had not been able to finish his sentence, and Cha Jun Sung was surrounded by a loud roar and dust. The serious issue was somewhere else.</p>
<p>“Sister.”</p>
<p>“Is that where he’s hiding?”</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Vanessa calls out with certainty. Narsiel raced to where there had been a change. It was a distance of hundreds of meters, but that did not matter.</p>
<p>When Narsiel arrived, she spread her senses wide.</p>
<p>The first sense to react was her hearing. The roar of a devil bursting out from the hazy dust. Narsiel’s body trembles slightly. Rather than feeling fear, her skin is reacting to the intrinsic aura held in that roar. Was what killed her sisters not a human, but a mutant?</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung activates his battlesuit and gets rid of the dust. He barely held on to his sanity and came back to his senses. He nearly awakened. Until now, he did not express it even if he felt rage.</p>
<p>It was because it had been bearable. But this time, his mind was blank. What could be the purpose of letting mutants know of his location? He was full of an impulse to split the head of whoever was doing this to him to pull out his brain. He had lost all trust.</p>
<p>[Li – Lifer Cha Jun Sung….. What happened…..]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had removed a part of his battlesuit to stop Odin from figuring out the state of his body and realizing that he has become a mutant.</p>
<p>But he had not been able to suppress a moment of rage, and half awakened while inside the battlesuit. So it seems Odin realized that something is weird. But what can be done. There is no use crying over spilt milk. It already happened and there is no way to undo it. He needs to just push forward.</p>
<p>There had been no external change because he had not awakened completely.</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung ignored him, Odin put his questions to the side and prepared to support him in the coming battle. Getting through this is first.</p>
<p>“I’m going to rip all of them apart! Those bitches! And those bastards! All of them!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looked at Narsiel and Vanessa in front of him and the Heavy Gravity in the air, and then rushed at Narsiel. He is omitting introductions with his attack.</p>
<p>“Was it a human? Then what about that roar just now? I’m certain that was a mutant.”</p>
<p>“Shut up and die!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung moved without stepping, and pulled Hades out first. The Overmode flashes through the space by way of the Overbooster. He is now right in front of Narsiel, who had been standing on a wreck.</p>
<p>And as soon as he approached her, he gave off the energy of one who intends to slash her up, while brandishing Hades in the air. It results in a strong air pressure. Narsiel, who is only in a half awakened state, is half a beat late in reacting but she is not Odelia. She cannot avoid it. She has to get hit. She will get hit enough to avoid a fatal wound.</p>
<p>Narsiel compresses her body and retreats. She waves around like a leaf flying in the wind. Hades grazes Narsiel. A wound formed on her entire body, but it was not severe because she had been injured with the intention of taking the hit. And there was something Narsiel believed in.</p>
<p>“You’re paying too much attention to me.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>He can feel movement behind him. He can tell who it is without looking. It is Vanessa. Cha Jun Sung ground his teeth as he stopped his attack.</p>
<p>He held Hades inversely and stabbed it between his upper arm.</p>
<p>“That doesn’t mean you should underestimate me.”</p>
<p>“Damn it!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>While his attention was elsewhere, Narsiel swung her thick arm and hit Cha Jun Sung. He plummeted to the ground under the tremendous shock.</p>
<p>Is it because they’re sisters? It seems they are good at passing. Cha Jun Sung had been unable to prepare himself because he had not encountered anything like this in the virtual version either.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung cleared off the wreck as he stood up. Narsiel smiles as she watches this. Her expression is that one of watching something fun and interesting.</p>
<p>“Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“That was dangerous. That guy isn’t a human.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying that because of the roar?”</p>
<p>“You’ll know when you see.”</p>
<p>Narsiel and Vanessa stand together. They did not think that Cha Jun Sung would die from a hit to the face. He will be fine.</p>
<p>“Look here, human.”</p>
<p>“Oh! Great. I’m supposed to kill anyone, whoever, right?”</p>
<p>“Human.”</p>
<p>“Stop calling me, you disgusting mutant.”</p>
<p>“What do you think?”</p>
<p>“Definitely….. There’s no way he would have understood what we’re saying if he were human.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was about to tell them to stop talking nonsense, but suddenly glared his eyes. Bells go off in his head. Narsiel and Vanessa are not speaking in English like Odelia had been. They are speaking in mutant language. But Cha Jun Sung had understood it.</p>
<p>Narsiel had not been able to understand him because he had spoken in Korean, but they knew that he had understood. The few words of dialogue exchanged during a short battle. Narsiel found the crucial point among the confusion of Korean and mutant language.</p>
<p>“Odin.”</p>
<p>[I’ll hear the explanation later.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 206</p>
<p>“Ah….. Is this why they say that stupid people shouldn’t even lie?”</p>
<p>He let out the secret he had been hiding because he had become over excited with rage. How bothersome will it become from now on? Will they harass him to test him?</p>
<p>“How did you know?”</p>
<p>“I tried it out just to see what would happen after hearing the roar, and you just understood it.”</p>
<p>He had fallen for it. Cha Jun Sung thought that Narsiel might be much smarter than he is. If that bitch had been a person, she would have gotten the Nobel Prize.</p>
<p>Vanessa takes a few steps forward. All of a sudden, Narsiel had taken a step back. Cha Jun Sung thought it was attack and took position.</p>
<p>“I’ll ask you a question. Did you kill Odelia?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I did it. Don’t worry. I’ll kill the both of you soon too.”</p>
<p>Vanessa asks in English. The human language is more precise in expression. Cha Jun Sung responds to Vanessa’s question. He speaks in Korean, but it is automatically translated to English through his translator.</p>
<p>“And Benukiz?”</p>
<p>“The 3rd daughter? Your little sister?”</p>
<p>“So it’s right.”</p>
<p>“What’s right? What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>What is she talking about, asking about Benukiz all of a sudden while talking about Odelia? Hang on. Does that mean Benukiz is dead? And the perpetrator is himself?</p>
<p>“Benukiz is dead?”</p>
<p>“Don’t act as if you don’t know. I know you killed Benukiz and then Odelia. We came here because we thought you might be here, and we were right.”</p>
<p>Narsiel’s voice becomes low. She is like a venomous snake full of poison.</p>
<p>His question had been answered. He had been wondering why there wasn’t a mission with Benukiz, but his theory that she was already dead was right.</p>
<p>But they had something wrong. Cha Jun Sung has never met Benukiz. He never even saw her shadow.</p>
<p>“How funny. If I got caught for killing Odelia, I would say that I killed Benukiz too if I killed her. Why would I hide that? Are you going to go easier on me?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung taunts them. Vanessa frowns because he makes sense. He is giving off the air of someone who is ready to kill them.</p>
<p>It’s strange that he is denying killing Benukiz in this situation.</p>
<p>“The traces left on her corpse are the same as the ones you left on Odelia. So much so that it looks like they were done by the same person.”</p>
<p>Narsiel adds to the explanation that the wounds were made by a human, not a mutant. Was it someone who uses a sword? A level A Lifer? Maybe level S?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung starts thinking. He is the first Lifer to open up level A. There is no doubt about this. However, Life Mission is expansive. Someone could have appeared after him. On top of that, the system is a complete mess. It wouldn’t be weird for something to happen, whether it is a bug or an error.</p>
<p>‘Maybe?’</p>
<p>Black Demon told him that the one he needs to meet in order to kill Evil Queen went over to North America. Did he kill her? That is possible.</p>
<p>“Aha! I think I know who it was.”</p>
<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>Narsiel was still sure that Cha Jun Sung is the perpetrator, but not Vanessa. No matter how she thought about it, there is no reason for him to lie about this.</p>
<p>“Do you guys know if I tell you who it is? Not even I know exactly who it is.”</p>
<p>Do they want his name? His nationality? Cha Jun Sung doesn’t know the specifics, but they wouldn’t matter to the mutants anyway.</p>
<p>A playful smile forms on Cha Jun Sung’s face. It isn’t visible because of his helmet, but he’s had an idea of how to play with those two.</p>
<p>“I don’t know who it is, but I think I know why he killed Benukiz. And what he wants. Even what he’ll do going forward!”</p>
<p>This he knows for sure. So he is going to tell them. Something beyond force is necessary in order to overpower the enemy. For example….. swaying their minds?</p>
<p>“Tell us and we’ll let you live.”</p>
<p>“Who are you trying to scam? A mutant making a promise? Don’t be stupid. And who are you two to let me live or die? You’re weak.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung hurt Narsiel’s ego. Vanessa just watched. She must know about the person who killed Benukiz before they kill Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>The 3rd and 4th daughters are weak. Narsiel could take both of them on alone. Even if she could not win, she could create a close match. She herself is confident she could take on 3.</p>
<p>“Evil Queen.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“His goal is to kill Evil Queen. I tried drafting a basic mental picture. It seems he got what he wants, and now that he has what he wants, he left.”</p>
<p>When Benukiz died in Louisiana, Narsiel and Vanessa came all the way to Odelia. Evil Queen’s protection has become weak.</p>
<p>“We’ve met by chance, but it looks like he wanted to distract you. Look look. Isn’t your mother alone as a result?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stopped repressing his original nature. He had a fairly serious personality when he was a human, but he started to be faithful to his instincts when he became a mutant.</p>
<p>“Hah! A human killing our mother? A mere human?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if he is a human or a mutant either. I just know his goal.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care what species he is. Mother is great! Everything is a trivial insect in front of her. He’ll be crushed into a handful of dust.”</p>
<p>“Try thinking if you have a brain. Benukiz died shamefully like Odelia, right? I can tell by the way you’re talking about it. There’s no way she’s weak since she’s your sister. That must mean the opponent had that much strength, right?”</p>
<p>Vanessa’s eyes narrow as she listens. They’re discussing the opponent’s strength?</p>
<p>“I hope he leaves her injured if he can’t manage to kill her.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean why? I intend on killing you two here and then going to slice her up.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>As soon as he spoke, he pulled out Hades and jumped forward. The scene has already been set. All that’s left is to kill them.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang bang bang bang!</p>
<p>The middle of Austin. Unrecognizable figures keep colliding. Each time they collide, the atmosphere changes. The sky falls and the ground is turned over. That is how incredible the aftermath is.</p>
<p>Everything near the point of collision is crushed pitifully. Everything, whether it is a building or a car. The only things that are fine are themselves. The battle is 2 against 1 – 2 are focusing their attacks against 1. On top of that, it looks like 2 strong mutants against a weak looking human.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is wearing a fully remodeled battlesuit, and reaches almost 2.5m in size. It is not a small size, but he looks smaller than a child compared to Narsiel and Vanessa. It is a difference that must be taken into account in the fight.</p>
<p>The 2 mutants, Narsiel in particular is twice as large as Vanessa, are considered medium sized mutants. Their enormous size did not make Cha Jun Sung back off. If he were to be scared off by their size in the first place, he would have surrendered to Odelia as well. Physical appearances are not indicative of their ability to fight.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung used his petite size to bring a battle of speed. The ability to overhead a battlesuit, it is one of the Overbooster’s strong points.</p>
<p>There is no way to predict the result of the battle. It is not visible which side is at an advantage and which is at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>‘I’m going to go crazy.’</p>
<p>With attacks coming from everywhere, the world he sees from the battlesuit is dizzying. There is no comparison to when he was going up against Odelia. They are easily stronger by half.</p>
<p>The more annoying thing is that two of them are coming at him. Just because there are two of them does not mean that there is twice the pressure. It may be due to the fact that they are sisters, but they are well coordinated. Narsiel takes Cha Jun Sung’s attacks with her massive body, and Vanessa skillfully hits and falls back.</p>
<p>If he gets one back, the other comes in. They are not an easy opponent because he cannot win with one attack.</p>
<p>The battle method Narsiel and Vanessa are using against Cha Jun Sung is what they can do to take on a single opponent two against one.</p>
<p>He is just one person, so the pressure is indescribable.</p>
<p>That is why it feels like he is going up against three and not two. They know each other well, so they compensate for the other’s lacking aspects.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 207</p>
<p>Narsiel waves her hand blade horizontally. She is aiming for Cha Jun Sung’s neck and chest. Even if she gets him, she couldn’t kill him with one blow. Cha Jun Sung maximized his armor’s strength, and he is maintaining the energy barrier. The Overmode is in 70% activation.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung ducked to avoid the attack, and shot up to the sky with his Overbooster. He flew up about 20m before reversing the booster and falling again. He is holding Hades behind his back with both arms, and its booster turns on.</p>
<p>Diversion. His target is Narsiel, who is slower than Vanessa. He is so fast that he thought he would be able to get in a knife wound.</p>
<p>Hades cut through 4 of Narsiel’s 12 arms. If he just cuts through a little more, it looks like he could cut through the remaining 2 as well.</p>
<p>A sharp attack. A sharp thorn with a white base pierces through the energy barrier. Fortunately, he slowed down and avoided it on time.</p>
<p>The bone attack is a characteristic of hers, not something she got from Evil Queen. It is just a snippet, so there is no way to know what it is.</p>
<p>Tatat!</p>
<p>As soon as Cha Jun Sung avoided the thorn, the exhaust stopped and distance formed between them.</p>
<p>He almost ran into trouble by trying to go for flesh and bones from the beginning of their battle. Those two want his life, not his flesh. So they take gains and retreat without being greedy. It is not a situation where he can end it with one blow like with Odelia.</p>
<p>“You have the ability to kill Odelia.”</p>
<p>“The one who went to Evil Queen is stronger than me. Whatever. We’ll just die together.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung provokes Narsiel and Vanessa. It only half worked. They are worried about their mother, Evil Queen, but they also believe in her. Just as Red Eye thinks of Black Demon as a god, Narsiel and Vanessa see Evil Queen as a mountain that will not bow to anyone.</p>
<p>‘Does it not work? Vanessa is worrying. She won’t show her strength.’</p>
<p>Vanessa does not come to the front, and only supports her sister. Narsiel is the power. Her battle style and patterns are generally the same as in the virtual version. But just because he knows her patterns does not mean something strong becomes weak, so it would have taken more time than with Odelia even if they had been fighting one-on-one.</p>
<p>She has the power of a lion resembling 4-legged beast, but she has 12 arms that act as legs. Level 8-s are all unique in appearance.</p>
<p>Vanessa is a little over 5m tall. A gray hide covers her body as if a female body is wearing tights. Her face is bizarre, but it is bearable to look at. Her sharp arms and legs are bent like scythes, and are her main means of attack.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stays alert with Hades, and skims Vanessa. She has awakened. Being awakened means that there will be no further changes to her physical appearance.</p>
<p>He was unsure of the source of the hidden strength, but he can guess.</p>
<p>Either she becomes firm in order to block the opponent’s attack, or she becomes so fast the opponent cannot see her, or she becomes so sharp she can pierce through barriers.</p>
<p>A triplex is the most important thing to a mutant.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung did not activate his Overmode 100% either. It does not seem like Vanessa will overcome the Overmode, but there is a way if she does happen to get over it.</p>
<p>Becoming a mutant on Narsiel’s mutation. He does not know how much Odin figured out, but he will reveal everything if he is wrong. The power being consumed now is overwhelmingly high. Cha Jun Sung’s power is just from maintaining the human body while strengthening it.</p>
<p>Even if he loses to Narsiel and Vanessa in this state, it is just his shell that has lost and not his person. He will hide as much as his enemy hides.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>“Human. You know what that is, right?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I wouldn’t tell you even if I did, so don’t ask me you bastard.”</p>
<p>The Heavy Gravity crying loudly in the sky. Odin said that it is not a weapon that can be summoned for long, but it has already been over 5 hours.</p>
<p>He does not know if the gravity field is still in effect. He has not tried to escape the battle region and he has not tried to attack the Heavy Gravity.</p>
<p>He cannot pay attention to something else when he has two powerful level 8-s in front of him.</p>
<p>Odin left the battle to Cha Jun Sung and searched for a way to break through this situation. They are both doing their best in their respective fields.</p>
<p>‘Why is this guy so quiet? He hasn’t spoken for months now.’</p>
<p>He is talking about the other entity, the Oriax. Recently, ever since he met Black Demon, the Oriax began to talk less and one day just disappeared.</p>
<p>He won’t respond even when Cha Jun Sung tries to reach out. If there was a problem in his body, the Oriax could just communicate what it is but he is just quiet.</p>
<p>The more surprising thing is that Cha Jun Sung is gradually forgetting about the Oriax. He does look for the Oriax, but it feels like it’d be okay even if the Oriax isn’t there when he’s looking for it.</p>
<p>Truthfully, he had regained control over his own body while the Oriax is a gate crasher that butt in one day, a mutant.</p>
<p>If the Oriax disappears for whatever reason, Cha Jun Sung will go back to normal when he was a normal person with one personality and body. The only thing that bothered him a little was that he cannot become a human if the Oriax does not separate itself. He does not know how to separate it on his own.</p>
<p>These days however, he has the thought that it isn’t so bad to live as a mutant either. There are no disadvantages. There are only advantages. He is starting to take on the personality of a mutant without realizing it.</p>
<p>The kind of personality to see something to an end once it is started. If Black Demon is another version of himself existing in this world, doesn’t that mean that he himself could become level 9 as well?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung grazes the ground with Hades. The resting period is over. He has no intention on running away anyway, but he can’t do so as long as the Heavy Gravity is here.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Click!</p>
<p>Hundreds of cameras on the Heavy Gravity either filmed or took pictures of the battle between Cha Jun Sung and level 8-s.</p>
<p>The filming has been going on since the beginning of battle until now, even though half a day has passed.</p>
<p>A crack similar to the one that formed when the Heavy Gravity was first summoned is forming behind it. It is still small, but it is getting bigger.</p>
<p>It lasted longer than Odin had calculated, but it was proof that it was reaching the limit of its summon time. The gravity field nearby blinks.</p>
<p>That was not the only change. The gravity field seen at a wider range is fading. Cha Jun Sung and Narsiel’s group did not know this.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung approached Vanessa and head butts her. She is twice as big as he is, but the battlesuit flung her away. Vanessa’s body gets buried deep in a building. Cha Jun Sung turns on the Overbooster and follows her. His speed is faster than flying.</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>Narsiel smashes the building. She cannot go in because she is so large. Cha Jun Sung attacked again while Vanessa was trying to regain her balance. This is his chance. Vanessa has been separated from Narsiel. Just attack? He uses all power. A thunderous sound comes from his battlesuit.</p>
<p>“This is something a little different, since it’s an attack to make sure I kill you.”</p>
<p>The entire Overbooster turns on. His body twists and is about to lose control. It is not a skill that Cha Jun Sung can maintain consistently. If he mistakes the booster output by even 0.1%, it becomes impossible for him to stand. He needs to gear everything to keep balance in focus.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s best one-shot attack is drawing his sword. It can deliver a deathblow with a burst from the booster. What if he could do this dozens, hundreds of times?</p>
<p>The air is divided. Once? It is hundreds of times. Vanessa’s eyes open wide because of the chilling wind pressure created from Cha Jun Sung and Hades.</p>
<p>This is completely different attack from what she had seen so far. As mentioned before, it is an attack meant to kill no matter what. What should she do? She needs to find a way to survive.</p>
<p>‘I’m too slow to avoid it. My shell won’t be able to withstand it to block it.’</p>
<p>Narsiel is entering late from outside, but she is a few beats too late. Her eerie enemy’s teeth will arrive first.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s face is covered by his helmet, but he does not doubt his victory.</p>
<p>The battlesuit’s energy is at 30%. It was a difficult fight. He knew Vanessa is hiding her strength, but he can just kill her before she uses it. If he kills Vanessa now and then kills Narsiel who will be left alone, he can just barely block his battlesuit’s blackout.</p>
<p>Vanessa’s body is cut up into pieces. Her arm, her leg, her body.</p>
<p>“Ugh! You’re, you’re the third.”</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>“Seeing… Seeing my other face!”</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>

<p>Chapter 208</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had been cutting her up when he was hit by something and flung away. Looking around, Vanessa’s body was reconstructing quickly. The thing that hit him was a tail that had come from her rear. A long tail that looked like hundreds of arrowheads entwined together had hit the stomach of his battlesuit.</p>
<p>Kya!</p>
<p>Vanessa’s body shrinks. She grew smaller and smaller until she was almost Cha Jun Sung’s size.</p>
<p>He cannot see her clearly because strange chunks of flesh cover the surface, but he can tell that she is becoming optimized for battle.</p>
<p>“Is this Two-Faced Vanessa…..”</p>
<p>It is an incredible aura. A murderous spirit explodes. It soared so much his skin started to crawl. She was supposed to be the strongest of the 4 sisters. Is this what that meant?</p>
<p>The chunks of flesh are taking on a clear shape. It is a bizarre sight – white bones are constructing an exoskeleton. Vanessa calls this her true armor.</p>
<p>‘This will be a bother.’</p>
<p>The armor’s skeleton is tight. He’ll need to try to know, but it looks like he could jab through a certain amount but he could also get stuck before reaching the main body.</p>
<p>The sword is specialized to cut. That means it could cut Cha Jun Sung as well. It is a big handicap that he cannot use it freely.</p>
<p>Inside the completed armor, Vanessa is made of something like a sticky liquid as she watches Cha Jun Sung. The left and right side of her face look different. The left side is calm and looks like the normal Vanessa, but the right shows the original atrocity of a mutant. That must be why she’s said to have two faces.</p>
<p>“Secondary awakening…..”</p>
<p>“I’ve never shown this to anyone other than my mother and father. Not even my sisters.”</p>
<p>This seemed to be the truth. Narsiel is also surprised by Vanessa’s sudden change. She had heard about it, but this is the first time she is seeing it as well.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was floating in the air when he turned off the Overbooster and settled on the ground. He comes in front of the building Vanessa had been buried in, and looks down.</p>
<p>They are 50-60m away from each other. It is too far to attack bare-bodied without firearms, but that is only applicable to ordinary creatures. Cha Jun Sung and Vanessa could cover the distance in less than 1 second. The same goes for Narsiel.</p>
<p>“Va – Vanessa.”</p>
<p>“Stand back, since you can get swept into it too.”</p>
<p>Narsiel did not argue, and fell back far away from the battlefield. Cha Jun Sung thought that he was at a disadvantage.</p>
<p>The key is how strong Vanessa had become. Is she level 9 now because she awakened while a level 8? If that’s right, even one-on-one is hard. He isn’t confident he’ll be able to maintain his battlesuit. Mutant strength will be lessened incredibly as well. It is too much for him to fight Narsiel in that state.</p>
<p>“Odin. Why isn’t a special mission being activated? Say something.”</p>
<p>[For a special mission to be applied, those at the top need to do it, but it was blocked when everything was stopped.]</p>
<p>It would be helpful if he could tell how many reward points he would get for Vanessa or if he could know the mission description, but they are hiding away and don’t look like they want to show themselves. Odin tried connecting and hacking, but the firewall is too strong. He can understand. If the 2nd officer is the mastermind of this incident, Odin can never break through it with his power.</p>
<p>[Huh?]</p>
<p>“Why? What is it?”</p>
<p>[The firewall is fading. It means the Heavy Gravity’s summon time is almost up. Right now! Time – we need time!]</p>
<p>The gravity field outside blinked and showed its limits inside as well. It was starting to show explicitly.</p>
<p>Odin focused on his work again. The atmosphere feels like he should not get in the way. Reclaiming a Lifer’s rights was more important than the battle.</p>
<p>The ground of the building that Vanessa is standing on cracks. It felt like it might flood in at any moment. She had become smaller in size, but she had become much more intimidating. Narsiel released her awakened state and was standing by, resting. Her recovery will be fast because he had not been able to injure her.</p>
<p>‘Remaining energy….. 28%.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung thought of the rapid charger in his space compression bag.</p>
<p>If he plugs one in, he can charge about 15% energy in a short period of time. He can plug it in when he’s replacing it, but it’s not as easy as it sounds. It can fall out if they fight too wildly. On top of that, if Vanessa realizes that the device is his battlesuit’s source of power, she will try to block it.</p>
<p>He will watch the situation and charge at the right time. It is too early to take the battlesuit off. This shell is stronger than Cha Jun Sung as a mutant. Vanessa’s image from the battlesuit became hazy and all of a sudden, she was right in front of him. At this rate, it might as well be teleportation.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>As if expecting it, Hades came out of the scabbard before Vanessa appeared. Vanessa had been trying to take the offensive, but was instead in a situation that could be reversed.</p>
<p>Vanessa avoided Hades by a hair. The speed of sound – the interval is short.</p>
<p>“You’re slow.”</p>
<p>“Damn it!”</p>
<p>There isn’t enough time to recover Hades. Cha Jun Sung looks down. A hand blade resembling a scythe is approaching his stomach area. Cha Jun Sung fell back with his reverse booster. The range is small because Vanessa wrapped her tail around his body. He had no choice but to hit the blade with his knee.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>There is nothing heavier than a man’s pride. Cha Jun Sung’s anger rose from this mocking tone, creating a close range battle.</p>
<p>Neither Cha Jun Sung nor Vanessa did not create distance greater than 3m between them. Cracks formed in his battlesuit and her armor, but they did not pay it any mind and kept facing off. They are going head to head one-on-one – no – Cha Jun Sung is at a slight disadvantage.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had been in a position of offense when he changed Hades’ direction and turned into a position of defense. Vanessa was freely brandishing both her hands as scythes.</p>
<p>Entirely different attacks came in from the left and right sides. The battlesuit’s system calculates the route of both attacks. The hologram is dizzying. There is only one opponent, but it feels like he is fighting two.</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was being pushed back when a few big hits came in. Her scythe cut through his energy barrier and destroyed the battlesuit’s outer armor. Her tail digs into this aperture. It becomes raised like a knife, following the path created by her scythe to reach Cha Jun Sung’s chest.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung grabs hold of the tail embedded in his chest, and cuts it with Hades. The tail quickly regenerates and cuts his left hand, one of the hands holding onto Hades. The left arm parts of his battlesuit and his arm roll on the ground.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung ignores his left arm and penetrates through an empty space in her armor.</p>
<p>Hades pierces Vanessa’s hip. The two of them are basically leaning on each other. They are so close to each other that they can feel the other’s breath.</p>
<p>“My strength is almost 80% that of my mother’s. Someone like you couldn’t kill my mother, much less me. The one you spoke of will end up like this as well.”</p>
<p>Drip drip.</p>
<p>Red blood seeps from the part that has been cut off. Cha Jun Sung and Vanessa each gave each other a hard hit, but Cha Jun Sung is the one who had lasting damage.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung speaks at a volume so low only an ant could hear. It was like a child murmuring, but Vanessa heard clearly.</p>
<p>“I thought you were quiet, but you talk too much.”</p>
<p>His arm regenerates. It is black and thick, and covered in muscle. It is Cha Jun Sung’s mutant arm, not fitting with the battlesuit.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung grabs hold of Vanessa’s face and runs.</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>He slams her on the ground as if she is an object and scrapes her along, even smashing into buildings without stopping.</p>
<p>Vanessa struggles as she attacks Cha Jun Sung with her scythes and tail. But his weak energy barrier and outer armor reduce the impact. She even tried to aim for the part of his battlesuit that is broken, but there was rapid regeneration inside. The outside is a battlesuit, but the inside is a mutant.</p>
<p>[You can’t! You need to stop! The gravity field has not disappeared!]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung did not stop even at Odin’s warning. He has not gone crazy like he did before, but the madness of the battle stimulates his mutant instincts.</p>
<p>If Vanessa gets out, they need to face off again. He’ll push her in one go.</p>
<p>He can see the blinking gravity field ahead of them. Cha Jun Sung ignored it and kept going. He knows what will happen if he goes through that.</p>
<p>[Prepare ejection. Countdown to crash: 10, 9, 8.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 209</p>
<p>Odin prepared the PDA’s ejection. Cha Jun Sung and Vanessa might be able to withstand the pressure of gravity, but the PDA will be destroyed the second it makes contact. Fortunately, there is no need to worry that he will be separated from Cha Jun Sung as happened in Public Underground.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s EEG shown on the battlesuit is normal. He does not seem to be in his right mind, but the readings show that he is behaving like this while in his right mind.</p>
<p>The first was Vanessa. He has his left arm stretched out in front of him, so Vanessa will inevitably be exposed to the gravity field first.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>White dust comes from her armor and breaks into several pieces. The liquid and form resembling Vanessa that were behind protected by the armor become distorted. Vanessa doesn’t know what the gravity field is or why it was formed, but she cannot move a single finger or toe under its horrible pressure.</p>
<p>That is how Vanessa got through the gravity field. All she had done was to go through a transparent veil, but her healthy body had become like a rag. Next was Cha Jun Sung. His left arm holding Vanessa’s face had looked like it was made of steel, but became wrinkly like that of an old man’s.</p>
<p>His muscles, flesh, and bones become extremely compacted by the gravity and become useless pieces of flesh. It would be easier to just cut it off and regenerate.</p>
<p>1 second – the time left until ejection keeps growing smaller. Cha Jun Sung’s arm and battlesuit are destroyed sequentially within that time.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>When his arm got close to the wind pressure of the gravity field, it completely disappeared into the gate opened in the Heavy Gravity. The heavy pressure that had been squeezing Cha Jun Sung felt washed away. But only the pressure had gone, and the traces were still left clearly on his body.</p>
<p>The battlesuit splits in large sections like dried land, and falls from his body. The shell breaks down and Cha Jun Sung’s bare body is exposed. The only defense he is now wearing is a thin set of impact tights.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung?]</p>
<p>Odin cannot speak through the helmet, so he spoke through the PDA.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung let out black smoke and stands up. His wounds are less debilitating than Vanessa. His battlesuit absorbed most of the impact.</p>
<p>‘I can’t.’</p>
<p>He wants to go into his awakened state, but he stopped himself. It would be stupid to waste precious strength now when it is difficult to recharge. Vanessa and Narsiel are alive.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung takes the battlesuit part on his right arm off, and puts his PDA on his wrist like when he was just a beginner. He can’t remember how long it’s been since he’s worn it like this.</p>
<p>Cough!</p>
<p>“What… is this…..”</p>
<p>Vanessa coughs up blood. This was like lightning for her. It was an incredible hit from out of nowhere, in the most unbelievable way. Her balance crumbled in one hit.</p>
<p>He picked up Hades. Even without awakening, he has the strength of a stage 10 modification. This body is as powerful as a level 6 or 7.</p>
<p>“A special mission is far away, right? If I kill her now, I won’t be able to get the points, will I?”</p>
<p>If the special mission isn’t activated, he might not be able to get the reward points or – if he’s super unlucky – even the basic mutant points.</p>
<p>He doesn’t need them that badly, but he’d gone through hell. He won’t work for nothing. It isn’t just millions or tens of millions. It’s hundreds of millions. He needs to get those points.</p>
<p>[The block has been lifted for a moment. I am contacting the authorities.]</p>
<p>“Let’s end–!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was about to stab Vanessa when he suddenly stopped and rolled his body.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A giant palm so large it could crush a human, slammed down where he had been standing. It was Narsiel, who had been standing back.</p>
<p>“Vanessa!”</p>
<p>“I need… time to rest. Narsiel… you take him for a few hours.”</p>
<p>Vanessa’s awakened state automatically becomes released. Perhaps because Evil Queen is a mutant created from a human, Vanessa also has the image of a human.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looked back and forth between Vanessa and Narsiel, and thought carefully.</p>
<p>He healed his wounds in a half awakened state, but he is not completely back to normal. He used 50% of his strength inside the battlesuit and while withstanding the gravity field.</p>
<p>The situation was not bad, but it wasn’t good either.</p>
<p>‘I need to overdo myself if I want to kill Narsiel. And then Vanessa?’</p>
<p>Narsiel is also a top level 8 mutant. There is no way she’ll be easy even if he has wounded her, and there are no Lifers around to ask for help from.</p>
<p>He’ll have to figure it out alone. And then will he have the strength left to take care of Vanessa, who will have somehow recovered her strength while resting?</p>
<p>He might be able to, and he might barely get out. It is a rotation. It’s laughable to even say it, but it’s unfair that he needs to go between two enemies as if they were a tag team.</p>
<p>“Well, since it doesn’t get resolved just by complaining.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung dropped Hades to the ground.</p>
<p>Narsiel was puzzled when he threw his weapon away, but did not let down her guard. The opponent looks like human, but is a mutant.</p>
<p>[Level A special mission The King’s Blood activated! Since this is unlike systems in existing missions in that there are two mutants, the goals are divided into two.]</p>
<p>Confronting Narsiel.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung leisurely pulled up the hologram on his PDA, and checked the new mission description.</p>
<p>[Level A Special Mission: The King’s Blood]</p>
<p>– Goal: Attainment</p>
<p>– Description: Get rid of Evil Queen and Bon Lord’s first daughter Narsiel, and second daughter and the vessel of Disasters Two-Faced Vanessa!</p>
<p>– Special Note: This is a mission where partial completion is possible.</p>
<p>Death of Narsiel: 2,000,000,000 points</p>
<p>Death of Vanessa: 5,000,000,000 points</p>
<p>Death of both: 10,000,000,000 points and lucky box. If you kill Vanessa, a level A advancement mission will be applied, and you will be able to open level S.</p>
<p>Strange for a level A, the description is simple. This is normal. There is no reason to be long-winded about it. All he has to do is kill them.</p>
<p>He gets 2 billion with Narsiel and 5 billion with Vanessa since she is nearly a level 9. A complete level 9 will be worth much more.</p>
<p>And if he kills both, he’ll get an advance mission. The start is hard, but the field is pretty much set with this.</p>
<p>“Odin. What do you think will happen to me now?”</p>
<p>He’s been found out as a mutant.</p>
<p>When the authorities took a sample from him before, he had not been contacted in any particular way. Cha Jun Sung forgot about it as well, but he was sure it would become bothersome.</p>
<p>[I do not have anything to say on the matter because it will be something for the authorities to decide on, but I will do my best to see that Lifer Cha Jun Sung is not adversely affected.]</p>
<p>Even if there was a problem in Cha Jun Sung’s body, what the 2nd officer did went too far. Full intervention isn’t something that the General Manager gave permission for. This is justification for Odin to go against his superior’s commands and take Cha Jun Sung’s side. At the minimum, they will not be blocked from returning.</p>
<p>“Wow! That’s the first welcome thing I’ve heard from you.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took off the PDA and put it down lightly next to Hades.</p>
<p>He cannot lose it. He needs to protect it from the battle that is about to happen.</p>
<p>His impact tights did not just rip, they exploded. Cha Jun Sung’s body rapidly swelled in size and became as tall as Narsiel.</p>
<p>Narsiel took several steps backwards because of the intimidation coming from this black demon. Vanessa, who was unable to fight, had already retreated from the battlefield. Cha Jun Sung’s 9 eyes take in what is in front of him, to the left, and to the right of him. He will of course kill Narsiel, but he cannot lose Vanessa either.</p>
<p>“It’s the 2nd act.”</p>
<p>Now, it is a battle between monsters. Not as Lifer Cha Jun Sung, but another mutant, Cha Jun Sung as the Black Lord of a different world.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 210</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung felt extreme fatigue. He has been in constant battle, starting with Odelia to Vanessa and Narsiel.</p>
<p>His mind and body are depleted.</p>
<p>He’s so tired he could just lay down right now, but he doesn’t stop fighting.</p>
<p>The second he stops, that cunning and sinister Narsiel’s attack will destroy his nucleus.</p>
<p>What can he do since he doesn’t want to die?</p>
<p>He has no choice but to fight.</p>
<p>And another reason to keep fighting is that this drag of a fight will finally end with this.</p>
<p>He transformed his left arm to resemble Hades. If only he could slice Narsiel’s upper and lower body in half!</p>
<p>Narsiel has 6 arms on her left and 6 on her right for a total of 12. He cut off a few while fighting in his battlesuit, but they regenerated and mutant Cha Jun Sung needs to fight against all 12 again.</p>
<p>At the end of an intense fight, he cut off 10. There are 2 left.</p>
<p>Those 2 arms cut Cha Jun Sung’s right arm and right leg at the same time. He doesn’t care about his arm, but his balance is off because of the leg. Rather than losing mobility, it was more of a disadvantage to lose his stability.</p>
<p>“I – I won! I won!”</p>
<p>“You’re delusional.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s tail split into hundreds of pieces and bind up Narsiel. She cannot move because they have wrapped around her entire body like compression bandage. She was wrapped up so severely that she looked like a mummy.</p>
<p>“Let me go!”</p>
<p>“Die.”</p>
<p>He brought down his left arm’s weapon. Cha Jun Sung’s tail and Narsiel both get split in two. She’s split from her shoulder to her torso.</p>
<p>They’re both so tired neither of them are capable of rapid regeneration. Regeneration might somehow be possible if he gathers all the strength left in his body, but even that will take time.</p>
<p>He needs to kill the enemy. He needs to drive through while he can still kill her. He cannot give her time to regenerate and regain strength.</p>
<p>He had been moving elaborately before, but is now moving like a beast. Cha Jun Sung sliced up Narsiel’s body as if butchering meat.</p>
<p>There is a sweet taste in his mouth.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung did not regenerate his right arm and leg. It is much more important to kill Narsiel.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung dissects Narsiel, looking for her nucleus.</p>
<p>Ordinary mutants don’t have a distinct nucleus. If major organs like their brains and hearts are damaged, they die just like humans.</p>
<p>But beyond level 7 – especially at level 8 – they form a separate lump that is special like their source, and that is the nucleus.</p>
<p>There is a good chance that level 8-s can die if something goes wrong with their brains or hearts as well.</p>
<p>He won’t know unless this happens to him, but there is a peculiar object that can regenerate his brain and heart if something happen to them. That’s what Beholder said. That’s why he needs to be sure to find and destroy the nucleus in level 7 through 9-s. That’s the surest way of killing a mutant.</p>
<p>A grey, round organ comes out in Cha Jun Sung’s hand.</p>
<p>The nucleus.</p>
<p>The life goes out of Narsiel’s eyes as she watches this.</p>
<p>“How could I… In a place like this…”</p>
<p>“I’ll send you off one by one. Don’t worry. I’ll take this.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung eats Narsiel’s nucleus.</p>
<p>It is just a temporary measure, but this will help recharge his nutrients. Right now, he’s grateful for even this much. It’s disgusting but it tastes pretty good, whether that’s because he’s a mutant or because it fits his appetite. The effects of eating the nucleus appeared only minutes after.</p>
<p>His right arm and leg regenerate and the wounds all over his body heal.</p>
<p>Narsiel’s nucleus isn’t Cha Jun Sung’s. He might be able to control it if he was healthy, but he lost agency when he became a mess of injuries.</p>
<p>That was the only role the nucleus played. He is satisfied with the results.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s body shrinks. He has released his awakened state.</p>
<p>He’s gone back to human form of his own will and not because he was forced to. This is to leave enough strength to take on Vanessa in his human form. Simply maintaining an awakened state consumes a lot of energy.</p>
<p>“This is so hard.”</p>
<p>He is being sincere.</p>
<p>He’s so tired he wouldn’t be able to express it in words.</p>
<p>He went to where he had left his PDA and put it back on his wrist. He also picked up Hades, which had been next to it.</p>
<p>[You have killed Evil Queen’s first daughter, Narsiel. You have earned 27 trillion points and 5 trillion 40 million advance points. You have completed part of the mission. You have earned 20 trillion points with Narsiel’s death.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung realized that the mutant and reward points for level 8 mutants are similar after killing Odelia and Narsiel.</p>
<p>The mutant points were slightly more than reward points.</p>
<p>With this formula, Vanessa’s reward points must amount to 50 or 60 trillion. An obstacle is gone. He can now go kill Vanessa too.</p>
<p>The last time Cha Jun Sung saw Vanessa was 30 minutes ago. As the battle grew fierce, he hadn’t been able to focus his attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>He wants to take his space compression bag as well, but it is too far away. He dropped it when he was struggling with his body as he dragged Vanessa through the gravity field. He’ll waste time if he goes all the way just to come back.</p>
<p>“She’s not here? Did she run away when her big sister was fighting? Tsk tsk! Odin, can you look for her location with the Universe Eye? She wouldn’t have been able to get far, would she?”</p>
<p>[I did find her… but I do not suggest you chase after her.]</p>
<p>“Let’s hear it.”</p>
<p>[She is northeast bound at about 40km distance, and getting further away. She has recovered a relative amount while resting.] [Lifer Cha Jun Sung, not only will chasing after her be hard with your current body state but even after you catch up to her, there is a risk in sustaining yourself in a battle.]</p>
<p>Does this mean he should let her go?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung thought about it and went back to where his space compression bag is. He spoke as he ran.</p>
<p>“Not even if I use the extra battlesuit in my space compression bag?”</p>
<p>Since it is an extra, it is just the basic battlesuit that can be purchased in a level C store. It is the basic type with the power of level 5. He may not benefit from it, but it will at least help him save what little energy he has left.</p>
<p>[43km, 44km. Once you start the chase, you will be more than 45km away from her. Even if you use the battlesuit booster, there is a limit in the basic form.]</p>
<p>He would only be able to catch up if Vanessa stops. But wouldn’t she keep running for her life?</p>
<p>45km only sounds like a simple number.</p>
<p>Odin is telling him to keep what will come after in mind. Quitting a mission is up to the Lifer, and helpers cannot interfere.</p>
<p>“Ugh! It’s an advance. Fine.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took Odin’s advice. He can just ignore it if he wants to, but it makes sense. There isn’t anything he wants to gain by overdoing it.</p>
<p>“Huh? Where’d it go?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung arrived where he had dropped his space compression bag, and looked around. He was sure he had left it around here, but he doesn’t see it.</p>
<p>[Searching Lifer Cha Jun Sung’s location saved in space compression bag.]</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>[This is a nonexistent location. Nonexistent… location?]</p>
<p>“No! You know how much the stuff in there is worth? It’s over 100 trillion!”</p>
<p>Odin searched the location, but he cannot find the space compression bag. It’s a treasure chest with items worth 100 trillion points.</p>
<p>Is it another system error?</p>
<p>It has a recognition function because it is a level A space compression bag, so it would be of no use to other people. But more than that, why can’t he find it?</p>
<p>“This has to be a dream!”</p>
<p>He earned a tremendous amount of points after killing Odelia and Narsiel, but it is all meaningless if he loses that bag.</p>
<p>On top of that, he needs to find the bag no matter what because of the Universe Eye, an item he bought in the level S store.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung will search through Austin.</p>
<p>Naked.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 211</p>
<p>In the open air.</p>
<p>So high the buildings below just look like a dark mass and the clouds are at eye-level.</p>
<p>Someone is looking down at a naked Cha Jun Sung. They’re so far apart that it is impossible to distinguish, but the battlesuit made this possible. The booster is keeping the wearer’s balance at minimal output. There is nowhere to rest in the air, but there is no shakiness as if standing on ground.</p>
<p>“Why is a guy who should still be wandering around in level B, here?”</p>
<p>An unknown presence. The future Cha Jun Sung is looking at the present Cha Jun Sung. He has been watching from beginning to end, and he still cannot understand.</p>
<p>Let’s say he was able to get through the hellish level B advance mission. If so, he needs to show the abilities of a level A Lifer. But that’s the ability of a level S Lifer, though he does fall short a bit because of his gear.</p>
<p>The worst part is that he is going the path of Black Demon, when he should be on the path of a Lifer. And it’s funny that it’s just half at that.</p>
<p>If he had been a true Black Demon with level 9 strength, he would have been able to easily kill Narsiel and Vanessa even if they teamed up against him.</p>
<p>He’s in a state where he is neither a complete Lifer or mutant. It seems like the notebook has had a strange influence.</p>
<p>He doesn’t look negatively at it. At the least, this Cha Jun Sung isn’t going on the same path he did. If they had the same future, there would have been no meaning to his going back in time.</p>
<p>“Did he get the card and open the store? I guess that could be possible. But how did he become a mutant? Whatever. It’s enough that it’s made him stronger.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung murmured to himself in question.</p>
<p>It isn’t worth worrying about. It can even be seen as a good thing. He has two weapons that other people find hard to have even one of.</p>
<p>As long as there aren’t adverse side effects, it could be helpful in getting him through difficult obstacles.</p>
<p>“He’ll be a little relieved.”</p>
<p>When he first got to North America, he had gone looking for Evil Queen in her home, Washington, but he hadn’t been able to find her. So he had changed his target to the 4 sisters.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is here because of Odelia. After searching through all of North America, the first one he had been able to find was the Corrupt Odelia. He had thought after killing Benukiz that it might take him all of his time to find all of them.</p>
<p>The gears in his head started turning.</p>
<p>He would make the sisters look for him instead of going to look for them himself.</p>
<p>While waiting after he killed Benukiz, Narsiel and Vanessa had appeared.</p>
<p>He had been delighted.</p>
<p>He had thought about taking care of them on the spot, but decided to killed Odelia first. Then he came here.</p>
<p>And when he saw Cha Jun Sung, he watched the battle instead of interfering. He was going to step in if need be since he cannot let Cha Jun Sung die, but he fought well. He can tell just by the way Vanessa ran for her life.</p>
<p>“He wouldn’t have been told I’m here, right? I don’t want to have to come face-to-face with him.”</p>
<p>They may be the same person because they are the present and future, but they each have their separate lives. They will end up meeting if that is their fate, even if he tries to stop it. But that time isn’t now.</p>
<p>“I’ll use this well.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung touches the space compression bag. He had slipped it away during the battle. By the way he’s creating a huge fuss over this, there must be great things inside.</p>
<p>He doesn’t like stealing, but he’s an irregular. He can’t use the store. He needs to fight Evil Queen with what’s given to him. It had taken him a long time to find the 4 sisters because he didn’t have the proper gear. He needs to save everything until the very end when he will need to use everything.</p>
<p>“Odin, can you release the recognition system?”</p>
<p>[There is no reason to release it. The two of you are a 100% match.]</p>
<p>“I just asked because I was bored.”</p>
<p>Woong.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung puts his hand inside the space compression bag.</p>
<p>Other people would have gotten caught with the recognition system and would not have been able to take items out of the bag.</p>
<p>“Wow! He has 4 Universe Eyes. Jackpot! This is a total treasure chest!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung hadn’t been able to bring much along with him when he came to the past. There is a limit to the mass that Odin can bring over with his power.</p>
<p>There is so much of what he needs here. This is what rain at the end of a drought must feel like. The person who lost it will be upset, but he hopes he will understand.</p>
<p>“Anyway. Did that bastard 2nd officer do something at this point?”</p>
<p>The 2nd officer thoroughly bothered Cha Jun Sung with things like summoning the Heavy Gravity. That’s immutable. The 2nd officer’s pattern changed as the future changed, but his ability to piss people off didn’t change at all.</p>
<p>The exact starting point of when Odin had started to go against his superiors was when they began to blatantly persecute Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>The conflict will probably get worse, and it will eventually explode.</p>
<p>[We’ve wasted too much time. At this rate, she’ll have gotten out of the Universe Eye’s range. You only have a 2 minute margin. You need to go.]</p>
<p>Vanessa is using all the remaining strength she has in running away.</p>
<p>She is pretty fast. It’ll become difficult to find her if she gets out of the Universe Eye’s range.</p>
<p>But he needs to take care of this situation. He’s become weaker.</p>
<p>Present Cha Jun Sung has 6 Universe Eye’s out. Future Cha Jun Sung can use these as well. It’s the same concept as the space compression bag.</p>
<p>It feels like he is being a burden in many ways. He will repay that much as well.</p>
<p>“Cheer up. You’re not going to live like me. I’m not going to let that happen.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung activated the Overbooster. Austin is getting farther and farther away. They need to separate without speaking to each other once, but he feels good. Really.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>How could she look so different from when she got here?</p>
<p>Vanessa only has her lower body awakened as she focuses on running away. She doesn’t care if she’s called a coward.</p>
<p>She needs to put as much distance between them as she can while Narsiel is holding him.</p>
<p>She rested a few hours, but she really doesn’t have the strength to recover.</p>
<p>It is impossible to fight Cha Jun Sung with this amount of strength. That would be suicide.</p>
<p>She had hidden her body in her armor and reserved her strength, but her true strength had come out when the armor broke. There is no way to fill in the difference. Narsiel is probably dead now. 3 out of the 4 sisters are dead. She needs to tell her mother, Evil Queen, about this.</p>
<p>“He must be exhausted too, right? There’s no way he has the strength to come after me.”</p>
<p>Even if he has that strength, she’s confident she can avoid getting caught. She can run away as much as he follows. He can’t just shorten the distance between them.</p>
<p>Vanessa’s name Two-Faced isn’t because of her second awakened state, but because of her duplicity. She appears calm on the outside, but she has thirstier instinct than anyone else. A need for survival is included in that instinct.</p>
<p>All living creatures have the common desire not to die, to live.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Vanessa looks up at a sound bursting in the air.</p>
<p>White smoke spreading suddenly in the air. This powder is a phenomenon only seen when an object breaks the speed of sound.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The object falls to the floor. It falls so heavily that the ground cracks like a spider web and debris flies. Amongst the dust, a blue light shines bright.</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“You! You! How!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung waved at her in a friendly manner. Vanessa is astonished.</p>
<p>Does this mean he had spare armor?</p>
<p>It’s a misjudgment. She knows how powerful he is because she has fought against him in his battlesuit while she was still healthy and in her second awakened state.</p>
<p>There was no way for Vanessa to even consider that he might not be the same person.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had no intention on revealing it to her either.</p>
<p>There is only one thing he wants to hear from Vanessa. Where Evil Queen is. He doesn’t care about anything other than that.</p>
<p>“Vanessa, you cute little thing! You two-faced bitch! I’ll let you live if you answer my question. Evil Queen – where is she? Just tell me then. I promise I’ll let you live.”</p>
<p>Those who have more tend to yearn for life more. Vanessa is strong. If she is left alone, she becomes a Disaster level mutant like Evil Queen. They and Bon Lord invade Asia and succeed in killing all of the other Disasters except Black Demon. There’s usually strength in numbers.</p>
<p>The Black Demon that future Cha Jun Sung encountered in Life Mission went missing with Evil Queen and Bon Lord’s alliance, but he presumed he is dead.</p>
<p>This is because there weren’t any missions regarding him in the mission list.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 212</p>
<p>Vanessa killed Red Eye and Dragon. At the time, White Empress had been betrayed by ally Cruel King and they had been engaged in a war of attrition. There had been no way for them to withstand it when they should have been combining their power. They were swept away by the power of North and South America.</p>
<p>While busy in a war against Evil Queen and Bon Lord, Cha Jun Sung had been defeated humiliatingly. The rest of his group were killed in that mission. This place won’t become like that. Black Demon will have formed an alliance with White Queen, and they will have taken care of Cruel King. He had explained it to them for them to understand.</p>
<p>“Hurry up and tell me. Should I just kill you?”</p>
<p>The Overbooster roars. Cha Jun Sung is about to pull out Hades. Vanessa knows by intuition that she’ll die as soon as that gets pulled out.</p>
<p>She can’t avoid that attack with this body. She’ll be split in half with one hit.</p>
<p>“M – Mother is in the eastern region!”</p>
<p>“East? Washington?”</p>
<p>“Pr – probably.”</p>
<p>“This bitch.”</p>
<p>Hades cuts both of Vanessa’s legs. She’s lying. He searched everywhere, but hadn’t been able to find even a hair.</p>
<p>“I looked everywhere there. I’ll give you a last chance. This time, I’ll chop you up and destroy your nucleus.”</p>
<p>Vanessa in withering on the ground. She can’t believe that she’s in such a wretched state when she’s the 2nd strongest in North America.</p>
<p>“Mother is in South America! It’s the truth! I’m not lying!”</p>
<p>“South America?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>
<p>“Why there?”</p>
<p>“That’s – that’s!”</p>
<p>South America? Has she gone to Bon Lord? Why now? Disaster’s don’t leave their regions if they can help it because there’s no reason to leave.</p>
<p>“Is she trying to have another child?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung said it in jest, but Vanessa’s body trembles.</p>
<p>What is this?</p>
<p>This must be the answer.</p>
<p>It’s so ridiculous, he’s speechless. He should give her an award. She isn’t the Queen of Evil, but the Queen of Fertility.</p>
<p>While he was thinking, Vanessa began moving strangely. Cha Jun Sung pretended not to see. She can try if she wants to.</p>
<p>Ping ping ping!</p>
<p>Vanessa’s rib bones comes out. It’s disgusting. They’re raised on both sides like a trap, and it is an attack that can skewer an entire body.</p>
<p>“Ugh. I was going to let you live. Farewell!”</p>
<p>“No – no!”</p>
<p>Hades moves at a high speed and slices Vanessa into hundreds of pieces. The approaching bones are cut and fall to the ground like straw.</p>
<p>She dug her own grave. He hadn’t had the intention of saving her in the first place. He needs to kill a pest like this. This is a shortcut to world peace.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>He took care of the corpse with a super-heated shot, the highest level of heat bombs.</p>
<p>Since he can’t go to South America, he’ll just clean up North America while he’s here. There are a few level 8-s left who are following fertile Evil Queen.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This is the inside of Cha Jun Sung. There is something living in this place so secret and deep that he didn’t even know it existed.</p>
<p>[I’m uneasy… I feel like I might disappear. I’m becoming someone else.]</p>
<p>The Oriax is nervous.</p>
<p>His identity has been growing weaker ever since Cha Jun Sung met Black Demon and he began establishing his own identity.</p>
<p>Even if he wants to get out, the body won’t split as if there are shackles. The Oriax’s part as a mutant is being absorbed as well.</p>
<p>The thing that Beholder bothered – whatever it is – is awakening. It isn’t visible yet, but it is getting stronger little by little. Once the latent cells are completely awakened, he might automatically become a level 9.</p>
<p>He is being consumed. It isn’t the will of Cha Jun Sung or the Oriax. Just as drops of water naturally combine, they are pulling at each other.</p>
<p>The only difference is that the center axis is Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Over time, the two personalities will become one, stabilizing the mind and body. It is a good thing, but not for the party being consumed. The Oriax wants to live. He doesn’t want to disappear like this.</p>
<p>What should he do?</p>
<p>[I’ll crouch. I’ll eat him before he eats me. I’ll hide myself until then.</p>
<p>A body growing stronger. If he can just take over the body, he will be able to surpass all limits of his species and become a being that stands over everything else.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Beep.</p>
<p>A giant door with several obstacles blocking it.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man in a soft white coat is standing in front of the door. He is there to authorize entry.</p>
<p>A tent of light passes over the middle-aged man. Everything related to the man’s body such as height, weight, blood pressure, heart rate, and iris are checked.</p>
<p>[Security level Z. Releasing 7 nested security devices. Project command, Life Mission’s 2nd officer Borteth’s entry has been authorized.]</p>
<p>Borteth walks a silent hallway. All he can see are silver walls and ceiling. It is a straight line like a tunnel.</p>
<p>1 minute at a normal walking pace?</p>
<p>He did not walk for a long time. In that time, the distance would be about 100m.</p>
<p>Wiing!</p>
<p>A dead end. As soon as he arrived, a 2m rectangle formed, and a laser came out of each corner. Those lasers widened the range and wrap around Borteth. This is a type of gate, and the lasers act as a barrier protecting the passenger.</p>
<p>Electricity comes out near the dimension gate, and the space becomes distorted.</p>
<p>Borteth is expressionless. He waited for this phenomenon to end as though used to experiencing it.</p>
<p>When the distortion ended, he was standing in a conference room that looked to be about 300m. Everything he had gone through had been to get here.</p>
<p>“Borteth, you’re here.”</p>
<p>“Sorry I’m late.”</p>
<p>The room is filled with dozens of chairs, but only two people are seated. Borteth sat to the left of the head of the table to make them a total of three.</p>
<p>“Ha ha! You’ve made a mess. To think you used the Heavy Gravity.”</p>
<p>The person sitting across from Borteth, laughs at him.</p>
<p>Gabenu, the 3rd officer. Their numbers are different, but their authority is the same. Thus, Borteth ignored the laughter and mocking.</p>
<p>“It’s nothing you need to worry about.”</p>
<p>“Hah! Don’t talk nonsense. You’re saying that total interference isn’t something to worry about?”</p>
<p>Borteth ignored this again. Truthfully, Gabenu is right. The rule all of the executives decided on was non intervention. He had gone against that.</p>
<p>But people tend to not want to hear negative comments even if they did wrong.</p>
<p>“Borteth.”</p>
<p>“… Yes.”</p>
<p>The person sitting at the head of the table spoke. He spoke a little more politely than he had to Gabenu. This is someone he must do that to.</p>
<p>The general, the person in charge.</p>
<p>Life Mission’s general manager, Jigneon.</p>
<p>He’s the one who made the greatest contribution to Life Mission, from the structure to details. His authority is similar to that of the 2nd and 3rd officers, but he has a few privileges that they don’t have.</p>
<p>“Africa happened because Gabenu and I agreed with your suggestion. But this is different. Explain yourself.”</p>
<p>They interfered with the Lifers’ mission in Africa because they had all agreed to do so. This had allowed them to gather a lot of information.</p>
<p>However, he had decided on his own to use the Heavy Gravity, placed a block on returning from a fairly completed mission, and even interfered with items. It is right that he be reprimanded for using total interference in order to pressure a single Lifer without their permission.</p>
<p>“It was all for testing purposes.”</p>
<p>“I know there are results, since we found out what kind of mutants Cha Jun Sung can fight against as a Lifer, and that he came back as a mutant after disappearing in Public Underground.”</p>
<p>There is a lot that they gained.</p>
<p>They had not been able to find anything weird in the sample they collected from Cha Jun Sung before. It is understandable. He would be able to control his body freely if he had become a mutant, so what wouldn’t he be able to do?</p>
<p>Borteth had said repeatedly that they should collect another sample or threaten him, but Jigneon had been against it.</p>
<p>No matter what doubts they have, there is a thing called timing. Fruit should be picked when ripe. There is a decrease in value if it is picked too early.</p>
<p>Jigneon knows Borteth is the type to disregard the start and process as long as the results are certain.</p>
<p>Results?</p>
<p>They are important.</p>
<p>Even if the start and process were perfect, it is a failure if there are no results.</p>
<p>“Results are good, but you can’t understand why I’m like this?”</p>
<p>“Honestly, no.”</p>
<p>“Once you stray, it’s hard to stop. Why? Because you’ve gotten a taste. The first time is usually the hardest. That’s why the first button always needs to be done right.”</p>
<p>It is the wrong way. Borteth will act on his own again.</p>
<p>The fastest and surest way of getting results by going against the rules set by the executives, is right in front of him. There’s no way he will be able to withstand the seduction.</p>
<p>“E, D, C, B, A, S levels are smooth. Lifers going from level E to B are providing us with a lot of help in our experiment.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung who reached the vertex of existing Lifers has even completed level A.</p>
<p>Jigneon only has one thing he wants to say to Borteth. It’s not to be blinded by ambition, messing up their work.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 213</p>
<p>Allies who can’t be controlled aren’t much different from the enemy. If he pursues just the results, they will be ruined. They need the patience to wait.</p>
<p>Borteth frowns at Jigneon giving him a sermon. He is extremely annoyed, but he cannot ignore him like he did with Gabenu.</p>
<p>“Fine. Let me ask one thing. How were you going to take responsibility if Cha Jun Sung had died? You would have wasted a special sample from our study.”</p>
<p>“Responsibility? What responsibility are you talking about? If he dies, he dies. Don’t we have plenty of Lifers anyway? The 36 Rankers will become level A Lifers soon, too.”</p>
<p>Borteth refuses to listen, so Gabenu sighs. He is so single-minded, only thinking of himself.</p>
<p>Even Gabenu thinks that they need to take Cha Jun Sung all the way. If he dies, they will have lost a level S Lifer, which they aren’t sure they’ll get again.</p>
<p>He may have skipped some steps with the advanced store opening card, but his fighting ability surpasses level A. He has the ability to take on a level A advance mission, so he might as well be called a level S Lifer.</p>
<p>If the 3 officers want to, they can create as many level S and A Lifers as they pleased. They can just release the restrictions on the store like they did with missions. But they don’t have enough items to give out to so many Lifers, so there wouldn’t be use for so many advanced Lifers anyway.</p>
<p>It is like taking an exam while looking at the answer sheet. They cannot experiment with Lifers without differentiation, as if they were products created in a factory.</p>
<p>Life Mission was created as a long term project of experimenting between Lifers and mutants for about 10 years. Not even half that time has passed. They cannot begin to stray from their path already.</p>
<p>“You have no signs of being sorry. Then I’ll ask in another way. Do you admit that you used the Heavy Gravity arbitrarily and forced a Lifer?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“You’ve broken a rule that we created, that you agreed with yourself. With the authority as General Manager, I take you out from experiments for a few months.”</p>
<p>Gabenu was more surprised than Borteth, who had received the punishment. It is just a few months, but he hadn’t expected Jigneon to take Borteth away from the front.</p>
<p>“Be grateful we don’t report this to the top, and reflect on your actions.”</p>
<p>Borteth grinds his teeth. It’s so loud that Jigneon and Gabenu can hear, but he does not disrespect them.</p>
<p>Borteth isn’t such a lightweight as to find fault in position.</p>
<p>“Go. Gabenu and I need to hold our meeting about the rest of the agenda.”</p>
<p>Borteth glares at Jigneon, slightly bows his head, and gets on the dimensional gate. He is the General Manager. He cannot act out of line just because he is angry. He did not even acknowledge Gabenu before leaving.</p>
<p>“Will it be okay? There’s no way he’ll behave with his personality.”</p>
<p>“I don’t think he’ll listen to me either. This is just a strong warning I’m giving him.”</p>
<p>Gabenu spoke respectfully to Jigneon unlike Borteth, and Jigneon also maintained formalities toward him. It means that they respect each other.</p>
<p>Borteth had the ability to participate in the meeting taken away by the General Manager’s authority, but he intends to engage with Life Mission in his own way.</p>
<p>However, he will refrain from acting arbitrarily for the time being since he has been reprimanded.</p>
<p>“Sometimes, it looks like you look out for Cha Jun Sung, Jigneon.”</p>
<p>“Look out for him? That’s not how I would put it, but I guess I would say it’s similar. He’s the one who provides the most information for headquarters. Alright! Let’s move past this. Isn’t there something else that’s important?”</p>
<p>Wiing!</p>
<p>A large hologram shows them North America. They are not looking at the current situation. They are looking at what happened in the past again. They examine the hologram without speaking. It shows someone fighting with Benukiz and killing Vanessa.</p>
<p>But they couldn’t see who they are, as if they were in mosaic. This is proof that they are fooling the satellite’s eye. That is impossible. The satellites installed on Earth are created from their current technology, on an entirely different level from the technology of the old world.</p>
<p>They use this to keep track of mutant locations and construct or reconstruct missions. They can see anything they are looking at clearly.</p>
<p>“There isn’t even an item in the level S store that can help someone avoid the satellites.”</p>
<p>“I’m suspicious about that too.”</p>
<p>They have to watch the Lifers. They wouldn’t have made something like that.</p>
<p>The 3 officers, their scientists, and the helpers did not even touch items that would act at a disadvantage to the system.</p>
<p>“We won’t be able to find this man, will we?”</p>
<p>“No. He’s gone missing ever since he killed Vanessa.”</p>
<p>“This isn’t a matter that we can just move past. From the report… creating this equipment is possible. With our technology, not the technology of Earth.”</p>
<p>Jigneon considered the number of cases, but there isn’t a clear measure.</p>
<p>It seems like they will have to dig into it over time rather than trying to solve it immediately.</p>
<p>This kind of variable isn’t welcome because it isn’t predictable.</p>
<p>“Let’s move on. Next?”</p>
<p>“It’s the type 5226 cocoon that formed in Africa. A level 8 parasite has succeeded in getting into Cruel King’s body, and is developing.”</p>
<p>The hologram changes.</p>
<p>They can see Parasite King’s cocoon. It has been over a year since it became a cocoon, but it still isn’t waking up.</p>
<p>Mutants of various colors gather near the cocoon. There are thousands of them. They have both the purposes of acting as protection and nutrients.</p>
<p>The mutants providing nutrients are mostly blood-sucking insects the size of a human head. They follow the Blood King’s orders and burn their bodies to fill the cocoon’s appetite.</p>
<p>“Which guarding mutant is the strongest?”</p>
<p>“Red Eye and Inferno, Blood King, Beholder. It seems like White Empress and Black Demon predicted the cocoon would be a problem, and sent them out.”</p>
<p>“A Disaster might be difficult for those four, but they will have more power than something similar to Vanessa. It’s the best combination. I can tell they put a lot of thought into it.”</p>
<p>If Red Eye and Inferno, and Blood King take on the close combat encounters while Beholder brings a psychological attack from behind, they are a force to be reckoned with.</p>
<p>On top of that, Blood King has countless armies through Blood Devil. They could push through with volume alone.</p>
<p>“Is that a level 9 if it wakes up?”</p>
<p>“When calculating the virus level, it isn’t as if there is no possibility, but it does seem like it will be difficult for it to become a Disaster. We expect it to be something like Vanessa.”</p>
<p>“Whatever it is, I guess we just have to wait and let time tell.”</p>
<p>“Waiting is our specialty.”</p>
<p>“Huh? So that’s how it sounds.”</p>
<p>“We can solve North America and Africa while we watch Cha Jun Sung’s mutation. There is a lot of mystery. I think it’ll be fun.”</p>
<p>“What about Cha Jun Sung’s sanctions?”</p>
<p>“I think it’d be better if we don’t apply them. Odin is bringing up laws and resisting. Though he has become a mutant, it seems there are no problems with his sanity. What do you think about leaving him alone for now?”</p>
<p>“Alright. There’s an order to things. We have a lot of time, so let’s go slowly.”</p>
<p>Jigneon and Gabenu ended their meeting, boarded the dimensional gate, and went back to their respective domains. They have a ton of work to take care of.</p>
<p>Borteth returns to his laboratory and throws everything within his reach. It would be an appropriate expression to say he turned everything over.</p>
<p>The laboratory is full of quality items though monetary standards are different from those on Earth, but he pays no mind and uses them all to vent his anger. He did not stop with his selfishness and dirty nature until everything was devastated, but he was still fuming.</p>
<p>“Those damn rules! Rules! They need to use all means and methods if they want results! How long must we stay entangled in order and procedure?!”</p>
<p>Even in Borteth’s eyes, Cha Jun Sung is an impressive Lifer. But it doesn’t mean he’s irreplaceable. There are quite a number of Lifers who could take his place.</p>
<p>Life Mission’s virtual version is like a training center for the reality version. It’s a system in which talent can bloom because the reality was created with a foundation.</p>
<p>Luck is necessary in body and battlesuit modifications, but luck is also a skill.</p>
<p>Frankly, Cha Jun Sung skipped advancement with an opening card. He became a level S Lifer with shortcuts. He hadn’t gone through the normal process. Borteth’s stance is that the 36 Rankers can advance as much as Cha Jun Sung has if the officers give them a little help.</p>
<p>He broke the rules with total interference, but he achieved that much in results. What he had earned through Cha Jun Sung wasn’t bad. That’s why he says that it doesn’t matter if Cha Jun Sung dies. There has to be another person with abilities like Cha Jun Sung’s in a planet with a population of billions.</p>
<p>World Federation and Bloody Kingdom are trying level B advancement right now.</p>
<p>They have put completion as their goal at the end of significant sacrifice. There will be a clear separation between winners and losers, but there will be quite an increase in the number of level A Lifers.</p>
<p>“Jigneon and Gabenu – I’m positive they’re working together against me!”</p>
<p>This is the way Borteth sees the world.</p>
<p>What he sees is what he gets. If he sees it from the side, he understands it as from the side. If he sees it backwards, he understands it as backwards. Misled values make him see his bad behavior as justified, and others’ just actions as bad.</p>
<p>“I’m a creator. I’m one of the three creators of Life Mission.”</p>
<p>Creator – it is misleading to say it means God, but it is not wrong.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 214</p>
<p>Creator.</p>
<p>An owner who makes something that was not there before.</p>
<p>Interpreted like this, Borteth is Life Mission’s Creator.</p>
<p>“Since it’s a rule I created, I can get rid of it! I’ll do as I please in the areas I have authority in from now on!”</p>
<p>He won’t do anything obvious like activating the Heavy Gravity. He’ll do enough so Jigneon and Gabenu will acquiesce even when they know. He is tiptoeing, but he is being penalized. He needs to refrain from actions that bring attention to him.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Borteth waves his hand in the air, a satellite installed in a mission region connects with North America, and he can see an active Cha Jun Sung. A managing position like an officer or helper can watch a Lifer’s every move without going through a complicated process.</p>
<p>“A trivial creature…”</p>
<p>Borteth grabs the edge of his desk and the steel rips. The officers are fundamentally strong. They have to be strong.</p>
<p>The officers are the ones who created body modifications and items like the battlesuit.</p>
<p>“Huh. I’ll have to make my own chess piece. One that’ll listen well.”</p>
<p>The satellite’s view changes.</p>
<p>Borteth finds someone conducting a mission in the new view.</p>
<p>He’s perfect.</p>
<p>They’re hard to control if they’re smart. His influence and skill are outstanding, but he needs to be greedy and independent.</p>
<p>Since Jigneon and Gabenu created the monitoring network, he will be able to put good use to him if he plays his cards right.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had lost Vanessa but he had been able to kill Odelia and Narsiel, but he did not go back to reality, and remained in the mission. He has lost a tremendous amount of points with his battlesuit destroyed and his space compression bag gone. He’s scared to even calculate the loss.</p>
<p>It might be a question as to whether he can stay in a mission area with his bare body, but he has already been found out as a mutant. All he needs is the PDA. Cha Jun Sung sweeps through mutant congested areas while awakened as a mutant, wearing his PDA, and holding Hades with his tail.</p>
<p>To mutants, he is a disaster and a nightmare. They lose the will to fight in front of a top level predators’ attack. Their confidence dwindles before they even start. It might seem like a good thing, but it isn’t. He doesn’t have to chase them around if they charge at him, but they all scatter and run away.</p>
<p>He accumulated points without much problems even without his space compression bag and battlesuit. He even caught a couple level 7-s.</p>
<p>Perhaps because he had completed his mission, a mission was renewed each time he stepped into a mission area and he was able to bring in a considerable amount of points.</p>
<p>He worked one day, rested the next.</p>
<p>He hunted every other day in order to maintain his condition. He returned after earning 50 billion points. The retention period is 2 months. He earned 50 billion points because of the battlesuit.</p>
<p>With the points he got from Odelia and Narsiel on top of that, he can repair his damaged battlesuit.</p>
<p>He can buy basic items as well. It is fortunate that only the shell was broken and a lot of the inside remained intact. The biggest worry was the battlesuit. He invested over 100 billion in creating a level S full remodeling, and it would be impossible to buy before advancing no matter how many points he had.</p>
<p>When Odin laid the judgement that regeneration is possible, he really almost cried. Whatever had happened, The Path of Blood and King’s Blood missions were completed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Odin kept his promise to Cha Jun Sung. He answered all of his questions to the best of his abilities as long as they were not regarding Life Mission’s secrets.</p>
<p>In return, Cha Jun Sung made Odin a promise as well.</p>
<p>He promised not to tell anyone what he heard.</p>
<p>Odin said that if he breaks this promise, Cha Jun Sung and those who hear the information will face unimaginable penalties.</p>
<p>He felt uncomfortable, but agreed.</p>
<p>As a result, he had two secrets he couldn’t tell. Those regarding Life Mission and the fact that he is a mutant.</p>
<p>“So you’re saying the asshole who played me is the 2nd officer, one of the three architects of Life Mission?”</p>
<p>[Yes. He is currently receiving punishment for that.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had thought that the helpers were at the very top. But he had been wrong.</p>
<p>Comparing Life Mission to a major company, they are classified by high and low positions. It is a simple and easy system.</p>
<p>The highest are the 3 officers and the investors who support Life Mission.</p>
<p>The second are the managers who participate in Life Mission’s systems or errors, and item production, and helpers like Odin. The helpers’ special right is moving dimensions. It is impossible if blocked by the powers that be, but there isn’t a limit as long as their energy allows for it.</p>
<p>The world that Life Mission was created in is Earth hundreds of years in the future, where the science is so developed even dimensional movement is possible.</p>
<p>This is something that Cha Jun Sung had assumed. It had been mentioned on Lifer World that this was the case or that it was the work of aliens.</p>
<p>Apparently, Lifer World was created by Life Mission and not in America. He said something about using it as a method to watch Lifers’ communications.</p>
<p>“Huh? Then does that mean all employees working for Life Mission are cyborgs?”</p>
<p>[In hundreds of years, the population on Earth is just 1% of what it is now. We don’t have the manpower to send humans to the past. There’s no reason to send them, either.]</p>
<p>His questions are being answered.</p>
<p>If he conducts the reality version and returns to where he came from, nothing can find him.</p>
<p>Cyborgs were a specially created camouflage team. He understands why not a single piece of information had been leaked even on the Internet.</p>
<p>“Hah! Only I can know this stuff?”</p>
<p>This information was too valuable to know alone.</p>
<p>It is so provocative that if Lifers, if the world knew, it wouldn’t just be a scandal but everything would be flipped.</p>
<p>He is itching to tell, but he has to keep it to himself. He is hearing this on that condition.</p>
<p>“Why was Life Mission – specifically Lifers and mutants – created?”</p>
<p>[Humans do not change in the present or the future. They pursue and crave something constantly. Science advances, but the nature remains the same.]</p>
<p>It’s funny.</p>
<p>Humans develop science, but humans themselves do not develop.</p>
<p>How contradictory is this?</p>
<p>[You can think of Lifers as something like the superheroes in movies, who maintain their essence while possessing the power to transcend limits.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung clenches his fists.</p>
<p>Though he has become a mutant, he still has the lingering effects of the body modifications he went through as a human. He can understand.</p>
<p>Superhero?</p>
<p>It’s possible.</p>
<p>“What about mutants?”</p>
<p>[They’re a mutation from experiments trying to transcend the limits of humans. It’s easy to taint something with pure intentions.]</p>
<p>There are things that are discovered without intention. A side product?</p>
<p>They discovered the A virus by chance while trying to create superhumans.</p>
<p>What they had wanted was a superhuman in human form, but what they had gotten was a monster. It wasn’t on the good side, but scientists had been overcome with scholarly ambition.</p>
<p>[They were experiments that couldn’t be done on cyborgs, but it was a time when there wasn’t access to enough life.]</p>
<p>So they opened two dimensional gates. Both are the same Earth. There was a slight time difference, but they were the same as though they had been copied and pasted. That’s how they spread Life Mission and the A virus in each world.</p>
<p>“The documents we found at the Institute of Biological Sciences! Right. It said ‘suddenly’.”</p>
<p>Everything is falling into place. The puzzle is coming together. Come to think of it, Black Demon had said this, but it feels different coming from Odin.</p>
<p>“What’s your ultimate goal?”</p>
<p>[We’re trying to see who can dominate between Lifers and mutants.]</p>
<p>“So what are you trying to do once you find out who the dominating species is? You said the population in that era is 1%, right? Does that mean we all become mutants?”</p>
<p>[Sorry. I did not receive permission regarding that information.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung tsked.</p>
<p>He did find out a lot, but it seems there is more that Odin is not allowed to tell him. It’s a pity, but he left it alone.</p>
<p>“Last one.”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>“What’s the exact relationship between Life Mission and Lifers?”</p>
<p>[Creator, or Creator and Creature. This is something that Borteth says often. This is cruel against you, but there’s no other way to express it.]</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Once Cha Jun Sung’s long questioning was over, it was Odin’s turn to ask. His question was something unexpected.</p>
<p>[Why did you let him live? That’s worth the death penalty according to our laws.]</p>
<p>He is referring to Hector. It may have been to save his little brother, but he lured hundreds of Lifers to Odelia. He deserves death.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung responded, ‘The world is so twisted, who gets to judge who? I would’ve just killed him if he had been a madman, but I couldn’t.’</p>
<p>That’s why he gave him Odelia’s nucleus, too. Hector tried his best in a competition of survival. His method was bad, but his intention wasn’t. Cha Jun Sung can’t say that he wouldn’t have done the same in that situation.</p>
<p>‘Odin. Sorry, but just listen to one more thing. You guys made this world.’</p>
<p>A stabbing remonstrance. Odin couldn’t refute. It’s the truth.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 215</p>
<p>“Huh? You’re saying the entire city was covered in Head Quarters?”</p>
<p>“To be precise, that’s not it. How many Head Quarters were there?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk frowns in thought and looks at Kyoko. He can’t remember how many there were.</p>
<p>She looks at him pathetically, “There was one level 7, about 30 level 6-s, and hundreds of nests and hatcheries, so we couldn’t count properly. The volume… Phew!”</p>
<p>It’s horrible to even think about, and Kyoko shakes her head.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk, Kyoko, Violet, and Basil get a cold sweat when they even think about what happened.</p>
<p>Before Cha Jun Sung entered Path of Blood, Park Jin Hyuk’s group created a raid with the World Federation and entered a level B advance mission first.</p>
<p>But they didn’t come out until about half a month after Cha Jun Sung, who had remained inside his mission for some time.</p>
<p>The mutants they met inside that mission were the Head Quarters they had encountered at the Institute of Biological Sciences before, and there had been dozens of them. A large city had been contaminated by level 7 Head Quarters, but the only person in their group who had tried catching them in the virtual version had been Nine Tail.</p>
<p>“They’re layered by sequence of evolution like a hamburger, and the outside looked like a hatchery. I’m not lying, but levels 1 and 2 created several tens of thousands within moments.”</p>
<p>Levels 1 and 2 mutants aren’t big threats to level B Lifers. They’re so weak that they can be swept away with just automatic cannons or reinforced rifles.</p>
<p>Even if there are tens of thousands of them.</p>
<p>The problem is that once this was repeated a few times, they started to use up all of the equipment they had brought. They can’t kill without laying a hand on them. After getting through the hatchery wall, it is a nest. Mutant levels went up to levels 3 and 4 as well. Those are still weak levels, but they rebel more.</p>
<p>“Head Quarters and nests are big, and they’re visible from far away, right? And wasn’t it a big city? Couldn’t you use something like a white phosphorous shell?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk shook his head.</p>
<p>There were so many hatcheries gathered together that there were a lot of different mutant types. There were all different types.</p>
<p>“Jun Sung. You know what Red Blood Worms are, right?”</p>
<p>“Ugh! Red Blood Worms? If those were there, that means they would have been everywhere.”</p>
<p>Level 4 Red Blood Worms.</p>
<p>They spit out a liquid that is as red as blood, that becomes as hard as steel. They are weak in offense, but strong on defense.</p>
<p>A massive about of Red Blood Worms completed a block in the shape of a dome over several years, with Head Quarters living inside. Only a hole for Lifers to enter had been created, and the rest of the paths in and out had been blocked. The Lifers had struggled fiercely to created a way out.</p>
<p>They found out later, but the thickness had been 4m. That means it was like a steel wall 4m thick. They tried throwing bombs at it, but it only affected the outer wall. They were only able to reach the hatcheries once they had gotten through the wall of Red Blood Worms, and they took care of those sequentially.</p>
<p>“More than 600 people died. We had to fight head on against two level 7-s and hundreds of level 6-s that the Head Quarters created.”</p>
<p>Head Quarters created a massive amount of powerful soldiers while the hatchery and nest created time.</p>
<p>And they created a total war.</p>
<p>“Ugh…! If it hadn’t been for Nine Tail, we might have been completely wiped out.”</p>
<p>Nine Tail had said that they cannot leave the Head Quarters’ main body. He said that once they’re backed into a corner, the sub-objects suck nutrients from the main body.</p>
<p>Something about how if that happens, they could pick off the level 7-s by the hour.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group works well together, so they took on the Head Quarters. The rest of the people fought the level 6 and 7-s, but a lot of them died in that battle.</p>
<p>There weren’t 30 Lifers who advanced even with that sacrifice. Fortunately, Park Jin Hyuk’s group’s contribution was high, so they all advanced along with a few Rankers.</p>
<p>“Jun Sung, tell us what happened to you too.”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>What can he tell?</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung explained his battles against Odelia, Narsiel, and Vanessa. Everyone listened with interest.</p>
<p>Rankers Koharu, Violet, and Basil in particular know that level 8-s’ offense is stronger than people think.</p>
<p>It is difficult for even a total trailblazing level A Lifer to fight one-on-one against a level 8. Even with the weakest, they need to stick with at least a party.</p>
<p>“Just because a mission level is high doesn’t always mean you need to enter with a force or raid. There are restrictions with larger numbers.”</p>
<p>The maximum entry for level A missions is a 10,000 member core or corps.</p>
<p>If they go around in hordes, it is easier for mutants to spot them.</p>
<p>This means they could end up in an unnecessary battle.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had not been bothered by other mutants in the Path of Blood while fighting against Evil Queen’s three daughters. He only fought with them.</p>
<p>If they had entered in threatening numbers from the beginning to fight the three daughters, there is a high probability that they would have had to go to war.</p>
<p>North America is Evil Queen’s region.</p>
<p>If she is the queen, her daughters are princesses. If a princess gives an order, soldiers do not have the authority to say no.</p>
<p>Sometimes, less is more. Having more people is better, but there are times when having small numbers is advantageous.</p>
<p>No matter how excellent the Lifers are, if there are too many people on a boat, the boat is bound to sink. Everyone has their own tendencies, so they are bound to make missteps. If they want to survive level S and A missions going forward, it is important that they take these kinds of matters into consideration and create maximum efficiency.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group took Cha Jun Sung’s words to heart.</p>
<p>This is advice from the experience of the only level S Lifer at this point in Life Mission.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s PDA rings.</p>
<p>He checks his phone reflexively. It isn’t a voice call, but it is a message someone left.</p>
<p>“Oh! Jun Sung?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Strategist wants to see you. Stop putting him off and pick up.”</p>
<p>Someone who doesn’t know might think that he doesn’t like Strategist. Cha Jun Sung isn’t avoiding him because he doesn’t like him. He just ignored him because he had something to do every time he called.</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“He said he’s preparing some kind of project, so it’ll probably be about that.”</p>
<p>“Project?”</p>
<p>“I don’t really know. Ask him yourself. Aha! We can go together.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk wrote a response and decided on a time to meet.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung thought about the project.</p>
<p>What could it be?</p>
<p>He’ll know once they meet, right?</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s jaw dropped when he saw the thousands of drawings laid out on the wide table.</p>
<p>He looked back and forth between the drawings and Strategist.</p>
<p>He doesn’t understand what the drawings mean. It is too complicated for him to be able to comprehend. Strategist stuck his tongue out too.</p>
<p>“So – so you’re saying you’re going to create what’s on this drawing?”</p>
<p>“I thought while completing the level B advance mission that no matter how much we raise our specifications, there are limits if we don’t have a giant weapon like Life Mission.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks down at the table again.</p>
<p>He cannot understand, but he knows what the drawings are meant to create and what it’ll be used for.</p>
<p>[Albatrus Blueprint]</p>
<p>– Albatrus: 1 billion points, 20 million achievement points</p>
<p>– 70% of Earth, it is an unknown world more than twice as large as combining all six continents. Even with scientific technology that can go beyond the sky and space, they could not take on the sea. The primary reason is that the tremendous pressure gets worse the lower they go in the deep sea! Defenseless nature has the power to crush any submarine. On top of that, ever since the A virus spread, ocean mutants increased and changed the environment for the worse. Since Life Mission was created as an all-in-one strategic weapon with all of the science they know, that is the Sub Alabatrus. If Lifers are able to make the Albatrus descend, there is the possibility that they become rulers of the sea!</p>
<p>To say it plainly, these thousands of drawings are a blueprint to create the Sub Albatrus. It even has the materials needed written down.</p>
<p>Strategist is thinking of making the Sub Albatrus.</p>
<p>“Wow. Won’t it be better to buy the finished product?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung asked thoughtlessly.</p>
<p>It is a strategic weapon beyond the battlesuit. It is hundreds of times what a single individual is capable of buying.</p>
<p>“This is a drawing of something that can’t be found in level A, but level S.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks surprised.</p>
<p>Level S store?</p>
<p>There is no way Strategist would have opened level S. Could there have been another card?</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 216</p>
<p>“I opened up the lucky boxes I had gathered the other day, and I found one.”</p>
<p>“If it’s an item from the level S store… will you be able to find all of the materials you need to make it? It’s bound to use materials from the same level.”</p>
<p>Looking at the conclusion, they can create a downgraded version if they fill in the missing parts from level A. This is what his helper had told him.</p>
<p>“He said it’s performance might be just 30% of a level S, but there shouldn’t be apparent differences. And they don’t sell the completed product anyway.”</p>
<p>That had been the decisive reason for his wanting to create it.</p>
<p>Think about it. A completed product needs to be purchased by an individual, and how many points would that call for?</p>
<p>There is no standard for them to distinguish whether the current drawings are right or wrong, but what if they really could dominate the sea?</p>
<p>This is just my personal thinking, but I have no doubt that the Sub Albatrus was created as a weapon against Sea God Levadan.”</p>
<p>The last of the six Disasters, Sea God Levadan.</p>
<p>None of the 36 Rankers saw Sea God Levadan with their own eyes. Underwater battles are trickier than those above ground.</p>
<p>The sea is more than twice as large as the six continents. The deep areas are more than 10,000m deep. Where would they even go looking for him?</p>
<p>The funny thing is that it is a problem even if they find him.</p>
<p>There is no way to catch him.</p>
<p>Just as fish cannot live on ground, humans cannot live under water.</p>
<p>This is why even in the virtual version, they were more averse to water mutants than they were to flying mutants.</p>
<p>“Levadan…”</p>
<p>“Is there an exchange if it’s a weapon that lets us take on Levadan? That’s why they don’t sell the completed product. It’s impossible to buy.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looked over the drawings of Albatrus, and stopped at the last sheet. It has all of the materials they need written on it.</p>
<p>“1000 level – level A energy cores?”</p>
<p>“At least. We don’t have level S energy cores to be at the center.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung instinctively touched his chest.</p>
<p>He has a level S energy core. The one in his fully modified battlesuit.</p>
<p>Strategist smiles. They need dozens of them. It would be nice to have them, but he can’t ask Cha Jun Sung for his.</p>
<p>Trillions of points will be used up in building this. There are 1000 in just level A. The numbers in levels B, C, and lower are enough to make his head spin.</p>
<p>“It’s a downgrade, but I’m expecting the points to come out to be in the tens of trillions.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung choked on Strategist’s words.</p>
<p>That’s more than he had been thinking. It’s a number that would be impossible even for a group.</p>
<p>This is only possible for the World Federation, which is formed by large guilds receiving aid from dozens of countries. It is too much even for hostile force, Bloody Kingdom.</p>
<p>“I’m going to get the materials from Lifers in World Federation. Those who have over billions are Rankers and masters of large guilds and cadres. We’ll get a little from those below them. Won’t it be possible out if we all work together?”</p>
<p>“How will you make it?”</p>
<p>He says that he can get the materials through tens of thousands of Lifers. But he is curious as to how they will actually create it.</p>
<p>“I’m going to leave it to the cyborgs. I showed this to famous shipyard engineers, and they said that they’d rather heal a patient with an incurable disease.”</p>
<p>They can create it if they enter the drawings into artificial intelligence.</p>
<p>Lower and mid levels lack the skill, so they need to be higher level.</p>
<p>It means that cyborgs become laborers.</p>
<p>Hundreds of points will go into just this purchase. But what can they do? Humans can’t do it.</p>
<p>It is because of the difference between the science of Life Mission and the current Earth.</p>
<p>4 and 5 year olds can learn addition and subtraction if they are taught. If they are taught even more, they can even learn multiplication and division.</p>
<p>However, they could never learn equations, calculus, functions, and sets with their ability to learn.</p>
<p>The standards of the two worlds had become the difference between the earth and the sky in the first place.</p>
<p>“How long are you expecting it to take?”</p>
<p>“It seems like 3 or 4 months will be enough since cyborgs aren’t humans.”</p>
<p>They can work 24 hours a day, 720 hours a month without rest. One advanced cyborg can work the same amount that 100 humans can.</p>
<p>What if there are over 1000 of those?</p>
<p>The production speed will be fast.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had one question. Why is Strategist trying to make the Albatrus? It costs 100 trillion.</p>
<p>“We can’t just keep depending on battlesuits. We can try various strategic tactics, but even if we’re not infantry, the end is a handful of guns.”</p>
<p>Lifers utilize items that fit each of their dispositions. They use weapons ranging from artillery, guns, to swords. The only difference is being at a distance or close range.</p>
<p>There are machines other than these weapons in Life Mission’s store that Lifers make themselves like tanks, jets, and helicopters. They perform incomparably better than those of contemporary times, but they have fatal drawbacks. They are expensive and difficult to operate.</p>
<p>Basic battlesuits are 10 million. Basic tanks and armored cars are on the fringe as well. They need to learn to drive them or make a cyborg do it for them.</p>
<p>Compared to the expensive points, there are a lot of things that they need to keep in mind like double sensitivity. They perform well because they are deadly weapons created to defeat the enemy. The problem is that rather than investing points there, they benefit more by investing in battlesuits and using the rest of their points to get auxiliary equipment.</p>
<p>The ground isn’t a suitable environment for hundreds of tanks or armored cars to move on. Efficiency decreases in places that are impossible to enter.</p>
<p>It is also hard to hide the noise, so it is easy to become targets for mutants.</p>
<p>So if they are using a battlesuit, there is no reason to add on more gear to make it more complicated. That only brings bad results.</p>
<p>“There are too many obstacles on the ground. No matter how I think about it, there isn’t anything more efficient than fighting with a battlesuit.”</p>
<p>Powerful and easy.</p>
<p>These are the battlesuit’s greatest advantages.</p>
<p>“But the Albatrus is different. This giant weapon can take on tens of thousands of Lifers at one time, and it has tremendous combat power. This makes the genocide of mutants possible.”</p>
<p>How is the power of an aircraft carrier?</p>
<p>It is impossible to compare to tanks or armored cars. If they board the Albatrus, they can reduce the Lifers sacrificed while wasting points.</p>
<p>It’s just a theory because they haven’t practiced, but Strategist stayed up all night to check the specifications and it seems there is plenty of possibility.</p>
<p>“Rather than the sea and shore, it is the difference between weapon quality and application.”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>The sea is a tricky area for Lifers to act in. There are very few missions related to the sea, and Lifers avoid even those.</p>
<p>If a means of attack forms, they don’t fall behind on the merits of above ground war. With the Albatrus, they can kill mutants without even touching them.</p>
<p>There are no boundaries in the vast ocean. They can keep going up and down.</p>
<p>They can move as they please and kill everything in sight because there are no towering mountains or cumbersome things like buildings. Moving around is easy too. They can just float around.</p>
<p>“The Albatrus is a weapon sold in the level S store. We need to use it.”</p>
<p>He wouldn’t have made work like this if it had been an ordinary marine weapon. It’s the type of thing that they can’t get now like the opening card.</p>
<p>“After hearing you out, it really doesn’t seem bad.”</p>
<p>There is a giant tank that 100 Lifers can board among above ground weapons as well.</p>
<p>It is a weapon in the level A store. They can buy this through drawings as well, and a bus would look like a toy car if placed in front of it.</p>
<p>Since they’re able to make the Albatrus, there’s no reason for them to buy it now. Strategist was actually thinking of using this kind of item too.</p>
<p>“You might have heard from Mr. Park Jin Hyuk, but more than 600 people died during the level B advance mission. It’s a terrible loss since they were a valuable power.”</p>
<p>There was a collision immediately after getting through the Red Blood Worms. They had wide range weapons but if they come in hordes, they have no choice but to engage in close range battle.</p>
<p>“I was able to get to this high position due to the sacrifice of others. I’d like to protect lives I can protect.”</p>
<p>They need a sturdy and large shield that can protect them from any attack.</p>
<p>The Albatrus would be able to play that role.</p>
<p>“And there is someone who can support my decision. Come in.”</p>
<p>Wiing!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks at the automatic doors of the office. At the moment, they are the only two people in the room.</p>
<p>Who is going to come in?</p>
<p>As the automatic doors open, a fairly old middle-aged man enters. This is someone Cha Jun Sung has never seen before.</p>
<p>“Introduce yourselves to each other.”</p>
<p>“Cha Jun Sung, I’m Overload.”</p>
<p>“We’ve met a few times in the virtual version, but it seems you don’t recognize me because I look different. I’m Yann Clark. I’m a Sea General.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Sea General.</p>
<p>He is a unique Lifer, the only one of the 36 Rankers who worked with the sea in the background. No user is better versed in Life Mission’s ocean than he is.</p>
<p>Had he been in the World Federation?</p>
<p>“Alright. Then shall we get started?”</p>
<p>He thought they were coming to an end, but they’re now just getting started?</p>
<p>It seems this will take a long time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 217</p>
<p>Most Lifers are prejudiced towards the ocean.</p>
<p>This is referring to the abnormal ocean where sea mutants live. This is the same for Cha Jun Sung. The ocean is where they can’t move properly without specialized equipment.</p>
<p>Sea General worked in the ocean for 10 years. A few users also worked in the ocean, but he is the only one who caught a level 8.</p>
<p>An underwater level 8, not a level 8 above ground. It’s incredible.</p>
<p>“There’s something that Lifers are mistaken about, but sea mutants are weaker than above ground mutants. It’s just that Lifers are handicapped because their activity is in the ocean, making people feel like these mutants are stronger.”</p>
<p>He said that he had been completing missions in the ocean since the reality version was launched.</p>
<p>“Above ground mutant are as smart as humans once they get to higher levels. Isn’t it kind of a definite since some of them are evolved from humans?”</p>
<p>Sea mutants aren’t like that. Humans can’t live in the ocean.</p>
<p>Since evolution begins from marine life, they become smart animals rather than as smart as humans.</p>
<p>Sea mutants can’t approach humans intelligence, and they can’t get close to absorbing human knowledge. The level 8 that Sea General caught was also smart and shrewd, but he had finally been able to catch it.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that the ocean would be easier if we had the proper equipment?”</p>
<p>“It’d be good to change the battlesuit to act in the ocean.”</p>
<p>This was the point. If they could just create the Albatrus, it’ll become the best weapon to attack with and hunting level 8-s could be easy. Cha Jun Sung cannot sympathize because he used all his energy in killing Odelia and Narsiel.</p>
<p>“1000 people can enter a level B mission and 10,000 people can enter level A. What do you think would happen if these kinds of numbers of Lifers roamed above ground?”</p>
<p>Since they are big even after hiding their traces with the battlesuit, they would soon be found out by mutants.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung agreed.</p>
<p>This is right.</p>
<p>“But the Albatrus could move that many people secretly.”</p>
<p>There are more docile sea mutants than there are aggressive ones. A lot of them move in hordes because they haven’t been able to evolve past their animalistic habits, but it’s game over if they just torpedo it in the middle.</p>
<p>“I bought a submarine in the level B store and have been working in the Pacific Ocean. I worked on a boat in real life, did it for 10 years in the virtual version, and lived in the ocean for over 4 years in this place too.”</p>
<p>What he heard from Strategist is that the Albatrus is the top combat weapon. People with level A specifications would be able to catch level 8 mutants.</p>
<p>This would strengthen them to level S and once completely filled with Lifers, they might even be able to catch Sea God Levadan. A man needs to have a goal. Sea General wants to catch Sea God Levadan and quell the ocean.</p>
<p>He isn’t making an appeal for the Albatrus with personal ambition.</p>
<p>There’s no reason to only go through missions on land. If they just succeed in creating it, they could move their main stage to the ocean. Simply put, they can kill with the Albatrus instead of working themselves to the bones with battlesuits.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung listened and thought that something was missing.</p>
<p>He had listened to Strategist and Sea General’s impassioned speeches and enough of the explanations, but he doesn’t know why they have called him here.</p>
<p>“But why have you called for me?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be straightforward. Have you purchased anything from the level S store that could be used for the Albatrus?”</p>
<p>He doesn’t. Of course he doesn’t.</p>
<p>He plummeted when he lost his space compression bag. He’s still going crazy when he thinks about what a loss it is.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung told them the truth. It doesn’t make sense that he lost something so important, but what could he do? It’s the truth.</p>
<p>“What a pity. Then will you be able to help us in creating this?”</p>
<p>It seems they’re asking him to become an investor. What they want from him won’t be several millions of points. It’ll be in the billions at the least.</p>
<p>‘There isn’t really any item to buy.’</p>
<p>He doesn’t have anything to buy in the level A store since he hasn’t opened level S.</p>
<p>All he has left to do is to save up points for future use. If he wants to, he could help. The key is what benefit there would be to him.</p>
<p>“How much support do you need?”</p>
<p>“It’s 1 trillion. Rankers are 50 billion, cadres 20 billion.”</p>
<p>0.1% of 100 trillion.</p>
<p>It is a small portion overall, but thinking of all of the Lifers who will invest, one person will have to take on 1/1000.</p>
<p>“If you help us, we will put you in the level A advancement.”</p>
<p>“Advancement?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s eyes grow wide. Level A advancement missions are extremely limited. There are only 50 level A missions, and there aren’t even 3 advancement missions.</p>
<p>High difficulty. Of those, there isn’t a mission related to the ocean.</p>
<p>He was going to wait until Park Jin Hyuk’s group met level A specifications, but they’ll get him in?</p>
<p>“Yes! It’s a level A advancement in the ocean.”</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>Life Mission’s satellite cannot watch the ocean’s ecosystem, so there are only a couple level B missions, much less level A.</p>
<p>“I was near the Pacific Ocean when I found Deep-Sea Teeth.”</p>
<p>Sea General speaks.</p>
<p>Deep-Sea Teeth are level 8. He had discovered them in the virtual version as well and went looking for them thinking they might live in the same place, and it had been a hit.</p>
<p>“When I found them, a level A advancement mission came up. Haha! It’s a good thing I ignored them and just went on, or else I could have died.”</p>
<p>“You say ‘them’?”</p>
<p>“There’s a male and female pair.”</p>
<p>He’s saying there are two.</p>
<p>Of course. There have to be two level 8-s to make it an advancement mission.</p>
<p>“Do they live in the Pacific Ocean?”</p>
<p>“Yes. They have a newborn baby, so they won’t move.”</p>
<p>There’s no reason for them to move. They are below Levadan, but Sea Teeth are a top predator in the ocean. They will hold that position now too.</p>
<p>“But if we kill them with the Albatrus, we won’t be able to advance because we wouldn’t get enough contribution points.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s enough to support when fighting against two of them, since what the helpers look at is whether we qualify to advance or not.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s combat power is beyond level A.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like he’ll fail even if he gets support. It would be comfortable to be backed up by a large military force.</p>
<p>It could be fine to leave it half killed and finish up. Cha Jun Sung had actually been thinking about getting help from the Federation when entering level A advancement.</p>
<p>If the Rankers go, he was confident they could complete the mission with him at the center. But from the way things are going, it looks like Strategist’s group is going to attack the ocean with the Albatrus. He needs to follow them whether he likes it or not.</p>
<p>“Can I think about it a bit before answering?”</p>
<p>“Alright. I hope we can hear good news within a month.”</p>
<p>From the perspective of Strategist’s group, they can create the Albatrus without Cha Jun Sung. They are trying to get him to join because of his combat power that goes beyond level 8.</p>
<p>Cha jun Sung held off on making a decision. He could invest in something worth 100 trillion points if he has to. He needs to weigh what is more beneficial to him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>A building that collapsed under bombing.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung and Park Jin Hyuk’s group are sitting at the top of the wreck. They are on high ground, so the panorama is in full view.</p>
<p>Corpses laid out at the foot of the wreck, near the debris.</p>
<p>They have killed nearly tens of thousands of mutants. Causes of death vary, too. They were cut up, punctured, or ripped up. And this is in progress. A lot of mutants are coming in to them. As many mutants die as well.</p>
<p>6 automatic cannons use up a mountain of bullets piled as high as they are. There are so many that the pile does not seem to get smaller.</p>
<p>There is one installed in the east and northwest directions, and 2 are supporting where they are being pushed back from the center. Cha Jun Sung’s group occasionally pulled the triggers on their reinforced rifles. Where Cha Jun Sung’s group is sitting and drawing out the scene is so disconnected from the atmosphere outside that they’re scared it might come out in their dreams.</p>
<p>Can they say it feels like the automatic cannons are a boundary?</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk yawns in boredom.</p>
<p>He occasionally throws a bomb in places where it looks like they can get through.</p>
<p>The number of corpses only increases.</p>
<p>“There are two months left, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung responds to Park Jin Hyuk. They are nearing the completion of Albatrus. They have been laboring ever since Cha Jun Sung agreed to support the project. He is actually entering a mission with his party members for the first time in a while, and they are hunting mutants in a one-sided massacre. They chose level B missions to do these in.</p>
<p>It is harrowing to think of trying to gather 100 billion points, but his party members fortunately helped take on the burden. All 5 people agreed to help him with 10 billion each for 50 billion.</p>
<p>Strategist pulled Park Jin Hyuk’s group in, too.</p>
<p>Each person promised to support with 20 billion and since they took half of Cha Jun Sung’s with 50 billion, that’s 30 billion.</p>
<p>It is hard to do alone, but it’s easy when divided up because of reward points.</p>
<p>If 6 people enter a 50 million point level B mission, there are 3 billion reward points.</p>
<p>What Lifers need to provide for the Albatrus is not points, but materials. As long as they meet the conditions, it doesn’t matter how they achieve it.</p>
<p>Party members help each other and in the case of Park Jin Hyuk’s group, they provided 70% of the materials and Cha Jun Sung hadn’t been able to match that. Even so, he is performing the role that Strategist gave him well. There are 2 months left till completion, and it seems they should more or less be able to make it.</p>
<p>“If it goes according to plan, we should be able to gather the points comfortably.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 218</p>
<p>The Albatrus’ performance is being revealed during the production process. There is a big difference between looking at it through drawings and while it is being created. The physical appearance itself is overwhelming. The boat is as large as the city seen in Dead Ark. It is smaller than a ship but top of the line in combat power.</p>
<p>There is no need for the average Lifer to kill mutants himself. As long as they board, the Albatrus brings in 1/n of mutant points. Cha Jun Sung is aiming for the advancement mission, but this is creating the optimal environment for Lifers who are completing missions with points as their target.</p>
<p>For Park Jin Hyuk’s group who has just become level A, Rankers, and below level B Lifers, matching the specifications for their respective levels was more urgent than advancement. They are doing this because they need the points, but repeatedly hunting is boring and is a source of considerable stress.</p>
<p>To think that points accumulate once they board the Albatrus even though that means that all they do is eat, sleep, and play?</p>
<p>That itself is paradise.</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter much to me since the World Federation will take care of it, but the maintenance cost must be considerable and repairs will cost a lot if it takes a big hit.”</p>
<p>Albatrus is an item similar to the Universe Eye. There is a maintenance fee in points for Lifers that board it.</p>
<p>The payment system is by paying a fee.</p>
<p>If several Lifers fill the points for Albatrus, they get used from there. If it isn’t filled, it is a definite that they can’t activate it. 1000 in just 1 second – maintaining it for one day sucks up 86.4 million points.</p>
<p>It is at a level A standard. If they upgrade to level S, they don’t know how it’ll change.</p>
<p>It is worth doing, but the numerical value is horrifying. What would happen if the supply of points is cut off in the middle of the sea? They would be buried. In the worst case scenario, they all have to squeeze out points.</p>
<p>“The sea…”</p>
<p>“I’ve wanted to go deep into the sea ever since I was very young. I’m sure everyone’s had that thought before. It’s the world of the unknown.”</p>
<p>The only body of nature that hasn’t been touched by humans. Mutants may be wild in the world of missions, but Cha Jun Sung’s world is where seeing a big whale is more fascinating than a lion or tiger.</p>
<p>There is a lot more that hasn’t been revealed compared to what’s on land.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s party alone has 4 Rankers. But they don’t know anything about sea mutants.</p>
<p>“Do you think there are 100m whales and octopus too? Or a tuna as large as a boat?”</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk has an expression full of expectation. He has a childlike innocence. He is in his early 20-s, but curiosity has no correlation with age.</p>
<p>“There are stingrays that big too.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung has never seen it either, but he has heard that there are mutants that large. There are stingrays as large as buildings.</p>
<p>“Was its name Bergon?”</p>
<p>“Bergon is right.”</p>
<p>Violet remembered the name. It is a sea mutant that is the second fastest in the ocean.</p>
<p>Aka Sleeping Scissors.</p>
<p>It is called that because it is known to be calm, but cuts everything up when it gets angry. It is also Red Eye’s pet mutant, but Cha Jun Sung has no way of knowing that.</p>
<p>“But what are Deep-Sea Teeth?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know either. I didn’t ask for details. I tried looking on Lifer World, but there’s no information. Though I wasn’t expecting to find anything since it’s a level 8 ocean mutant.”</p>
<p>“I can’t wait! A fight with a battleship and monsters! I feel like it’ll be better than a sci-fi movie!”</p>
<p>“Don’t depend on Albatrus too much. There’s going to be a lot of struggle because there are two level 8-s. We might have to battle under water.”</p>
<p>Ejection.</p>
<p>They can’t rule out the possibility of having to use a battlesuit that can be active underwater in order to fight.</p>
<p>Hundreds of small diving vessels will protect the Albatrus, but in the event of an emergency, Lifers on board will need to make up for what’s lacking.</p>
<p>It’s fine to believe in the Albatrus’ performance, but blind dependence isn’t.</p>
<p>While mutants were being massacred by the automatic cannons, two giant lizards appeared with a tremendous roar.</p>
<p>Level 7 Basilisks. Bullets bounce off of their thick skins.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stands up.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group stays seated. They are level A Lifers, but they cannot fight against level 7 mutants because they have only gone through stage 7 of body modifications.</p>
<p>Rankers didn’t get past the stage 7 wall either. There are side effects in stages 5 and 6, too. They are slowing down because they can tell what is beyond that without seeing it.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had searched for a solution to the side effects, and had found a basic answer thanks to Odin. The solution had been closer than they thought.</p>
<p>It is him.</p>
<p>“For now, it’s me.”</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>It is a bother to think of how many level 7-s he will need to kill from now on, but he’ll just do it because he already has a foot in. It’s just for two months.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>This is the production site of Albatrus.</p>
<p>Different from ordinary shipbuilding methods, building the ark is full of the unfamiliar from the foundation work to materials.</p>
<p>A buzzing scenery of workers’ chatter and the sour smell of sweat is missing.</p>
<p>Of course it is. The workers aren’t human.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Advanced cyborgs move black metals.</p>
<p>It is black iron alloy from the level B store. 200,000 points for a large stick. Most of the Albatrus’ keel and hull is made out of this. The World Federation used 8 trillion points in purchasing 40 million of these black iron alloy sticks.</p>
<p>The 10 trillion budget that they had initially estimated increased to 12 trillion, but there wasn’t that much more of a burden on Lifers. It just increased slightly. They decreased the types of items they can change as if they were batteries like energy cores and weapons, and considered what they can’t.</p>
<p>With materials from the level A store and a downgraded version, they can kill two birds with one stone. They’re on the fringe about getting even one. Strategist chose Albatrus’ durability. If it can collapse like a sand castle under the enemy’s attack, it is deadwood no matter how great the equipment is.</p>
<p>The external shape has already been completed. It has been half a month since they started production on the inside.</p>
<p>When even this is done, they have to bring in and install the thousands of energy cores to the designated locations in order to attack. For the past few months, 15000 cyborgs created the Albatrus without stopping for even a second except when they charged the energy cores.</p>
<p>The drawings themselves were input into artificial intelligence, so they were carried out without a single error. The production speed was fast.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The inside of Albatrus.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s group and Strategist’s group are gathered at the place that will become the headquarters.</p>
<p>Since nearly 20 Rankers are gathered together, it looks completely full even though that isn’t a large number.</p>
<p>There are Lifers like Nine Tail and Light Shooter who aren’t bound to groups and take on personal activities instead, but they went against their personalities and decided to work together because of the difficulty of the advancement mission.</p>
<p>If Cha Jun Sung’s combat ability hadn’t been above average, it is so difficult that they wouldn’t be able to complete it without overdoing themselves.</p>
<p>They will be massacred if they enter a level A mission without Cha Jun Sung now.</p>
<p>So they need to work together even if they don’t want to, and they can’t take on a level A mission if they don’t advance. Now, their greatest concern is body modification.</p>
<p>When they get together, they only talk about topics regarding body modifications.</p>
<p>Rankers think that Cha Jun Sung is in stage 10 of body modifications. Even if he used the card, there’s no other way to explain completing a level A mission. Cha Jun Sung talked about his body like this:</p>
<p>‘Ever since I got infected by the Oriax in Public Underground, it seems I’ve gained immunity. That’s why I’m free from the side effects of body modifications as well.’</p>
<p>He just said what came to mind because he can’t tell them that he’s become a mutant, and they bought it just as he had expected. The side effect of stages 5 and 6 is delirium.</p>
<p>They were even more envious of Cha Jun Sung because death is a possibility in stages 7 and 8.</p>
<p>Not long ago, Cha Jun Sung heard something fun and interesting from Odin.</p>
<p>[Gauging your awakened state, you’re above level 8.] [This means that there’s the possibility an immune system is in your blood. If you drink this, it could get rid of or reduce the side effects of body modification.]</p>
<p>There is no guarantee of what will happen if an ordinary Lifer drinks Cha Jun Sung’s blood, but Lifers already have a diluted strain of A virus inside them.</p>
<p>They all have some kind of immunity to the blood.</p>
<p>These are all just hypotheses. It’s just that Cha Jun Sung thinks it’s worth a try.</p>
<p>He only told Strategist about this. It would be fortunate if he didn’t take it as his being crazy, but he thought about it positively like a human.</p>
<p>“We leave two days after it’s complete. I want to test it, but the maintenance points are too much. It looks like we’ll just have to do it during the real thing.”</p>
<p>They don’t really need it.</p>
<p>The cyborgs created it without a single error.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense for level S combat weapons worth 10 trillion points to malfunction.</p>
<p>It’s the helpers’ job to move the Albatrus into their mission area.</p>
<p>The minimum number of passengers to board is 1000. They need to match that number no matter what.</p>
<p>The normal gate opens separately for each person. The helpers will combine their power to open a giant gate, to move the Albatrus whole. When that happens, the Lifers inside will be able to follow automatically. As the level goes up, a lot of strange things happen. They all learn that much more.</p>
<p>Strategist looks at Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>He knows what that means. They can’t advance if they can’t get past stages 7 and 8, regardless of survival.</p>
<p>‘I’ll set up the meeting. They’ll make their choices.’</p>
<p>He might have to give a lot of blood.</p>
<p>The Rankers might worry too, but if they could raise the possibility by even 0.1%, they won’t turn down the proposal.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks over the construction site from headquarters. They borrowed Mechanic City’s largest stadium. Nearby, thousands of World Federation Lifers are walking around standing guard.</p>
<p>It’s because Bloody Kingdom could create a ruckus.</p>
<p>But Rankers were also standing guard, so they would have to go back even if they tried to challenge them.</p>
<p>‘Getting closer.’</p>
<p>It seemed as though it was only yesterday that they were level E Lifers, and now they are suddenly level As. If they become complete level S, only one mission is the goal.</p>
<p>‘Evil Queen.’</p>
<p>It is delusional to try to try all level S missions solo.</p>
<p>What will there be past level S?</p>
<p>Will they be able to completely understand Life Mission?</p>
<p>Let’s go. All the way.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 219</p>
<p>Strategist expected the Albatrus’ completion to take 3 or 4 months. They finally saw results a few more weeks after 4 of those months.</p>
<p>1000 members going.</p>
<p>Their group is made up of Lifers who are all level B or beyond. The cyborgs behind them are also at the top.</p>
<p>They will assist with the Albatrus’ system and take care of what Lifers cannot. They can be thought of as seamen.</p>
<p>The Albatrus’ huge form shaped as bilateral streamlines is appearing on top of the support fixture entangled in a complicated manner. Because they created most of the ship’s hull out of black iron alloy, it looks black from the outside and is glossy as if coated.</p>
<p>950m in length, 250m in width, 250m in height, total weight including load 1.2 million tons.</p>
<p>The width and height are the same to create a circular hull. It’s impossible to tell where the front and back is and where the entrance is by sight. They can’t do it, but it looks like it’ll just go rolling if they push it over.</p>
<p>Its appearance, configuration, and even its weight did not make sense.</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>When Strategist sent a signal from the head, a part of the hull opened dozens of square structures 5m by 5m came out into the air and came down. The method of boarding is unusual as it is a cutting-edge level S store weapon. When they stepped onto the structures, they were automatically taken on board.</p>
<p>The Lifers went to went to their designated rooms in order to unpack their bags but after this, their roles become clearly divided by level. None of them can be looked down on because they’re all level B Lifers. However, there are clear distinctions in those higher and lower.</p>
<p>The lowest were on standby in waiting rooms placed throughout the Albatrus under their respective party leaders control so that they could go into battle at any time.</p>
<p>The main system from headquarters will be activated soon. Force leaders took their places where 8 sub-systems had been placed in order to assist.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s group and Strategist’s group go into the command room.</p>
<p>Dozens of cyborgs are sitting in front of computers under the command room. Strategist took the chip out of his PDA and stuck it in the command room’s main system.</p>
<p>Then the Albatrus, which had been running on minimal energy with a level C energy core, began to run properly.</p>
<p>[Albatrus’ main system activated. I, Uranos, Ollaborke Den’s helper, will carry out duties as the General of this ship, the Captain.]</p>
<p>It is impossible for these simple Lifers to control the Albatrus. Even the 8 sub-systems will be controlled by the force leaders’ helpers.</p>
<p>The subs are being submitted to the main temporarily. They act independently, but the main system gets the final say so that they cannot act arbitrarily. Put negatively, Uranos is basically the king while aboard Albatrus. But still, he’s just a helper assisting Lifers.</p>
<p>Albatrus’ engine grows hot due to the energy cores and there are sudden changes on board, but this did not show outside.</p>
<p>The ship is being activated, but they have not turned on the propeller that will take them forward.</p>
<p>If they turn the propeller on while on land, it will break through the stadium walls and wreak havoc in Mechanic City.</p>
<p>It might as well be a 950m missile.</p>
<p>Modern submarines gain driving force from propellers, but the Albatrus is different. Energy cores bring driving force while discharging air to the base. When it goes into the ocean, this is used as water power. That’s why they need to maintain this state until they go to the ocean.</p>
<p>[Currently boarding. Enjoy your time exploring the ocean.]</p>
<p>Strategist’s gentle voice can be heard.</p>
<p>Lifers utilize their PDAs at the same time. They’ll start their first entry with a level B mission.</p>
<p>There aren’t level A missions in the ocean. That’s why there are 1000 people as well. There’s a limit beyond that because it’s a level B.</p>
<p>Vroom!</p>
<p>The space near the Albatrus becomes completely distorted. This is what happens when the 1000 summons gates for each person becomes integrated.</p>
<p>The Lifers watching this strange scene from outside, could only blink. Someone even tried filming it.</p>
<p>Then the moment the distorted space swallowed the Albatrus, the huge ship disappeared from Mechanic City’s stadium.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>When the Lifers and Cha Jun Sung became aware that they had entered the mission, the Albatrus was already floating somewhere in the broad Pacifiic Ocean.</p>
<p>[Front mirror image change. Welcome to the underwater world.]</p>
<p>Once Uranos’ command was entered, the front became a screen.</p>
<p>Hundreds of cameras attached to the Albatrus give them the impression of looking at the ocean through a glass wall.</p>
<p>It feels like they are walking on water.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks down.</p>
<p>Rather than the hard ground, there is the deep sea that looks like it’ll swallow him up. The ocean does not fit inside a narrow screen. The entire headquarters becomes a screen so the Lifers can check the ocean with their own eyes,</p>
<p>It does not apply to the Lifers in waiting rooms, but there are similar screens in the 8 places with sub-systems.</p>
<p>‘How interesting.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks on in wonder.</p>
<p>He has been on such a huge ship very few times in the virtual version. He’s almost never been on such a ship.</p>
<p>He has been on an armored tank as large as a 4 or 5 floor building and a ship bigger than an apartment building, but this is the first time he’s been in such a large submarine. Albatrus is a submarine, but they can take the top off to make it look like a ferry.</p>
<p>It is versatile and has all the functions possible for the ocean.</p>
<p>At the bottom of the Albatrus, the propulsion engine uses the energy core’s power to go in reverse and float 1.2 million tons of weight. It is just floating, and does not advance. Everyone is awed by the mirror image of the sea. They don’t care because they have plenty of time.</p>
<p>[Water barrier deployed. Energy core output 20%, simulation result shows it can easily block the destructive power of tons.]</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Something like a transparent veil covers the Albatrus.</p>
<p>This is also technology that utilizes water power, and it is a defense against the enemy’s attack.</p>
<p>The basis of battle is hitting without getting hit, whether it is a war in the air, on the ground, or in the water. If they need to get hit, they can hit while getting hit. No matter how well Uranos controls Albatrus, it is not possible to protect this kind of large body against the enemy 100%.</p>
<p>[Sound wave, Raider confirmed. Energy core output 10%, exploring life and geographic features within a 50km radius.] [Porthole opened. The arrangement of 100 hydraulic guns, 10 water pressure guns, 3 water artilleries, and 300 combat-type small submersibles completed.]</p>
<p>Uranos got an understanding of the Albatrus step by step.</p>
<p>They tried several times before going out, but practice and combat experience are different even for artificial intelligence. Even thousands of energy cores need each system’s output to be distributed properly. It is important that it does not get concentrated in any one place.</p>
<p>If they only focus on the barrier, other things can’t help but be neglected.</p>
<p>Energy isn’t infinite.</p>
<p>They cannot forget that.</p>
<p>Ready to go. Set up a seaway to perform the mission.]</p>
<p>“Open map.”</p>
<p>Uranos reacted to Strategist’s signal.</p>
<p>On a cubic hologram, a map showing Pacific Ocean opens up and is marked with a red dot.</p>
<p>The red dot is Albatrus. They entered into the mission and they are completely done preparing to go through the mission. All that’s left is setting up the seaway.</p>
<p>“General.”</p>
<p>“203. 936. 582. 162. Those are the coordinates for where I found the Deep-Sea Teeth.”</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>Strategist enters the coordinates that Sea General tells him.</p>
<p>Then on top of the map, another red dot appears. It is where the Deep-Sea Teeth lives.</p>
<p>Right now, Cha Jun Sung’s location is towards the end of the middle where Asia and North America connect. Red dots are more than 8000km apart.</p>
<p>“Wow! It’s far. We need to hunt as we go, so it’ll take at least a couple months.”</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk looked at the number marking the street and clucked his tongue.</p>
<p>Since it is the ocean, it will not take a long time if they penetrate in a straight line.</p>
<p>However, Strategist’s goal is not limited to completing a level A mission.</p>
<p>Albatrus’ performance test – that’s the real thing.</p>
<p>[A large number of mutants emerged 3km away. Enlarging in the view.]</p>
<p>Everyone looks at the screen.</p>
<p>A group of mutants that are long water cocoons resembling cutlass fish a dozens times as large, come swarming in. They are not trying to attack because they recognize the Albatrus as the enemy. They are just extremely unlucky fish passing in front.</p>
<p>“They’re level 3 Spiky Cutlass. There are so few of them. Have they been attacked by a predator?”</p>
<p>“They look just like their name.”</p>
<p>“Hurry up and try catching it.”</p>
<p>Nuclear urges Strategist on.</p>
<p>He wanted to see Albatrus’ performance as well. Everyone else looked on in interest as well.</p>
<p>“Let’s try earning some points. Uranos.”</p>
<p>[Water pressure guns loaded. I’ll send them in one clean hit.]</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>The porthole for one of the 3 hydraulic guns on the Albatrus’ head opened and sucked in an unmeasurable amount of seawater.</p>
<p>[Launch!]</p>
<p>Ping!</p>
<p>An extremely compressed 5m diameter water lump fired from a huge porthole, and reached the center before the Spiky Cutlass scattered. Dozens of them were swept away by the water lump and are crushed under the pressure gathered inside. That is nothing more than a simple show.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A hydraulic gun fired.</p>
<p>A 50m radius area of sweater pushes out and captures the Spiky Cutlass. They have been taken care of with one hit just as Uranos said would happen.</p>
<p>“It’s no joke.”</p>
<p>“Is that the power of a giant weapon?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was just as surprised as the other Rankers.</p>
<p>It looked like there had been about 400 to 500 them, so it is impressive. It’s easy for any one of the Rankers to kill a level 3 of their own size. It’s just that the problem with killing is an efficiency problem.</p>
<p>A one hit is too much no matter what, but it takes a long time. If hit with the hydraulic gun, even a giant mutant can’t avoid being wounded.</p>
<p>“Odin. My battlesuit would be able to take it, right?”</p>
<p>[Maybe not with water artillery, but a level A battlesuit is plenty capable of handling rapid fire shot from a hydraulic gun.]</p>
<p>Odin’s simple and clear response. This means that he can withstand it.</p>
<p>“But why can’t this impressive level S battlesuit withstand the Heavy Gravity?”</p>
<p>[Heavy Gravity is Life Mission’s most powerful method of offense and defense, so it is more valuable than the Albatrus.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s battlesuit is nautical adamantium.</p>
<p>This broke into pieces like plastic. He has no doubt because he already experienced it with his own body.</p>
<p>“About 800,000 points came in, but it doesn’t feel like anything because we have to split it up between 1000 people.”</p>
<p>“I’ll say.”</p>
<p>When they caught the Spiky Cutlass, nearly 1 million points came in. It doesn’t feel like they’re getting anything because the points are getting divided between all of the Lifers.</p>
<p>‘Is it 1700 points?’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung checks the points they tracked.</p>
<p>0.2% distribution ratio.</p>
<p>Except for the few supplying Albatrus’ maintenance points, it is unrivaled.</p>
<p>Ordinary level B Lifers are 0.05%, and there are 3 party and force leaders who are 1%.</p>
<p>Some are a lot and some are a little. There can be dissatisfaction, but they just moved past it because this is just how the world works.</p>
<p>Uranos who massacred Spiky Cutlass, turns on the propeller.</p>
<p>Albatrus advances with hydraulic power. The speed wasn’t that fast.</p>
<p>All systems including weapons activate normally.</p>
<p>Since they haven’t come to look at the sea, there was no reason for them to stay in one place.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 220</p>
<p>Dozens of hydraulic guns shoot out water.</p>
<p>They can fire once every 10 seconds, so they controlled the hydraulic guns’ shooting speed with continuous fire.</p>
<p>The hydraulic gun passes through the bodies of fish that are so deformed they look burned. It isn’t an exploding method like hydraulic impact guns.</p>
<p>Since it is a penetrating weapon capable of creating a large hole like a hard rock, it is better for hunting small numbers of mutants rather than large numbers.</p>
<p>Uranos caused overall damage with the hydraulic impact gun when they discovered a school of mutants, and used the hydraulic gun to kill the rest.</p>
<p>The energy core recovers power with time no matter how slowly. They brought along the chargers they needed.</p>
<p>They cannot use the store inside a mission however, so items are finite. They cannot know what will happen in the future. They need to manage efficiently.</p>
<p>‘It varies. The whole ecosystem is different from what’s on land. It revolves completely around mutants. Is it because Lifers haven’t touched it?’</p>
<p>Even if the land is destroyed now, it is where more than 50 billion people live so there are traces leftover in whatever shape it takes.</p>
<p>Even that will gradually disappear but with the inflow of Lifers, there are traces that humans lived there.</p>
<p>But not in the sea.</p>
<p>It is not an area that they can be active in in the first place, but the ecosystem revolves around mutants and animals.</p>
<p>There is no inflow of Lifers, so it is a different world from what is on land.</p>
<p>It has been several weeks since they set out to sea.</p>
<p>Albatrus submerged as deep as it could go.</p>
<p>They are going down close to 2000m.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>They kept repeating the boring pattern of shaking up the mutants’ center with the hydraulic impact gun and then taking care of the rest with hydraulic guns.</p>
<p>Battle is always lukewarm.</p>
<p>Except when they were resting in the guest rooms, Cha Jun Sung’s group watched this kind of scene hundreds of time. They didn’t do anything, and just ate up points.</p>
<p>There are so many mutants in this vast expanse that hundreds of them appeared in blocks of just several minutes. Levels 1 and 2 were like sand on a beach. There were less of levels 3 and 4, but it is at a proportion compared to land.</p>
<p>Once they reached levels 5 and 6, they appeared less than the lower levels.</p>
<p>It’s a party when they appear.</p>
<p>They come in hordes.</p>
<p>The levels are mixed, but they come in thousands at the least and tens of thousands if there are a lot.</p>
<p>Sea General told them that solo actions decrease and they tend to act as teams because there are more predators in the sea than there are on land.</p>
<p>When they face level 5 and 6-s, they can get at least 5 to 10 million points on the spot. They divided it up, but it’s on such a large scale.</p>
<p>“Compared to the beginning, the number of people coming in periodically is less than half.”</p>
<p>Basil speaks while looking at the screen.</p>
<p>About 10 of the 20 Rankers aren’t seen.</p>
<p>One person basically disappeared every two days.</p>
<p>They have a similarity.</p>
<p>When the situation grew boring, they stopped coming to headquarters telling them to call only when they are needed.</p>
<p>None of the Lifers were happy about this.</p>
<p>All they can do is watch. It didn’t matter if all of the Lifers became lazy. The Albatrus moved by way of the 8 helpers and cyborgs.</p>
<p>“… we’re doing something in less than half too.”</p>
<p>“… I see.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s party has 6 people. But 4 of them have disappeared and only 2 are left in headquarters. Cha Jun Sung and Basil.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk and Kyoko are gone and hiding somewhere.</p>
<p>Headquarters is just one part of the Albatrus. They must be going around spending quality time together.</p>
<p>Koharu and Violet didn’t even pay attention to them, saying that they were having fun.</p>
<p>Nuclear, who has been coming in diligently, is next to a cyborg asking something. From what they can tell, he is learning to steer.</p>
<p>Other than that, they are all in cliques.</p>
<p>Strategist and Sea General are in a deep conversation. As they get deeper into the water, the mutants get stronger.</p>
<p>Uranos is Strategist’s helper.</p>
<p>He makes his own judgements on the situation, but he cannot help but rely on Strategist for the final decision. Strategist recognized this and learns about the ocean from Sea General whenever he can. He learns quickly because he is smart.</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me?”</p>
<p>“If we didn’t have the immunity, we would still be stuck in stage 6.”</p>
<p>He wasn’t sure what to make of Basil’s sudden gratitude. Cha Jun Sung was invited to a meeting that Strategist had set up 6 days before leaving.</p>
<p>It was to talk about Cha Jun Sung and his potential immunity to the A virus, and the 7th stage of body modifications that is bothering the Rankers.</p>
<p>Explaining is easy because they all saw it.</p>
<p>He ran around unconscious when he was infected by the Oriax, and had gained the physical ability of stage 10 of body modifications when he came to his senses.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung said that and then said one more thing.</p>
<p>He asked if they were going to accept his blood, that has a high possibility with immunity.</p>
<p>The people for and against became clearly divided.</p>
<p>There were the Rankers who accepted and those who declined. For those who declined, there were two reasons.</p>
<p>In Weapon Master and Chamma Sword’s case, their pride wouldn’t let them get help from others and decided to find their own way.</p>
<p>Boom Buster, Longines, and Sea General said that it felt strange and took a negative stance, considering what could go wrong.</p>
<p>The rest of the Rankers accepted.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group happily accepted the blood, whether it was because they trusted Cha Jun Sung or they didn’t have fear.</p>
<p>Odin said that just a handful is enough.</p>
<p>He suggested they wait 2 days to see how their bodies accept the blood and change, before going through body modifications.</p>
<p>The Rankers who accepted help didn’t do so because they trust Cha Jun Sung or were convinced by him, they did so because they listened to their helpers.</p>
<p>Odin took out a part of Cha Jun Sung’s information and shared it with the other helpers to show that there is validity. Those at the top know that Cha Jun Sung is a mutant, but the helpers don’t know. This is because Odin hid it and the authorities blocked it.</p>
<p>Those who drank Cha Jun Sung’s blood were able to get through the 8th stage of body modifications.</p>
<p>They were surprised.</p>
<p>Immunity – they experienced it themselves, but they cannot believe it.</p>
<p>Weapon Master, Chama Sword, and Strategist broke through. Boom Buster, Longines, and Sea General felt the burden of stage 8 and stopped at 7.</p>
<p>“It’s done. I won’t die from taking some blood out. All I have to offer is blood.”</p>
<p>“Are you going to give this opportunity to others?”</p>
<p>“It’s just this one time.”</p>
<p>Those who turned it down and stopped at stage 7 wanted to get Cha Jun Sung’s help as it had definite effects, but that bus has left.</p>
<p>“What do you think of Strategist’s proposal?”</p>
<p>“There’s no reason to even think about it. Am I some kind of livestock to keep taking blood out of?”</p>
<p>Strategist asked Cha Jun Sung to supply blood periodically.</p>
<p>It’s ridiculous, but they know why.</p>
<p>If they can have a lot of strong Lifers to push out Bloody Kingdom and rebels, they can do whatever it takes whether it is going into missions.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung agreed with this, but they handle it themselves. He could sweep up Bloody Kingdom alone if he wanted to.</p>
<p>He doesn’t want to get involved in a conflict of interest. He’s busy enough chasing his goal.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group got a lot of help from the World Federation when he went missing, so he did them a lot of favors but this is it.</p>
<p>He has done enough.</p>
<p>Lifers, with the exception of Rankers, need to take the risk like Weapon Master and Chamma Sword and go through with body modifications.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was given a 2% distribution ratio in return for giving blood.</p>
<p>He is getting a lot of points through the Albatrus while doing nothing.</p>
<p>If they keep coming in like this on their way to where the Deep-Sea Teeth live, they would be gathering several hundreds of thousands of points while doing nothing. With the additional reward points, they can recover the 10 million points they invested in Albatrus.</p>
<p>It depends on how they think about it, but it could be that he benefited from it.</p>
<p>Ring ring!</p>
<p>While the boring sight continued, Rankers listened to a clear notification sound.</p>
<p>They have been out at sea for a few weeks, but this has never happened.</p>
<p>[A giant vital reaction has been detected 20km ahead. It seems like it felt the Albatrus’ presence and is approaching fast.]</p>
<p>They have experienced this several hundred times, so it isn’t a special case that a mutant appeared.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 221</p>
<p>It is just that the part of it being giant gets to them. The range of its sense of searching is incredibly wide for it to be able to detect something 20km away.</p>
<p>“How many are there?”</p>
<p>[There’s one. It’s appearance is being drawn through sonar detection.]</p>
<p>Uranos draws out what it looks like through a 3D video.</p>
<p>It looks strange. Like a mix of an octopus and jellyfish.</p>
<p>“It’s a Penomina.”</p>
<p>“Ah! I’ve heard the name before. What is it like?”</p>
<p>Sea General saw it being drawn out and spoke for Uranos.</p>
<p>Level 7 Penomina.</p>
<p>They live in the deep sea, so finding them is like finding a pin in a haystack.</p>
<p>Penomina is like that just as underwater mutants generally are.</p>
<p>“I won’t need to explain what it looks like. Its method of attack is its hundreds of tentacles that have a powerful poison on them. And there’s something disgusting inside of those tentacles. I guess they can be called something like mouths.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung entered a level B mission.</p>
<p>It’s not a mission aimed for completion. They just picked it to have a mission in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<p>That’s why they are ignoring it and out at sea, but the Penomina had appeared.</p>
<p>“And it’s strong.”</p>
<p>[Level B special mission Sea Watchman has been applied.]</p>
<p>As soon as Sea General’s notice ended, the special mission was applied.</p>
<p>Advancement, 50 million points.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be applied as a sub-concept if the standard were lower than a level B mission, but the mission was applied because it is high.</p>
<p>The 1000 Lifers who boarded Albatrus found this out.</p>
<p>Even the Rankers who had been yawning, opened their eyes with the appearance of powerful mutants. They have become level A Lifers, but it is an opponent that they could or could not take on while on land. That means there’s a higher chance that they will lose while fighting in water.</p>
<p>It had been boring for the past few weeks because there had only been trivial ones, but wouldn’t something like that be able to show them what Albatrus can do?</p>
<p>“Let’s try using the spiral swill artillery.”</p>
<p>“We can’t.”</p>
<p>Nuclear wants to use the spiral swill.</p>
<p>Strategist turned him down right away. It is Albatrus’ top weapon, eating up an incredible amount of energy. It takes a long time and is complicated. They can’t use it on a mere level 7.</p>
<p>[I see it. Should we attack?]</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Watch it so we can record it.”</p>
<p>Not much is known about high level underwater mutants. It’s good to get an idea of them while they have a chance. It’ll make attacking easier if they encounter them again.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>The Penomina’s dull figure appeared in the front screen mirror image and suddenly went near Albatrus.</p>
<p>Penomina watched the enemy that invaded its area rather than attacking.</p>
<p>Its tentacles wave gently and allow it to move here and there.</p>
<p>It easily moved 100m every time it waved them.</p>
<p>“It’s huge.”</p>
<p>“It looks like it’s twice the size of Metal Giant.”</p>
<p>It looks meager because of its long tentacles.</p>
<p>Its real body is a fourth of that?</p>
<p>About 70m is the tentacles.</p>
<p>But it’s still a level 7 and the intimidation it gives off from pure size is at the top of the underwater mutants they have seen until now.</p>
<p>Penomina watches the Albatrus and creates distance.</p>
<p>950m.</p>
<p>There is a 10 times difference from what can be seen by the naked eye through just comparison.</p>
<p>It isn’t strong just because it’s big, but mutants are sensitive with sight.</p>
<p>It is the fear of an intruder.</p>
<p>“Uranos, try challenging it a little.”</p>
<p>[Hydraulic gun loaded. Launch.]</p>
<p>Boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Dozens of hydraulic guns that are always opened, attack Penomina.</p>
<p>It is 30% power.</p>
<p>They adjusted it weakly in order to watch its behavior.</p>
<p>The Penomina avoids all of the hydraulic guns. Then it created more distance.</p>
<p>It sees it as a danger.</p>
<p>“What if it runs away?”</p>
<p>“It might.”</p>
<p>[The distance has now reached 800m. If you want to fire the hydraulic guns, we have to raise the output to 70%. I recommend killing it with the maximum output.]</p>
<p>Hydraulic guns have short range.</p>
<p>Even when output is up to 100%, it can only reach a couple kilometers. Hydraulic impact guns go farther, and spiral swills even farther.</p>
<p>“It won’t come near.”</p>
<p>“From his perspective, the Albatrus will probably look like a higher predator. It just has no life.”</p>
<p>It’s similar.</p>
<p>Albatrus is a machine. It doesn’t have the energy of a living being.</p>
<p>It is moving however, so the Penomina slowed down its approach.</p>
<p>“It’s just right.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung didn’t make sense, Basil looked at him in puzzlement.</p>
<p>“I’ll be right back.”</p>
<p>“What? You’ll be right back?”</p>
<p>“I thought about it but if the Albatrus is dangerous, don’t we need to go out and fight in the water whether we like it or not? I think it’s better if we fight in this relaxed state rather than being forced out.”</p>
<p>“I see!”</p>
<p>Basil immediately understood what Cha Jun Sung was saying.</p>
<p>He intends on experiencing the underwater world in advance just in case. It’s a fitting thought for him.</p>
<p>“What about support?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine.”</p>
<p>Strategist brought up support in worry after listening to Cha Jun Sung and Strategist talk.</p>
<p>Support?</p>
<p>They don’t need it.</p>
<p>They don’t need support for a mere level 7.</p>
<p>They already made their battlesuits specialized for underwater activity. There was no need to change the configuration method. They just adjusted it to withstand water pressure and to allow Lifers to breathe underwater.</p>
<p>“We’ll be able to see the difference between our battlesuits during battle in water and on land.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung, who can freely adjust his Overbooster, has the confidence to fight better than any other Lifer.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The Albatrus’ hatch opened, and Cha Jun Sung ran out.</p>
<p>The Lifers who had been spending their days bored with nothing to do, heard of Cha Jun Sung suddenly jumping out of the ship, stopped whatever they were doing, and focused on the screens.</p>
<p>Guest rooms, waiting rooms, headquarters, support headquarters.</p>
<p>They were all in different locations.</p>
<p>“It’ll be a good spectacle… The chance to see what a level S Lifer can do.”</p>
<p>Weapon Master spoke in a low voice while leaning against a wall with his arms crossed.</p>
<p>He had been resting in a guest room when he had gotten a radio from Strategist and made his way back to headquarters.</p>
<p>If he wants to examine Cha Jun Sung’s movement in detail, he needs to watch on a mirror image and not a normal screen.</p>
<p>Other Rankers had the same thought.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk and Kyoko also appeared from their hiding place.</p>
<p>‘Ollaborke, you were smart.’</p>
<p>The Rankers know better than anyone why Strategist included Cha Jun Sung in the World Federation’s creation of the Albatrus.</p>
<p>To get 10 billion points in support?</p>
<p>That’s too much for a single Ranker to take on, but that wasn’t the reason. If they can’t do it alone, they need to do it in numbers.</p>
<p>It means that they can’t include him by force.</p>
<p>Strategist wasn’t looking for points. He wanted Cha Jun Sung’s situation and power.</p>
<p>Lifers who had advanced to level A were thirsty for level A missions.</p>
<p>If they hadn’t gotten the Albatrus drawings, they would have made their target level 8-s living on the six continents with the Rankers’ experience.</p>
<p>They had put their lives on the line for level B advancement, too.</p>
<p>Making an attempt at level A in that state is a suicide mission.</p>
<p>This is where Cha Jun Sung comes in.</p>
<p>He’s the only lifer who has gotten through a level A mission alone.</p>
<p>But they hadn’t been able to get in contact with him.</p>
<p>If Rankers assist him with him at the center, they could get through a level A easily.</p>
<p>While discussing matters related to level A, Strategist got the drawings for Albatrus. Their path had been cleared.</p>
<p>The Rankers thought that it wouldn’t be possible with their own abilities, so they would get the help of machines.</p>
<p>They can take on a level 8 with the Albatrus’ abilities.</p>
<p>That’s when they had been able to reach Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Strategist thought that they would be able to complete a level A advancement if they had the strength of Albatrus and Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>A picture of everyone being satisfied was drawn out in Strategist’s mind.</p>
<p>Then they got in contact with Cha Jun Sung, baited him with advancement, and succeeded.</p>
<p>‘It probably means that level A advancement is hard even for Overload with his abilities.’</p>
<p>Though they are the same level, an ordinary mission and advancement mission are completely different.</p>
<p>If he could do it with his own party, there would have been no reason for him to accept this.</p>
<p>The fact that he accepted Deep-Sea Teeth is proof that Cha Jun Sung wants the World Federation’s help as well.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s party and the World Federation work well together like gears, so they are doing what they can do now.</p>
<p>‘Blood is… It was unexpected…’</p>
<p>When they heard that Cha Jun Sung’s blood was the key to immunity for body modification, they thought that he was crazy.</p>
<p>Except for a few, they completed stage 8 of body modifications and became total level A Lifers.</p>
<p>Even they however, could not work up the courage to fight one-on-one against high level mutants.</p>
<p>They aren’t as well practiced in using the booster as Cha Jun Sung is, but there are a lot of other things that hold them back as well. But one of the two hidden cards in this level A mission, Cha Jun Sung, scrambled to face the level 7 Penomina himself.</p>
<p>Though they tried not to show interest, it couldn’t be helped.</p>
<p>‘Show us what you can do.’</p>
<p>Weapon Master’s eyes take in Cha Jun Sung’s form, who is showing in the mirror image.</p>
<p>He won’t miss the movement of even a single finger.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 222</p>
<p>[Energy barrier 100% deployed. The battlesuit’s functions have been brought down 20.8% because of water pressure. Movement will feel a little unnatural.]</p>
<p>Level S battlesuit.</p>
<p>Even though it has been configured according to the environment, he is 2000m into the water. Cha Jun Sung isn’t a fish. Of course there are restrictions.</p>
<p>The only proper thing Cha Jun Sung purchased in the level S store is his battlesuit. He only looked at the level S support gear in awe because he didn’t have enough points.</p>
<p>He lost what he had, so the only difference from other Rankers is his battlesuit.</p>
<p>‘Heavy.’</p>
<p>That was the first feeling Cha Jun Sung had when he left Albatrus.</p>
<p>His energy was consumed faster than normal as well.</p>
<p>It’s because he’s maintaining the energy barrier at 100%.</p>
<p>This is the only way to resolve the issue of water pressure. 20% was taken off, so he can only show 80% of his true abilities.</p>
<p>[You can last 1 hour with the air from your oxygen tank.]</p>
<p>[It is a compressed oxygen tank, but it was measured on the standard of normal breathing volume. So as an aftermath of battle, he will run out of breath more quickly.]</p>
<p>“1 hour? It won’t take even 30 minutes. Don’t worry and just watch.”</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>Penomina detected Cha Jun Sung’s presence.</p>
<p>However, it did not approach him.</p>
<p>Rather, it kept watching the Albatrus behind him and kept getting further away.</p>
<p>[View radius! Sound wave mode!]</p>
<p>Because it is inside the ocean, his heat detection and infrared ray detection don’t pick up Penomina’s movement easily.</p>
<p>[Overload, are you okay?]</p>
<p>[Other than my body feeling a little heavy, it’s generally pretty okay.]</p>
<p>Penomina is swimming 2km outside.</p>
<p>That is definitely an invitation.</p>
<p>It is an invitation to come and try catching it.</p>
<p>[I’ll follow it.]</p>
<p>[It’s too dangerous. It could be a trap. If we focus an attack of hydraulic guns and hydraulic impact guns, even the Penomina wouldn’t be able to withstand it.]</p>
<p>He collected basic information about Penomina.</p>
<p>He can kill it now.</p>
<p>[It’s okay. Even if it’s a trap, it won’t be like I can’t get out of it. An opponent like that is perfect to start my exploration of the underwater world in.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had underwater battle in mind when he first boarded the Albatrus. He hadn’t interfered until now because the opponent had been too weak.</p>
<p>Underwater battle is only doable if it is up to standard. He can’t open the hatch and go out for lower level mutants.</p>
<p>[The Penomina will completely run away if the Albatrus moves, so we will leave the hydraulic guns loaded.]</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung turned the Overbooster on.</p>
<p>His body shoots through the ocean.</p>
<p>The Penomina must have thought it succeeded in luring him because it stopped once the Albatrus was only slightly visible.</p>
<p>It thought that this was a distance it could run away in.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung threw his body into the mouth. He jabbed Hades forward and adjusted the Overbooster to speed ahead.</p>
<p>It was so intense seawater around him whirled and became a tornado.</p>
<p>The stupid Penomina swallowed the tornado.</p>
<p>Penomina’s flesh ripped up and Cha Jun Sung got out.</p>
<p>He went in through the mouth, but he’s not sure whether he came out through its neck or the back of its head. The configuration of its body is very different from not just humans but ordinary mutants as well.</p>
<p>But there must be damage when seeing the blood come out.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>A scream.</p>
<p>It is a scream full of pain.</p>
<p>Attacking first is important in a battle.</p>
<p>The win could be determined with that first hit if the enemy is caught off guard.</p>
<p>The Penomina struggles and dozens of thin and thick tentacles wave around. He can’t tell whether they’re trying to wrap around him, hit him, or go through him.</p>
<p>He brought Hades up.</p>
<p>Is it because they are underwater?</p>
<p>A clear vacuum with a blue light cuts the tentacle coming at him from the front in half.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung used the time while the tentacle was being cut to try and attack, but the Penomina isn’t just watching.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A pillar thicker than the battlesuit hit Cha Jun Sung’s back.</p>
<p>It collided with a repulsive force everywhere because of the water.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung fell onto a rock with bizarre coral reef and clams stuck everywhere. As soon as he fell, he moved his body to the side.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know when it followed him, but the Penomina threw its tentacles down on him. The hard rock was destroyed with one hit, and momentarily made the water white.</p>
<p>Stealthy Cha Jun Sung shoots his reinforced rifle from amongst the debris.</p>
<p>He can’t see, but he’s using the sonic mode to see the Penomina. It is the same for the Penomina as well.</p>
<p>Marine life have different senses from land creatures.</p>
<p>The two of them went back and forth with attacks from inside the white debris.</p>
<p>‘Other than the water pressure, it’s similar to fighting in the air. It’s important to get tips.’</p>
<p>He could even feel a single finger moving.</p>
<p>There isn’t anywhere to put his feet down, so he needs to depend on the booster for balance.</p>
<p>‘It’s slow and frustrating.’</p>
<p>He needs to get used to this environment quickly.</p>
<p>The restriction on his battlesuit is 20%, but it isn’t the kind of thing that can be decided with a simple figure.</p>
<p>This is a level 7.</p>
<p>It seems that he will have to use all his power when fighting a level 8.</p>
<p>It is an environment in which he gets weaker and his opponent gets stronger.</p>
<p>‘It looks like I won’t get to even lay a hand on Levadan even after killing all the Disasters on land. It’d be a problem even finding it without the Albatrus or some other level S weapon.’</p>
<p>He saw Black Demon, White Empress, and Cruel King in person.</p>
<p>Black Demon in particular showed power that really made him feel that he is a level 9.</p>
<p>He should be given an advantage while fighting a monster like that, but to have a handicap?</p>
<p>He could see his death just thinking about it.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stepped on the ground and soared up.</p>
<p>A tentacle follows behind him. As he progresses, he grows more accustomed to the environment.</p>
<p>The Penomina’s pattern is extremely simple.</p>
<p>It uses its tentacles or occasionally sprays a strange liquid.</p>
<p>It seems like the poison that Sea General was talking about. The Penomina does what it wants, wiping it and spraying it.</p>
<p>[I was just watching without saying anything, but he hasn’t been able to kill it even after 30 minutes.]</p>
<p>“I was playing.”</p>
<p>He is going to end it. About half of it really was play.</p>
<p>Killing it is one thing, but this kind of opponent will help him for the real fight.</p>
<p>‘Level B advancement… 50 million.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung goes toward the Penomina’s face.</p>
<p>Jellyfish and octopus have vitality. They live for some amount of time even after they have been cut up into pieces.</p>
<p>If the Penomina is in that category, it is better for him to be careful to the end.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung was ripping up the Penomina’s face, he could hear a sound similar to something dying from his side.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung turned his head.</p>
<p>A tentacle filled his view.</p>
<p>“Of course. It didn’t make sense that one of these was worth 50 million.”</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>An attack of something like a spear goes at Cha Jun Sung’s body.</p>
<p>He used the Overbooster and avoided it with minimal movement.</p>
<p>2 Penominas.</p>
<p>He had been expecting that this might happen.</p>
<p>[You have 25 minutes left.]</p>
<p>Oxygen for him to breathe.</p>
<p>He hasn’t used the oxygen at a faster rate because the opponent isn’t too difficult and his breath didn’t get shorter.</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll eat it gratefully.”</p>
<p>The points would have been divided up 1/n if he had been on the Albatrus, but he had come out.</p>
<p>If he kills them, he can take all the points for a level 7 for himself.</p>
<p>And that’s two of them.</p>
<p>He won’t be able to do this too often because it would be a disservice to the others.</p>
<p>He’ll do it whenever he can. Including this time.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 223</p>
<p>A 3m diameter transparent bead is wrapped in armor like a tank. So from the sides and the top, it looked like a half sphere. It looks heavy to the naked eye, but it was a machine created with an incredible metal that is light, hard, and strong.</p>
<p>It isn’t small – about half the size of a bus – but it weighs less than 1 ton.</p>
<p>The 300 small combat submersibles on the Albatrus.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>These 300 small submersibles have all been ejected and are fighting with tens of thousands of mutants. The Albatrus is doing its part from the rear as well. 100 hydraulic guns and 10 hydraulic impact guns are launching water cannons and water bombs without stopping. This is war.</p>
<p>High level cyborgs are inside the small submersibles. They work together and keep attacking the outside wall of mutants.</p>
<p>The middle is left to the Albatrus.</p>
<p>They are less in number, but allies can be hit by allies because the battle is chaotic.</p>
<p>Each of the small submersibles have abilities that match level 6 underwater mutants. To be more precise, they are low level 6.</p>
<p>They don’t amount to even 1/1000 of the enemy’s numbers, but they hit and retreated with group strategies and individual roles.</p>
<p>“Please, please go away.”</p>
<p>“Why are there so many of them? They’re like roaches!”</p>
<p>“Don’t make such a fuss. There’s a lot of them, but they’re just levels 3 and 4.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. The combination of the Albatrus and submersibles is doing well and if we get pushed back, we’ll win if we get involved. If you make a big deal out of something like this, how are you going to take on level 8?”</p>
<p>The Lifer listened to his colleague and wanted to say, ‘We’ll probably win, but someone will die and that could be you and me!’ but didn’t.</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t say anything if there were only lower levels! Look at them! Do you want to get into an underwater battle with those guys? The moment we get involved, so will they.”</p>
<p>Behind the tens of thousands of level 3 and 4 mutants, two large creatures are standing as the final defense line to the Turtle Babies. They watch the Albatrus.</p>
<p>Turtle Captains.</p>
<p>They are evolved from turtles, hence the name.</p>
<p>Turtles do not normally live in groups unless they are in mating season, but Turtle Babies move together in hordes. Turtle Babies have hard shells so the bullets bounce off of them and they use their heavy bodies to keep hitting in a simple attack.</p>
<p>The problem is that there are so many of them.</p>
<p>They have been at sea for 4 months.</p>
<p>As they got closer to where the Deep-Sea Teeth live, they had come face-to-face with a swarm of Turtle Babies.</p>
<p>This is the largest number of mutants they have come across with until now, so the battle is that much more fierce.</p>
<p>It is a situation that is enough to worry the Lifers.</p>
<p>The Turtle Captains guarding the final defense line have been receiving the protection of the Turtle Babies, and their 60m diameter sturdy bodies wriggle.</p>
<p>They have horrible scars all over their bodies and give off the air of veterans who have experienced all sorts of hardships. If these strong guys even have experience, they will really be tricky.</p>
<p>The Turtle Captains sent their underlings out and felt that the unnecessary consumption would last. They were thinking of getting directly involved and ending it themselves.</p>
<p>“They’re acting so arrogant. So much bravado.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk so much.”</p>
<p>“Ok.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stopped Park Jin Hyuk from joking around.</p>
<p>Kyoko put her head down and sighed as though she were the one embarrassed.</p>
<p>“There are too many of them. The Turtle Babies are more of a problem than the Turtle Captains are.”</p>
<p>The Turtle Captains can act so arrogant because of the Turtle Babies.</p>
<p>To get caught up here.</p>
<p>[All Lifers, please prepare to eject. I will send the signal.]</p>
<p>They can hear Strategist’s radio come in.</p>
<p>At the end, they have been put in a situation where the Lifers need to get involved in the battle. Not one of the 1000 people stayed back.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s group naturally needs to go out as well.</p>
<p>After Cha Jun Sung took down two Penominas, the Lifers learned about fighting underwater whenever they could.</p>
<p>As he said, it is better for them to learn while they can. Over the past few months, they all got better at using their boosters. The environment itself is one in which they can’t help but get better in. They lived with water pressure on top of that, so the limits of their mental ability and withstanding physical pressure were all raised.</p>
<p>[Overload, we will create a path for you. We’ll leave the Turtle Captains to you.]</p>
<p>[Yes!]</p>
<p>The Rankers provide support. Hitting the head, the arms and legs will die on their own.</p>
<p>Albatrus and the small submersibles tried to kill the Turtle Captains, but they lack the ability. The Turtle Babies protected them even if they had to throw their bodies to do so. With the flow quickly changing every hour, it is something only Lifers like Cha Jun Sung’s group who can make fluid decisions, can do.</p>
<p>[Everyone eject!]</p>
<p>The bottom of Albatrus opens and 1000 Lifers pour out.</p>
<p>They all have compressed oxygen tanks on their backs. Without these, their battlesuits cannot even last 5 minutes. That means these tanks are a necessity.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Lifers turn on their boosters and fly away.</p>
<p>A waiting stream forms in their advance. They refrain from solitary action and act as a force.</p>
<p>Turtle Captains watch the Lifers approaching them and open their mouths wide. Then they take as large a breath as they can.</p>
<p>[Turtle Babies! We don’t know where they’ll go, so you have to stay alert!]</p>
<p>Sea General moves his body in a zig zag.</p>
<p>Lifers follow his body movement. Turtle Babies are water cannons comparable to hydraulic guns.</p>
<p>A level A Lifer’s battlesuit could withstand it, but it is too much with level B.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Two big water cannons large enough to cover two or three Lifers go out in a straight line.</p>
<p>Lifers scatter everywhere.</p>
<p>There are those who are not going in the direction they are coming in, so there is no need for them to avoid it. There are those who avoid it because they are coming in the direction they are going in. And of course there are those who weren’t able to avoid it.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung blocks the front of one of the two water cannons. Hades is pulled out of the scabbard, it leaves a sharp trace, and splits the water cannon in two.</p>
<p>He can’t block the other side, so 4 or 5 Lifers get swept away.</p>
<p>Battlesuits of Lifers who get hit full on by the water cannon, get crushed.</p>
<p>They didn’t making lasting damage on the outside, but it is different for the inside.</p>
<p>Blood keeps coming out because of the heightened water pressure.</p>
<p>[10 force, take the injured and get on half-wave submersibles and return to the ship!]</p>
<p>The last of the 10 forces, 10 force has a supporting role.</p>
<p>They have split up their roles.</p>
<p>They need to recover not just the dead and injured, but also the submersibles stuck to the bottom of the sea. Those are all points too. Each submersible is over 1 million points. And that’s not even mentioning the cyborgs.</p>
<p>The advanced rank has lower performance than the top and special ranks.</p>
<p>They cannot be militant thousands of meters deep into the sea in their bare bodies without the submersibles.</p>
<p>There’s still use for it. They can steer the submersibles.</p>
<p>A limited store.</p>
<p>Currently, they cannot replenish even useless 1 point items. They need to scrape together even a single piece of iron.</p>
<p>[Snipers, distance support! Opening up a path to the target in the shortest time!]</p>
<p>Snipers including Park Jin Hyuk get on their stomachs on top of Albatrus. It is a sphere, but it is so wide that they do not slip.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Sniper rifle bullets penetrate the Turtle Babies coming at Cha Jun Sung and the Rankers. The sniper rifle is like a cannon so its range is over 10km, but because they are in the ocean, the range and power is reduced to less than half.</p>
<p>However, it is nothing to kill a couple slow turtles.</p>
<p>[Cover Overload!]</p>
<p>Rankers create a wall near Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Level B Lifers have already joined the submersibles and are battling with the Turtle Babies.</p>
<p>It is a strenuous effort, but according to a simple calculation, he needs to handle hundreds of them alone.</p>
<p>Even if they don’t get pushed easily, the number of dead and injured will increase if they get hit by volume. The key is to catch the four Turtle Captains in a timely manner.</p>
<p>“It’s a blitz!”</p>
<p>He digs in among the Turtle Captains with Ranker support as a background. He needs to settle it before mutants smell blood.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 224</p>
<p>A smooth and slick outstretched caudal fin lightly strikes the walls of the underwater cave. The entire cave shakes.</p>
<p>Clear, bumpy muscles wave and follow movement.</p>
<p>A huge form glares and focuses on smell of the sensory organs. A vague and subtle smell bothers him.</p>
<p>It is the smell of blood.</p>
<p>It was pretty familiar, too.</p>
<p>It seems like it is coming from far away, but a lot of blood must have been lost if it flowed all the way down to here.</p>
<p>Smelling it over and over again, it can guess what kind of creature it is.</p>
<p>It is similar to the turtles acting as the king in its corner of the sea. They are lower subjects, but they swarm together annoyingly!</p>
<p>It lets them live however, because they provide ample nutrients.</p>
<p>Are they fighting over territory or something?</p>
<p>It looked to the side.</p>
<p>A female similar to itself in size and her baby, a fourth of her size, are looking at each other.</p>
<p>The female smelled it. It is a being on the same level in the first place.</p>
<p>‘Will you go?’</p>
<p>‘No.’</p>
<p>The female wants to know what is going on out of curiosity, but she cannot leave the baby and go. Taking the baby is even worse.</p>
<p>Before, she would have gone alone but she does not want to now. They were born recently, so she felt what death is for the first time.</p>
<p>If they are the ones ruling this area, those animals are the ones that rule the entire ocean. They might still be wandering this area. What that one said is still in his mind.</p>
<p>‘I’ll let you live because of the baby.’</p>
<p>It had been sincere.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for the baby, it would have killed her. She won’t go outside if she doesn’t need to because they could run into each other again.</p>
<p>The male must have recalled the memory of that time, because it left the smell and just decided to keep sleeping. Thinking of the one that is more than twice as large as they are combined, it is easy to stop being curious.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“The damage?”</p>
<p>[A submersible and 95 advanced have been destroyed, but they can be recovered.]</p>
<p>Strategist made a sound of pain when Uranos told him about the damages.</p>
<p>⅓ have been destroyed.</p>
<p>Almost 100 Lifers have been killed or injured as well. It would have been worse if Cha Jun Sung hadn’t been able to kill the Turtle Captains on time.</p>
<p>“So these are the kinds of issues we get from choosing the default Albatrus.”</p>
<p>The lowest armed status.</p>
<p>If they had followed the level S drawings, they could have armed it more heavily by 5 times. There is a lot of other technology too.</p>
<p>The armor is close to level S, but other functions – offensive power in particular – are level A. That is why the balance is tilting to one side.</p>
<p>If the Albatrus had been a complete level S battle weapon, it would have been able to kill the Turtle Babies without the help of Lifers and submersibles.</p>
<p>‘We need to advance Overload no matter what. For him and for us.’</p>
<p>If that happens, they can purchase more of the materials they need for Albatrus.</p>
<p>The level S energy core is priority.</p>
<p>With items like hydraulic guns and hydraulic impact guns, they need to increase the fire power and destructive power in the Albatrus’ energy. All circumstances are in Strategist’s mind.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>There is still a battle going on outside.</p>
<p>The smell of blood is that of more than what would be in hundreds of trucks. Albatrus’ porthole didn’t close. The submersibles didn’t go back either.</p>
<p>A majority of low level guys are like this, so it is fortunate that Lifers are going back and forth and fighting.</p>
<p>“We’re getting out.”</p>
<p>Strategist gives Uranos an order.</p>
<p>Mutants swarm in with no end. It seems it would be better for them to get out than to keep staying here.</p>
<p>Lifers and submersibles retreat to the Albatrus.</p>
<p>The mutants manically ripped up the Turtle Captains and Babies’ corpses amongst themselves. It is hundreds and thousands of tons of flesh. Different kinds of mutants are having a party. It is an amount that allows them to feast even without fighting.</p>
<p>“Uranos, search for a place where we can anchor nearby. We need to rest.”</p>
<p>[Wide scan activated.]</p>
<p>It is a large battle, so the Albatrus’ energy has been reduced to less than half.</p>
<p>They need to fix the submersibles and cyborgs, and they need to take care of the injured.</p>
<p>For the dead, they took care of the corpses, spraying antiseptic and freezing them&gt;</p>
<p>“Is it 150km…”</p>
<p>There are still 150km left until the location where Sea General said he found Deep-Sea Teeth. From now on, they need to place more importance in their radar than other functions.</p>
<p>They search a radius of 50km with 10% energy.</p>
<p>They can’t do 500km just because they use 100% energy. A maximum of 200km is the limit.</p>
<p>It is certain as they get closer, and uncertain as they get farther away.</p>
<p>If they check 200km outside with maximum output radar, they can know ‘there’s something there.’</p>
<p>They can only determine what something is if it is within 100km. They can’t just look out like it is their palm because it is such a wide range.</p>
<p>“It’s making me nervous.”</p>
<p>Two level 8-s.</p>
<p>They cannot even imagine how many underlings there are. It is uncertain whether they can take one on even if Cha Jun Sung gets involved.</p>
<p>Discovering first and delivering the first blow is the shortcut to lessening the damage and increasing the odds. They need to stay alert.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>They are 2500m deep in the ocean. The Albatrus is seated on an adjacent coral reef bigger than a person with some of the features turned on, reorganizing.</p>
<p>Reorganizing doesn’t mean anything tremendous. They are just on board, repairing broken or damaged submersibles and advanced cyborgs. A majority of high level or special cyborgs are put into repair work. Unless the Albatrus doesn’t operate, they are basically unemployed.</p>
<p>Even if the material items are finite, they packed enough so they wouldn’t run out before going out.</p>
<p>If the water barrier is broken through and the Albatrus itself was hit, it would hurt but there is no issue with the parts.</p>
<p>They can take this kind of damage even if they do it a few more times. Their battle against the Turtle Captains and Turtle Babies consumed almost 65% of the Albatrus’ energy. It is the result of fighting for nearly half a day.</p>
<p>Energy being consumed at a high speed. Strategist left level A energy cores gathered during battle, a general charging device plugged in the energy room. The speed of charging is several hundred times slower compared to a rapid charging device, but they cannot use rapid charging devices in fighting mere turtles.</p>
<p>They need to save it until the end and use while fighting level 8-s. Albatrus needs to be holding more than 30% energy no matter what. 10% radar, 10% water barrier, 10% engine.</p>
<p>Uranos managed the rest of the hydraulic guns efficiently with the leftover 70% of the remaining energy. Since he is artificial intelligence, he is meticulous and computational.</p>
<p>The Albatrus currently consumes at least 40% of the energy. The figure went up a little because the water barrier used 20%.</p>
<p>If the water barrier is taken away, the enemy’s attack will hit the main body. If the radar goes off, there’s no way to know where anything is. If the engine is turned off, they will plummet to the ocean floor. This is how they get to 30%.</p>
<p>If the energy goes down below this, they need to give up on functions in order. Of the three, plummeting seems to be the most dangerous. If they hadn’t plugged in the general charging device, they would have gone down below that. That’s how fierce the battle against tens of thousands of Turtle Babies is.</p>
<p>“How long will it take?”</p>
<p>[10 to 12 days with natural charging, 2 days with the general charging device. We have 900 to 950 general charging devices.]</p>
<p>General charging devices are different in quality and quantity according to store level. The average of what they prepared for this mission is level B. With this much energy, they could fill up the energy of level B battlesuits all the way seven times and have some left.</p>
<p>“It takes too long… But let’s try it since we have some time.”</p>
<p>If they add a few more days, natural charging takes about 2 weeks. They brought 5000 general charging devices with them. They’ve used about 400, so they have 4600 left. They also have 500 rapid charging devices, so there’s no need to worry about energy. They will use what the Lifers possess when the Albatrus is in danger.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Special cyborgs take out general charging devices and plug them into the level A energy room. This energy flows into level B and C energy rooms as well.</p>
<p>“We’ll finish up our search as soon as it’s completely charged.”</p>
<p>[Roger that.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 225</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Uranos used more than 50% of the energy on the radar. The extensively broadened sonar searches over a 100km radius.</p>
<p>The picture on a 3D hologram video changes every hour. It checks the shape of mutants captured on radar in real time. The terrain was examined in another place. They moved at the lowest altitude they could, close to the sea floor. They went deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was curious about the imposing water pressure at 4500m into the sea, so he went outside even though there was no battle.</p>
<p>“My joints hurt. It’d be better for level B Lifers to stay on board.”</p>
<p>It’s water pressure that level B battlesuits can’t withstand. They need to be level A at the least. The 30% restriction that gets them as soon as they go out. It’ll be 50% for level A.</p>
<p>If they had been on land, they would be able to take on level 8-s – even mutants on the level of Red Eye – but it’s too much in an environment like this.</p>
<p>He might be able to do something if he gets the Rankers’ help.</p>
<p>So the Rankers also went out to know how the water pressure feels, and they came back wrung out. They got caught in a 60% restriction.</p>
<p>There are 22 level A Lifers including Cha Jun Sung. Only 22 people can go into battle 4500m in the ocean.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to bring them to 2000m at the least. If it gets deeper, I’ll be the only one who can go out. I can’t go alone. I’ll fall into an intensive attack.”</p>
<p>Odin is looking at level S battlesuit activity as limited at 7000m. He can move if they get deeper. It’s just that he won’t be able to fight.</p>
<p>Even at points when problems with activity came up, Uranos kept searching for where the Deep-Sea Teeth live.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>[We will arrive at location 203. 936. 52. 162 shortly. Switch to battle mode!]</p>
<p>Uranos lowered the radar and put 40% energy into the water barrier. The water barrier’s thickness multiplied a few times.</p>
<p>Radar is activated but there are a lot of bizarre mutants. They can get through the radar’s watch and bring a surprise attack. All of the portholes are open as well. They are ready to fight with power.</p>
<p>[Location approach complete. No detection of mutants like the Deep-Sea Teeth.]</p>
<p>There are weaknesses in the Albatrus’ radar as well. It can search everywhere but if the features get complicated, it gets hard to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>It cannot go through objects. It can’t see through objects.</p>
<p>“Looks like it won’t be easy to find them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. We can make them come out on their own if we can’t find them.”</p>
<p>Is he talking about luring them? How will they do it? The Rankers ask Strategist. They are very curious about how he is thinking of doing it.</p>
<p>“Sea General, you said you found the Deep-Sea Teeth at sea level, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I ran into them when I was going up for light. And after blinking a few times, a pair of Deep-Sea Teeth were standing on either side of a baby.”</p>
<p>He still got in a cold sweat thinking of it. Deep-Sea Teeth are atrocious. It is a wonder that they don’t attack submarines.</p>
<p>“Baby. Baby.”</p>
<p>Humans and mutants alike are weak to babies.</p>
<p>A period when curiosity is highest. A baby in this period is like a ticking time bomb. There’s no way to know what will happen. Parents are busy taking care of it.</p>
<p>“The mutant’s ecosystem is the law of the jungle. If the baby went all the way up to sea level, either the parents allowed it or it acted on its own.”</p>
<p>They cannot overcome the situation if they allowed it, but what if it acted on its own? Strategist thought of an incredible idea while worrying it might be the latter.</p>
<p>“You all have plenty of stamina, right?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Strategist smiles in response to Nuclear’s question.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is covered in mutants, but the ocean is beautiful. The sunlight reflecting off the blue waves is magnificent! This magnificence is painted with red.</p>
<p>Countless mutants swarm in near the red water. Fish as big as a human arms scatter the red water; large fish swallow those fish; and larger fish swallow those fish.</p>
<p>The mutants eat and get eaten, but they go crazy for the red water anyway. The hair-raisingly pure and delicate smell makes them all crazy.</p>
<p>The powerful smell of blood that they have never smelled before makes two different creatures come in unlike the mutants going crazy at the scene.</p>
<p>Those comparatively close and those far away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The female Deep-Sea Teeth had been resting comfortably deep inside the underwater cave when a fin that ran from her face to tail stiffened. A smell more seductive than when she had met the male, is paralyzing her senses. It’s so tempting that it makes her forget what is going on around her.</p>
<p>The female shakes her head. She barely overcame the urge, but she can’t stop her mouth from watering. Food that gives off this kind of smell!</p>
<p>The female looks outside the cave. She is deep inside but the cave is open in a straight line, so she can see what is outside for the most part.</p>
<p>She jumps in surprise. She opens her eyes wide, and moves her nearly 200m body out of the cave. She moves at a very fast speed.</p>
<p>Her level 8 roar draws a concentric circle as it goes through the ocean. Her call of ‘hurry up and come,’ ‘something’s happened’ is for the male.</p>
<p>While calling for the male, the female keeps circling near the cave. The baby had just been playing nearby, but had disappeared.</p>
<p>This is the first time she has ever lost the baby. She’s never been able to lose the child because her focus is always on it.</p>
<p>Bang</p>
<p>Her caudal fin hits the peak of a nearby underwater mountain.</p>
<p>A crater forms in the middle and rocks weighing in the tons roll down.</p>
<p>The male is here. He has a starfish that is nearly 40m in size in his mouth. It is switching between five colors, and it is a level 7 Five Color Fish.</p>
<p>There is a small wound on the male’s body. He got it while catching the Five Color Fish. rather than blame each other, they started to search the entire area for the baby. Then the female turned her head up.</p>
<p>The smell of blood that tempted her as an adult! If it had made her so disoriented as to make her lose her child, how would it have been to the child?</p>
<p>The male threw the Five Color Fish to the side and soared up. He also smelled what the female did.</p>
<p>The female goes after him. There aren’t many enemies that would harm their child but it’s not like there are none, so one of them needs to stay with it.</p>
<p>If the child had been seduced by the smell of blood, there will be a lot of enemies nearby. They are in a rush. They can’t leave the child alone or put their guard down until it is about half their size.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Is that it?”</p>
<p>“That is without a doubt the baby Deep-Sea Teeth. To think that this worked!”</p>
<p>Sea General couldn’t help but laugh at Strategist’s absurd trap. There was nothing difficult about it. Strategist took blood from Lifers for the past few days. Normally, people would rest for a few months after one transfusion.</p>
<p>However, the Lifers who came into the mission have all completed beyond stage 5 of body modifications, and are superhumans who have succeeded human ability.</p>
<p>They recover several hours after giving blood. After taking blood like that, they had a little over 1000L. They left Cha Jun Sung out of this. They don’t know what problems could arise.</p>
<p>They poured that 1000L of blood into a 300m area that is optimal for battle. They left the Albatrus anchored nearby.</p>
<p>They left only the functions inside on and turned off anything that showed on the outside, so it just looked like a giant rock or mountain to mutants.</p>
<p>The fish started biting after they poured out 200L. Mutants came in, crazed by the smell of blood.</p>
<p>Lifers know how mutants react to human blood, so they often use this method.</p>
<p>But they hadn’t expected it to work on a level 8 baby. Whatever the level or species, a baby is a baby. The funny thing is that Lifers’ blood works on mutants.</p>
<p>They have also been infected with A virus, but human blood strangely has the same effect on mutants. Of course Lifers with the exception of Cha Jun Sung’s group don’t know that the transplanted cells they received while going through body modifications had A virus in them.</p>
<p>There are just those who think that this might be the case. Regardless, they did not pour out all of the blood at one time.</p>
<p>The mutants killed each other and mixed with the contaminated blood. So the Lifers moved around to pour out the blood so it wouldn’t get mixed up.</p>
<p>They would return to the Albatrus once they were done. After repeating this a few times, the baby Deep-Sea Teeth appeared.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Uranos used more than 50% of the energy on the radar. The extensively broadened sonar searches over a 100km radius.</p>
<p>The picture on a 3D hologram video changes every hour. It checks the shape of mutants captured on radar in real time. The terrain was examined in another place. They moved at the lowest altitude they could, close to the sea floor. They went deeper and deeper.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was curious about the imposing water pressure at 4500m into the sea, so he went outside even though there was no battle.</p>
<p>“My joints hurt. It’d be better for level B Lifers to stay on board.”</p>
<p>It’s water pressure that level B battlesuits can’t withstand. They need to be level A at the least. The 30% restriction that gets them as soon as they go out. It’ll be 50% for level A.</p>
<p>If they had been on land, they would be able to take on level 8-s – even mutants on the level of Red Eye – but it’s too much in an environment like this.</p>
<p>He might be able to do something if he gets the Rankers’ help.</p>
<p>So the Rankers also went out to know how the water pressure feels, and they came back wrung out. They got caught in a 60% restriction.</p>
<p>There are 22 level A Lifers including Cha Jun Sung. Only 22 people can go into battle 4500m in the ocean.</p>
<p>“We’ll have to bring them to 2000m at the least. If it gets deeper, I’ll be the only one who can go out. I can’t go alone. I’ll fall into an intensive attack.”</p>
<p>Odin is looking at level S battlesuit activity as limited at 7000m. He can move if they get deeper. It’s just that he won’t be able to fight.</p>
<p>Even at points when problems with activity came up, Uranos kept searching for where the Deep-Sea Teeth live.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>[We will arrive at location 203. 936. 52. 162 shortly. Switch to battle mode!]</p>
<p>Uranos lowered the radar and put 40% energy into the water barrier. The water barrier’s thickness multiplied a few times.</p>
<p>Radar is activated but there are a lot of bizarre mutants. They can get through the radar’s watch and bring a surprise attack. All of the portholes are open as well. They are ready to fight with power.</p>
<p>[Location approach complete. No detection of mutants like the Deep-Sea Teeth.]</p>
<p>There are weaknesses in the Albatrus’ radar as well. It can search everywhere but if the features get complicated, it gets hard to distinguish between them.</p>
<p>It cannot go through objects. It can’t see through objects.</p>
<p>“Looks like it won’t be easy to find them.”</p>
<p>“I don’t care. We can make them come out on their own if we can’t find them.”</p>
<p>Is he talking about luring them? How will they do it? The Rankers ask Strategist. They are very curious about how he is thinking of doing it.</p>
<p>“Sea General, you said you found the Deep-Sea Teeth at sea level, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I ran into them when I was going up for light. And after blinking a few times, a pair of Deep-Sea Teeth were standing on either side of a baby.”</p>
<p>He still got in a cold sweat thinking of it. Deep-Sea Teeth are atrocious. It is a wonder that they don’t attack submarines.</p>
<p>“Baby. Baby.”</p>
<p>Humans and mutants alike are weak to babies.</p>
<p>A period when curiosity is highest. A baby in this period is like a ticking time bomb. There’s no way to know what will happen. Parents are busy taking care of it.</p>
<p>“The mutant’s ecosystem is the law of the jungle. If the baby went all the way up to sea level, either the parents allowed it or it acted on its own.”</p>
<p>They cannot overcome the situation if they allowed it, but what if it acted on its own? Strategist thought of an incredible idea while worrying it might be the latter.</p>
<p>“You all have plenty of stamina, right?”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>Strategist smiles in response to Nuclear’s question.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>It is covered in mutants, but the ocean is beautiful. The sunlight reflecting off the blue waves is magnificent! This magnificence is painted with red.</p>
<p>Countless mutants swarm in near the red water. Fish as big as a human arms scatter the red water; large fish swallow those fish; and larger fish swallow those fish.</p>
<p>The mutants eat and get eaten, but they go crazy for the red water anyway. The hair-raisingly pure and delicate smell makes them all crazy.</p>
<p>The powerful smell of blood that they have never smelled before makes two different creatures come in unlike the mutants going crazy at the scene.</p>
<p>Those comparatively close and those far away.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The female Deep-Sea Teeth had been resting comfortably deep inside the underwater cave when a fin that ran from her face to tail stiffened. A smell more seductive than when she had met the male, is paralyzing her senses. It’s so tempting that it makes her forget what is going on around her.</p>
<p>The female shakes her head. She barely overcame the urge, but she can’t stop her mouth from watering. Food that gives off this kind of smell!</p>
<p>The female looks outside the cave. She is deep inside but the cave is open in a straight line, so she can see what is outside for the most part.</p>
<p>She jumps in surprise. She opens her eyes wide, and moves her nearly 200m body out of the cave. She moves at a very fast speed.</p>

<p>Chapter 226</p>
<p>“It is a shark, but it’s like it’s heavily drugged. Like an addict.”</p>
<p>These are Park Jin Hyuk’s thoughts on the baby Deep-Sea Teeth he sees in the mirror image. It looks like a shark on the outside. Like all other mutants however, it isn’t normal. It has the slick lines of a fish. But it is muscular as if it is on steroids.</p>
<p>The crazy thing is that it is a baby that will get much bigger from here.</p>
<p>Sea General said that an adult Deep-Sea Teeth is at least 150m. That means it’s one of the biggest mutants.</p>
<p>It is smaller than Hell Mammoth and Blood Lord, but it can be expected to be similar since he said ‘at least’. Even the baby looks to be about 30m. Mutants are all strength. It is just a baby, but it is larger than the Megalodon, a species that dates back tens of thousands of years.</p>
<p>If it were human, it would have been born with a silver spoon.</p>
<p>“Just looking it over, it looks like it’ll be stronger than a level 6, but weaker than a level 7.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stretches his body. His mission. Capture the baby. There are a lot of issues with using the Albatrus to catch it.</p>
<p>The goal is simple. He needs to bring it where the Albatrus is anchored, not even 50m deep into the water. They won’t be able to communicate, so he needs to injure it so that it doesn’t die but so that it cannot move. They will commence battle as soon as the Deep-Sea Teeth arrive.</p>
<p>The baby had no idea what was about to happen to it, and indiscriminately ripped apart the mutants swimming in the Lifers’ blood in order to have all the blood for itself.</p>
<p>It is young, but the blood of a level 8 does not go anywhere. It has a weak yet present desire to establish itself as a predator.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The Albatrus’ ceiling opens. Cha Jun Sung shoots out like a missile.</p>
<p>It is 300m deep. With the Albatrus at 250m, there is no reason to go through the ocean. It’ll just leave a watercourse.</p>
<p>[Function switch! Power mode!]</p>
<p>Particles in the nanometers compress and the battlesuit becomes full. It has changed to adjust to the maximized power.</p>
<p>“I’ll play with you until your mom and dad get here. Though you’ll never want to play again.”</p>
<p>He looks like an eagle going after its prey. Cha Jun Sung was floating in the air when he plummeted toward the baby playing in the red water. The baby didn’t bother with him. It just thought that he was a strange bird.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s body slam went through the water and collided with the baby’s back. The back twists abnormally. Its spine broke under the crash.</p>
<p>The baby’s eyes roll back and its body trembles in pain. Cha Jun Sung doesn’t pay attention, and grabs its tail. Switching the function doesn’t have a clear effect when fighting against a strong opponent. Power gets specialized, so it is good to use only when that function is necessary.</p>
<p>Like now with the power mode when he needs maximum strength.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung whips the tail. He slams the baby into a shallow area as though practicing judo. Its weight is in the tons, but the battlesuit as a product of science and his stage 10 body modifications make this possible.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung laughs as he watches the baby suffer. If it is here, it won’t be able to sink too low.</p>
<p>He won’t leave it so they can take it away. Unless the Deep-Sea Teeth intend to abandon the baby, they will need to fight the Lifers to the end.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung! There is a strong vital reaction coming from below!]</p>
<p>Instead of responding to Odin’s warning, Cha Jun Sung turned the Overbooster on and went up into the sky. At that moment, the sea opens up and a monster appears. A giant shadow forms on the water. The male Deep-Sea Teeth left the baby and jumped in order to catch Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>The 200m body uses its tail strength to jump out. Cha Jun Sung couldn’t stop his Overbooster.</p>
<p>The second he does, he will be sucked into its abyss of a throat.</p>
<p>“I’ll start since you attacked, alright?”</p>
<p>Gravity pulls the male back down. Cha Jun Sung stopped running away and turned on the reverse booster to fly right in front of the male’s nose.</p>
<p>Overhead kick. Cha Jun Sung spun his body in the air, stood backwards, and kicked with the Overbooster’s power.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The shock from his foot crushes the male’s nose. It was on the verge of regenerating, but this is just the start. It got swept without being able to recover its body.</p>
<p>The male had been up at bat first. The female swoops in to attack after waiting under sea level.</p>
<p>[Level A special mission Deep-Sea Teeth is being applied! Measuring difficulty, advancement! Authority approval! Advancement system applied with level 8 overlap!]</p>
<p>[Level A special mission: Deep-Sea Teeth] [Goal: Attainment]</p>
<p>[Description: The wide sea is as ferocious as land. The ocean could even be more ferocious than land. In the middle of the ocean, one of the three predators dividing the Pacific Ocean is the Deep-Sea Teeth aka Shark Kings. Break the teeth of these vicious tyrants!] [Reward: 80,000,000,000 points. Lucky box.]</p>
<p>It is an advancement. 80 trillion reward points. This is more than what he got for Vanessa. It seems he is being given more points because of the geographical disadvantage. If it had just been one, how many points would they have given him? They would have given him 20 to 30 trillion, right?</p>
<p>Boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>While the advancement special mission was being applied, Lifers poured out of the Albatrus. He succeeded in luring the Deep-Sea Teeth to sea level.</p>
<p>It isn’t easy to take on two Deep-Sea Teeth at the same time with the power of the Albatrus. The ship and Lifers need to fight from their respective positions.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>The Albatrus operates its engine. As the porthole opens, 300 submersibles scatter out. It is total war. They intend on using everything.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The Albatrus showed itself at sea level, went in reverse, and fires the hydraulic guns and hydraulic impact guns. 100 portholes explode without stopping. A black horde of sharks hesitated under the power of the hydraulic guns.</p>
<p>That was just momentary.</p>
<p>They show their sharp teeth. Sacrifices are a given to take down an enemy. They advance with their peers as a shield.</p>
<p>300 submersibles build a low line of defense, but they get destroyed one at a time like with the Turtle Babies.</p>
<p>They are both mutants, but sharks and mutants are different species.</p>
<p>Unlike turtles, sharks – white sharks in particular – had a bad reputation even before they became mutants. Now that they are mutants, they have become more fierce and go after their prey even at the risk of death.</p>
<p>[Perspective mode!]</p>
<p>“Block them so they can’t get to the ship!”</p>
<p>More than 900 level B Lifers are on top of the Albatrus as they use distance weapons like reinforced rifles to attack the swarm of sharks. One person couldn’t find a place to install an automatic cannon, and instead held it himself as it fired. They can tell what direction the sharks are coming because of the perspective mode.</p>
<p>The smell of gunpowder permeates the battlefield. Casings fall through the ocean. They even threw bombs and loaded bazookas. Advanced cyborgs that aren’t helpful in battle, kept providing those Lifers with supplies so that they wouldn’t run out.</p>
<p>They have items that they need on the spot in their space compression bags, but they need to use what can be supplied easiest at the end so that they can last for a long time.</p>
<p>They can’t provide time for the sharks to get near while they reinforce their supplies.</p>
<p>[Warning! Below sea level! Multiple enemies appearing below the Albatrus!]</p>
<p>“Fuck!”</p>
<p>“Damn!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Lifers curse. It seems like they are gathered together at random, but they are divided into forces and they each have their own roles. Two of the forces attacking the front from the top, 200 Lifers turn their boosters on and dove into the sea without delay.</p>
<p>They are incomparably less compared to those at sea level, but another group of about 5000 sharks is coming up at them.</p>
<p>Even though they try to fire at them in order to stop their approach and to decrease their numbers, it isn’t possible to do with 200 people. But that doesn’t mean they can call for backup. It is worse at sea level.</p>
<p>“Damn it! Die!”</p>
<p>“I’m going!”</p>
<p>15 parties of the 200 Lifers, 150 people took out vibrating weapons. 50 people are still pulling the trigger from a distance.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>500 mutants, most of which are levels 3 and 4 with very few levels 5 and 6-s collide with 150 level B Lifers who are stronger than level 6-s.</p>
<p>Dozens of mutants per person. They would have been fighting with easy steps and weapon switches if they had been on land, but this is the ocean.</p>
<p>Lifers couldn’t remain whole with the onslaught of sharks coming from all directions.</p>
<p>One Lifer lost an arm while fighting level 5 and 6-s alone. He would have been shredded already if it hadn’t been for his battlesuit.</p>
<p>The Lifers are only thinking one thing. Not to die even if their arms and legs get cut off.</p>
<p>And they were hoping for the Rankers to hurry up and end this hell of a fight for them. But the place that was worse than sea level was the Rankers’ battlefield.</p>
<p>Lifers and mutants alike couldn’t approach that battlefield.</p>
<p>There are 22 people. It is a small number, and they are taking on a pair of Deep-Sea Teeth and 7 level 7-s.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ghost Gun Lim Si Hyun moves through the ocean with his revolver, an automatic pistol and deathblow for control rather than killing.</p>
<p>Shadow moving.</p>
<p>It is a skill that Ghost Gun’s 9 combination battlesuit has. The combinations are not for attacking by foot, but shadow moving focused on evasion.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>As he retreats, a pointy dorsal fin is following him. It goes through the water as it chases the shadow moving.</p>
<p>Lim Si Hyun didn’t look forward as he ran. There are no obstacles in his way, so he can move backwards while attacking with his automatic pistol.</p>
<p>Level 7 Blade Shark.</p>
<p>It is a nimble mutant that uses its sharp dorsal fin to cut its opponent rather than the shark specialty of ripping them apart. The dorsal fin is 5m high and more than 20m long. Looking at just its back, it is a giant sword. It’s big enough to sink a large yacht.</p>
<p>Lim Si Hyun quickly changes the magazines for his automatic pistol and revolver. It’s a pistol, but it’s as big as a person. The weight of the two guns combined is close to 100kg.</p>
<p>“Leave those to them. I’ll take this one.”</p>
<p>Lim Si Hyun focused on his opponent, the Blade Shark. A special mission was activated as soon as Cha Jun Sung was attacked by the Deep-Sea Teeth.</p>
<p>There had been a signal for the start of the battle. Lifers immediately scrambled, and hordes of sharks came in from everywhere within an hour.</p>
<p>The pair of Deep-Sea Teeth, like a trisection of the Pacific Ocean predators they are, they have countless underlings. The baby is in pain, trying to regenerate. They need to go help it, but there are too many obstacles stopping them.</p>
<p>The swarm of sharks that responded to the hair raising roar of the level 8 took on the level B Lifers and Albatrus. There is nothing they can do.</p>
<p>A few Rankers tried to help, but their situation isn’t great either. In the swarm of sharks, there are 7 level 7-s as well.</p>
<p>They were all sharks and as much as they looked different, they had various abilities. If there are fast and sharp ones like Blade Shark, there are also ones that are slow but with excellent defense capabilities.</p>
<p>So the Rankers each took charge of the mutants that they could handle, and lured them away to an area where they could fight comfortably. Each fought their best. Cha Jun Sung took one level 8. The other 13 people took another one. Kyoko is a level A Lifer, but she cannot fight because she is a medic.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>The shadow moving becomes elaborate. Lim Si Hyun’s body fades and divides into dozens. He hadn’t really been divided into pieces.</p>
<p>The Blade Shark wasn’t taken aback. It just saw everything as the enemy and attacked. There is one main body, and the rest is an effect. It was in vain.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>The wave that the Deep-Sea Teeth generated split the vacuum wave that Cha Jun Sung’s Hades created, creating an eardrum shaking roar.</p>
<p>Lim Si Hyun turned his head subconsciously while focusing on the Blade Shark. His attention turned without his will. Cha Jun Sung is taking on a level 8 that they could not take on while on land, in the sea.</p>
<p>He doesn’t retreat. He is confronting it head on.</p>
<p>And next to them, 13 Rankers who are geared more toward group action are confusing a giant Deep-Sea Teeth.</p>
<p>Among them is Park Jin Hyuk’s group, Cha Jun Sung’s party members.</p>
<p>“With a level A store… is this the limit?”</p>
<p>The standard of level A is pioneering.</p>
<p>They cannot take on level 8 with this kind of strength. They need to become complete level S in order to gain the strength to fight against level 8.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know about level 9.</p>
<p>He’s never seen one for himself and even in the virtual version, Cha Jun Sung is the only one who succeeded in a raid. Cha Jun Sung will be able to compare them.</p>
<p>“We’re in the middle.”</p>
<p>The Rankers’ abilities are stuck between levels 7 and 8.</p>
<p>How strong is Cha Jun Sung?</p>
<p>Would he have recovered his abilities from the virtual version? They’ll be able to know by watching him.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 227</p>
<p>“Freezing field.”</p>
<p>Ice Queen’s battlesuit emits a chill that is almost at absolute zero.</p>
<p>The surrounding water freezes.</p>
<p>It is nearly on a scale of hundreds of meters. An ice island forms in the middle of the open sea.</p>
<p>The female Deep-Sea Teeth twists her giant body. The freezing field spreads like an epidemic and has an effect on the female’s body.</p>
<p>It has a power that would make most mutants below level 7 into ice statues, but it doesn’t have the same effect on level 8-s.</p>
<p>The female’s movements grew slower as it continued to be exposed to the freezing field. Its muscles had stiffened from the chill.</p>
<p>“Buster blaze.”</p>
<p>“Chunmapo.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Boom Buster and Glare Gun combine the hand cannons they had in each hand into one. A beam comes out of a muzzle that is 1m in diameter.</p>
<p>The female’s body takes a hit from the beam and becomes dented. It is so big that it is impossible to create a wound with even a 9 combination offensive skill.</p>
<p>“Energy explosion.”</p>
<p>Nuclear concentrates the energy to his right hand.</p>
<p>Then a round, blue sphere as big as his head came up and compressed to the size of his fist.</p>
<p>It is a bomb.</p>
<p>It isn’t something he bought from the store.</p>
<p>It is a kind of energy ball that is created by grafting together the battlesuit’s energy and various techniques.</p>
<p>It’s power depends on the amount of energy that is poured into it. Maximum energy can topple a whole building.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Nuclear’s energy ball enters the wound that is forming, and explodes. Large chunks of flesh scatter all over the ocean. Most of the Rankers battling the female are long-distance fighters. This is more advantageous because there isn’t anywhere to stand and fight.</p>
<p>Weapon Master, Chamma Sword, Dual Blade, Longines, Ghost Gun, Nile Tail, and Black Panther are fighting level 7-s somewhere.</p>
<p>That doesn’t mean they can ignore close-range fighting.</p>
<p>The barrier needs to be firm so that those supporting from behind can feel at ease.</p>
<p>Han Chang Jin, who is wearing a battlesuit half times larger than those of other Rankers and even Cha Jun Sung’s, takes on the female’s attack.</p>
<p>The battlesuit’s surface is covered in silver metal. It is an iron defense characteristic with defense specialization of outer armor reinforcement.</p>
<p>Han Chang Jin put a thick chain through the female’s mouth and blocked it so it couldn’t dive.</p>
<p>It is impossible for him to do alone because of the difference in mass.</p>
<p>He placed a restriction on its movement like Ice Queen did so that the Rankers would be stuck to it and engage in a power contest as though fishing if it dives.</p>
<p>They got dragged that much, but the female didn’t create enough distance to run from the Rankers. She can’t abandon the baby.</p>
<p>There hadn’t been anything on the female’s back, but a deep cut formed near the dorsal fin and blood spilled out. Basil had approached in stealth mode.</p>
<p>The Rankers were well coordinated.</p>
<p>They used each of their abilities effectively, so they complemented each other’s disadvantages and maximized the advantages.</p>
<p>Each individual has their own clear characteristics, but it isn’t a mission that they can complete by doing well alone. It is a level A advancement. Park Jin Hyuk’s group refrained from personal behavior and increased power through team play. They were doing well without any problems until now.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>“Oh. The Albatrus is getting pushed.”</p>
<p>The Deep-Sea Teeth called in too many sharks. It had already been long since the water near the Albatrus had been filled with the blood of sharks and Lifers.</p>
<p>Swarm of sharks got through the hail of bullets and submersibles barrier, aiming for the Albatrus that is being protected with a warrior barrier.</p>
<p>Due to the nature of the ship, it will be hard to handle if the battle gets into a second melee. Lifers take out their reinforced rifles and vibrating weapons, and dive.</p>
<p>There was no reason for them to get attacked when bringing on the long-distance attack, but the number of injured and dead is increasing as they take on the sharks.</p>
<p>‘Who do we need to take out?’</p>
<p>Strategist’s brain starts to turn. Ice Queen is optimal. If she wraps the Albatrus with a freezing field, it can endure the shark attack.</p>
<p>However, Ice Queen is the most important debuff Lifer in fighting against the Deep-Sea Teeth. Her role is as important as Han Chang Jin’s. Her presence decreased the Deep-Sea Teeth’s power by 20%.</p>
<p>‘It’ll take time for these people fighting against level 7-s, so we need to take out at least 2 people.’</p>
<p>Strategist chose himself as one. They are fighting so well that he doesn’t need to orchestrate the battle. Who should the other person be?</p>
<p>“I’ll go.”</p>
<p>Kyoko appears in front of Strategist. She is least important of the 13 in battle. She has a greater role in support than in direct battle.</p>
<p>Strategist hadn’t thought of her because though she is a level A Lifer, her battlesuit has been renovated for medical technology.</p>
<p>“Jin Hyuk taught me how to shoot, so I’ll be able to hold my own.”</p>
<p>Kyoko takes a Diablo, a level A store sniper rifle, from her space compression bag. It has explosive power, so it is effective if used well.</p>
<p>“Alright. The two of us will go.”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk worried about Kyoko separating from himself, but he didn’t show it. As long as they have entered the mission, she needs to do her part as well.</p>
<p>Strategist and Kyoko retreat to support the Albatrus. The number of Lifers has visibly decreased. It seems at least 300 people have died.</p>
<p>The battle isn’t over. They can’t tell how many people will die going forward.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Han Chang Jin gets hit with the female’s tail and goes flying.</p>
<p>He was flung with the fearsome power as if he were a pebble.</p>
<p>He went flying easily 500 to 600m.</p>
<p>The iron defense is protecting his body, but it is an attack weighing millions of tons. The impact will be big.</p>
<p>The female threw Han Chang Jin, and her next target is Ice Queen.</p>
<p>She had prioritized who to kill while fighting. These are the top two.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Another hit with the tail. A tidal wave comes in.</p>
<p>Boom Buster and Glare Gun raise the hand cannon. All they have to do is vaporize or explode.</p>
<p>“Run!”</p>
<p>Nuclear yells.</p>
<p>Behind the wave, the 200m large female tries to jump into the Rankers.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The weight isn’t convertible, but it presses the sea level and creates an incredible shockwave. A ripple will form even when a pebble is thrown into a calm lake.</p>
<p>The waves of the sea aren’t calm, but the aftermath is crazy.</p>
<p>“Is everyone okay?”</p>
<p>“We’re okay. This is insane. Overload taking a monster like that alone!”</p>
<p>Glare Gun spoke as though sick of it.</p>
<p>With Strategist and Kyoko out, there are 11 people. Those 11 people are battling one level 8.</p>
<p>“Why isn’t it coming out?”</p>
<p>It needs to come out if it went in, but it isn’t showing itself.</p>
<p>Did it leave the baby and run away?</p>
<p>That isn’t it.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is still fighting with the male.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group and the Rankers went into the sky. Deep-Sea Teeth are big, so their shadows inevitably show if they are swimming near sea level.</p>
<p>“It’s coming.”</p>
<p>Something is coming up.</p>
<p>Is it the female?</p>
<p>They predict it to be the female.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>It is a giant water column. It is similar to the Turtle Babies that the Captain Turtles shot out. Half of the 11 people were swept under the water column.</p>
<p>Water pressure that can crush a battlesuit.</p>
<p>5 people couldn’t balance, and fall to the sea. From below, the female soars up with her mouth open.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Someone flew toward the female’s face, and brought down a weapon. A wound deeper and wider than the weapon forms.</p>
<p>The female falls out of the direction of her attack from the pain on her face. Park Jin Hyuk’s group saw the person who helped them, and their faces brighten.</p>
<p>“Take the people who fell back, and reorganize. I’ll block her.”</p>
<p>It is Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>The battle against the male was very simple. He didn’t need to be calculating like he had been with Narsiel and Vanessa.</p>
<p>It is because he had lured it near sea level.</p>
<p>If he had been fighting deep in the sea where he needed to endure the water pressure, this wouldn’t have happened. Even the Albatrus was being pushed back.</p>
<p>The male had followed Cha Jun Sung, and shot a water cannon. It must be able to adjust the pressure, because it shot in spurts like a gun instead of shooting out in one long stream.</p>
<p>It might look tacky, but it has decent destructive power.</p>
<p>Each one could destroy a car.</p>
<p>‘Pattern input complete.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is sure.</p>
<p>As long as the Albatrus hangs on, he, Park Jin Hyuk’s group, and Rankers can take care of this. It won’t take a long time.</p>
<p>The male and female surround Cha Jun Sung from the front and back. He is relaxed.</p>
<p>“Idiots. Big guys like you aren’t suited for team play against small opponents like me.”</p>
<p>There is a lot that they occupy, but there isn’t much that they can attack.</p>
<p>They end up crashing whether they like it or not. On the other hand, there aren’t many places where they can hit Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Those two huge bodies will get hit even if he shoots at them with his eyes closed.</p>
<p>“Environment is important too. Do you understand me?”</p>
<p>There is an unmistakable homeground advantage. Just as people can’t use their strength underwater, fish can’t use their strength outside of the water.</p>
<p>Sea level isn’t outside water, but the Lifers who are capable of battling in flight were able to escape the bothersome water pressure and recover some amount of freedom.</p>
<p>It is an environment in which they are at an absolute disadvantage. Strategist’s thinking had brought them to a place where they could be equals even if they couldn’t be at an advantage.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung watched the male and female pair growling in front of him, and took a deep breath.</p>
<p>He’ll be level S as long as he finishes this. There’s no higher from there.</p>
<p>He has enough points to go shopping in the level S store as well. If he eats those guys and combines the reward points, he could have over 20 billion.</p>
<p>“I wonder. What’ll it be like after if I kill Evil Queen.”</p>
<p>If he completes level S missions and kills all the level 9-s, will that be the end of Life Mission? Is there an end to Life Mission?</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stopped thinking and threw his body. If he started something, he needs to end it. When he attacked, Park Jin Hyuk’s group and the Rankers also started attacking with their guns.</p>
<p>“Be my foothold.”</p>
<p>There’s no point even if they reject this.</p>
<p>He isn’t doing this with the intention of getting permission.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 228</p>
<p>An unmeasurable giant creature cuts through the ocean.</p>
<p>It moves like a threaded needle going back and forth, sewing cloth.</p>
<p>It is foolish to even compare because of the size of the ocean, but just that area looked like it was being threaded.</p>
<p>The body movement itself is slow.</p>
<p>It looks very slow. But each movement brings it forward hundreds of meters in distance.</p>
<p>It was going back because of a sweet smell. It is curious because it’s something it’s smelling for the first time, but it doesn’t get seduced.</p>
<p>It is a ruler.</p>
<p>Nothing can distract its composure.</p>
<p>The creature stopped moving. The sweet smell is slowly fading.</p>
<p>Instead, the smell of those guys it ran into not long ago becomes stronger.</p>
<p>A fairly strong male and female pair.</p>
<p>It has been wandering the sea for a long time, but they are some of the strongest they have seen until now.</p>
<p>It’s sure that nothing in this ocean can take them on.</p>
<p>What is going on over there?</p>
<p>It isn’t sure, but it is sure of one thing. Something exciting is waiting.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang bang!</p>
<p>Nuclear’s energy ball gets embedded in the male’s pupil.</p>
<p>He used most of the energy left in his battlesuit. An increase in destructive power is inevitable, and the flesh scatters.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>It is out of energy.</p>
<p>The male is unable to regenerate the area where its eye has exploded, and flips with its stomach turned up. It floats on the water and breathes heavily.</p>
<p>It’s body is covered in wounds from cuts and bombs.</p>
<p>The male looked from one place to another. It has seen the dead female and baby. It was about to follow them.</p>
<p>“Farewell.”</p>
<p>Hades cuts the male’s neck with wind pressure.</p>
<p>They couldn’t dissect it due to its size, but the trajectory of the vacuum wave gave the final blow.</p>
<p>[You have killed the Deep-Sea Teeth. You have earned 2.5 billion points and 5 billion achievement points. You have completed the level A advancement mission, Deep-Sea Teeth. You have earned 8 billion reward points. Cha Jun Sung is subject to upgrade – level S missions and store have been opened.]</p>
<p>As everyone had expected, Cha Jun Sung was the only one to advance.</p>
<p>If it hadn’t been for Cha Jun Sung, it could have been someone else.</p>
<p>The battle would have been more fierce with the absence of a strong power. There would have been more sacrifices made, and someone would have stepped up.</p>
<p>“I – I can’t fight anymore.”</p>
<p>“Phew! It’s done anyway.”</p>
<p>The ice island that Ice Queen created near the male is visible.</p>
<p>It is about 1/10 of the size it normally is because she lacked the energy.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group and the Rankers are spread out on that small island. It is a terrible sight. A majority of the battlesuits are severely damaged.</p>
<p>The aftermath of battle.</p>
<p>It is a big show.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung, 11 Lifers and two level 8-s had incredible pressure in frontal confrontation regardless of winners and losers.</p>
<p>They wanted to fight by hitting and retreating even if this takes some time, but it isn’t a situation where they can do that. The Albatrus is getting pushed.</p>
<p>They need to finish up the battle here somehow and then help out on that side.</p>
<p>But once the battle with the Deep-Sea Teeth was over, only one person was able to move and he was already on his way to help.</p>
<p>“He flies.”</p>
<p>“His stamina is one thing, but we can’t ignore his battlesuit’s performance either.”</p>
<p>The Lifers resting on the ice island all look at one place.</p>
<p>As soon as Cha Jun Sung killed the male and arrived at the Albatrus, he swept the battlefield.</p>
<p>The sharks are scattering everywhere following the Deep-Sea Teeth’s loss, but it’s slow because there are so many of them.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk’s group and the Rankers took out their general charging devices and recovered their battlesuits’ energy. They already used all of the rapid charging devices.</p>
<p>While Cha Jun Sung attacked near the Albatrus, the 7 Rankers who had gone to take on the level 7-s began to resume their positions one by one.</p>
<p>They aren’t in good shape either, but they are more at ease.</p>
<p>As soon as they joined in battle, they chased the sharks away with Cha Jun Sung as the principal axis.</p>
<p>“Is it… complete.”</p>
<p>Strategist got an idea of the battle’s atmosphere and gave a hollow smile.</p>
<p>He doesn’t remember when it started, but now there are more times when he feels empty due to the death of his colleagues rather than a feeling of achievement that the mission is complete.</p>
<p>Survivors are flowers that bloom from the sacrifices of others. They used those opportunities created through their deaths as footholds to go up.</p>
<p>Those with more, gain more. Those who lose, lose more.</p>
<p>They hadn’t been able to advance, but Strategist’s group completed the mission and survived while earning a vast amount of points. It is sad, but he thinks of it as one step forward while establishing a friendly relationship with Cha Jun Sung who has opened up level S.</p>
<p>If he supports them with level S items, they will be able to develop even more. Completion without victims might even be possible.</p>
<p>“It’s time to go back. Uranos, do your best and wrap up the battlefield.”</p>
<p>[Cyborg ejection.]</p>
<p>The cyborgs remaining on board go out, leaving the mutants alone, and collect and take care of everything related to Lifers.</p>
<p>The victims don’t return and just watch this. They need to get a count of the damage, but at a glance, it looks like half have died.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung recovers Hades, goes up in the air, and goes past the ice island.</p>
<p>He looks at the Deep-Sea Teeth that are dead in different places.</p>
<p>“Parents who think of their children. I guess all living creatures are the same.”</p>
<p>He doesn’t feel sorry or pity or anything. As long as he has entered with the intention to kill, those kinds of feelings are a luxury.</p>
<p>He is just understanding that those guys are struggling to live just like they are.</p>
<p>“Are we the same?”</p>
<p>Lifers don’t know that they’re specimens for experiment either. Cha Jun Sung is the only one who is close to the hidden truth.</p>
<p>[Sincere congratulations. Lifer Cha Jun Sung, I’m proud of you. The only level S Lifer. I knew you could do it.]</p>
<p>It finally became reality for Cha Jun Sung that he had become level S once he heard Odin speak.</p>
<p>He had been busy with battle before, and had ignored the notice even after hearing it. He hadn’t had the chance to check how many points he got and that he had advanced.</p>
<p>How many level S missions are there?</p>
<p>Are there 5 since Cruel King is dead?</p>
<p>Or is it 6 including that cocoon?</p>
<p>He’ll be able to find out more in detail once he returns. His total points are about 20 billion. He bought a battlesuit, so he can pay attention to other areas. He’ll need to take care of the specifications he is lacking in.</p>
<p>[First, let us go back to the Albatrus.]</p>
<p>“Jun Sung! Let’s go back!”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>Strategist’s radio.</p>
<p>Park Jin Hyuk was sitting on the ice island as he called to Cha Jun Sung who is floating in the air. Lifers are returning one by one.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung turned around to go back. Their work is done here.</p>
<p>At that moment, Cha Jun Sung froze as though he had been hit by lightning.</p>
<p>‘What is this? This energy?’</p>
<p>Something he can’t identify is binding him. He wants to turn around and look, but he can’t. His body won’t listen to him.</p>
<p>[Activate the reverse tracking camera!]</p>
<p>Odin realized something strange was going on, and turns on the camera built into the battlesuit.</p>
<p>The cameras change direction and film the rear. Though they only maintained basic functions, to think that they didn’t know until it had approached!</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>The rear view comes up on his battlesuit’s hologram.</p>
<p>It is the open sea, but below sea level, a long and giant shadow shows under the sunlight.</p>
<p>[Infrared ray, thermal detection impossible! It is a mutant that can control its body temperature and assimilate to the environment! Estimated length 1255m. At this kind of size, could it be?]</p>
<p>From the way it hides, it is like Basil’s 9 combination stealth.</p>
<p>He is level S, but it hadn’t been detected by the battlesuit’s basic probe.</p>
<p>His body trembles.</p>
<p>Cold sweat forms on Cha Jun Sung’s entire body.</p>
<p>His mouth dries up. He doesn’t sweat much because he is a mutant and the temperature inside the battlesuit is always controlled, but he can’t help it now.</p>
<p>“Tell Strategist to run away or return to reality immediately.”</p>
<p>[Transferring information… Transmission complete! Lifer Cha Jun Sung, you also need to hurry up and evacuate!]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung shakes his head.</p>
<p>He needs to buy time for them to get away. They’ll all get swept away if he boards the Albatrus.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung dives into the ocean with the reverse booster.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know how this happened. What he is sure of is that it has already happened.</p>
<p>He is submerged in the sea in a tense state.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung saw it.</p>
<p>It is atrocious, but it has arrogant eyes.</p>
<p>Sea God Levadan.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 229</p>
<p>“Good – goodness!”</p>
<p>“It’s – it’s a monster.”</p>
<p>Levadan shows up in the mirror image.</p>
<p>The Lifers on board and Strategist who got information from Cha Jun Sung were able to see Levadan better than Cha Jun Sung could.</p>
<p>1255m in length and 100m in diameter. It looks like a dragon from some comic book or classic novel. That’s Sea God Levadan.</p>
<p>It is a legendary monster.</p>
<p>It has six pairs of horns on its head and looks like a reptile. But the moment they look at it, its eyes make them lose the will to battle.</p>
<p>The blue scales all over its entire body made the Lifers feel sick.</p>
<p>[Levadan! We finally found its location!]</p>
<p>All of the helpers including Uranos said similar words, in a similar tone at the same time as though it had been planned.</p>
<p>The Lifers are taken aback. They found the location?</p>
<p>Levadan wanders around thousands of meters deep into the sea.</p>
<p>Due to this, not even artificial intelligence can find it. It showed itself occasionally, but that was really rare.</p>
<p>It isn’t on land like other level 9-s, so it is hard to find. But for whatever reason, it has appeared in front of the Lifers.</p>
<p>[We need to put a location tracking device on it.]</p>
<p>Uranos shows consciousness.</p>
<p>It falls out of Strategist’s will. But that doesn’t mean he acts however he wants to. One wrong move could mean annihilation.</p>
<p>[Uranos. Lifer Cha Jun Sung says that he will buy time for us to get away.]</p>
<p>[Odin. You must know as well, but this is the perfect opportunity to keep an eye on Levadan, who has been out of our reach. Do you understand what I’m saying?]</p>
<p>Odin agrees with this as well.</p>
<p>Levadan is elusive, popping up in the east and the west. That’s why they hadn’t been able to create missions related to it.</p>
<p>[Wait. It’s something that you all can’t do, so I’ll ask him what he thinks.]</p>
<p>Odin tries Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>He knows the secrets of Life Mission to an extent. Therefore, it is easy to explain when relaying sensitive issues.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is half and half on installing a location tracking device. He’ll fight Levadan if he needs to, but he won’t provoke it first if he doesn’t have to.</p>
<p>[The authority is applying a special mission.]</p>
<p>[Level A advancement mission: Installation of a location tracking device]</p>
<p>– Goal: Attainment</p>
<p>– Description: Install a location tracking device on ruler of the broad sea, Sea God Levadan, and get out of the mission area!</p>
<p>– Reward: 10,000,000,000 points. Lucky box.</p>
<p>It isn’t a level S mission because he isn’t meant to fight.</p>
<p>But the reward for a level A advancement is 10 billion points. It is of an entirely different class. How many points would it have been if he were to kill it? It would be tens of billions of points.</p>
<p>“It’s dangerous to run away in the ocean. Uranos, operate floating mode.”</p>
<p>Floating mode. Albatrus is a submarine.</p>
<p>That means it is inefficient to put all the energy into the booster, but it can fly in the air for even a moment.</p>
<p>No matter how big and strong Levadan is, it cannot fly in the air without wings. He will soar into the air and return to Mechanic City.</p>
<p>“Let’s kill it with spiral swills. There’s no reason to keep saving it.”</p>
<p>“The opponent isn’t good.”</p>
<p>If they fire the spiral swills, it will use all of the ship’s energy. It takes time to fill it up as well. There’s no guarantee that they will hit and kill it. They can’t take the gamble.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Albatrus’ booster tilts vertically and takes the ship 950m into the air.</p>
<p>Levadan isn’t showing any strange movements.</p>
<p>It isn’t here to fight. It has come out of pure curiosity.</p>
<p>The Lifers think differently.</p>
<p>They have a similar mindset as Cha Jun Sung. They won’t hit first if they aren’t provoked. This new phenomenon is interesting as well.</p>
<p>The Albatrus flies.</p>
<p>It goes up hundreds of meters, but they cannot be at ease even if they have gone several kilometers because of Levadan’s length and the breadth of its attack.</p>
<p>Levadan glares and looks over the bloody battlefield. Sharks are either floating or in pieces all over the place. Their king and queen and their baby are dead, too.</p>
<p>[Interesting.]</p>
<p>[Really?]</p>
<p>Levadan is talking to itself, but Cha Jun Sung responds.</p>
<p>Odin raised the volume on the voice amplifier. Cha Jun Sung’s sound becomes amplified by several times.</p>
<p>It is a conversation between mutants.</p>
<p>It is the principle of telepathy. The high and low tones of their growling with emotions mixed in, relay their messages.</p>
<p>[Are you the same race?]</p>
<p>[I’m a human… the same race.]</p>
<p>He isn’t talking about sea mutants. He’s talking about his nature.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was going to say that he is human, but he just admitted it himself.</p>
<p>[This is the first time I’m seeing something like you. What is that? Is that a shell?]</p>
<p>[I guess you could say that.]</p>
<p>[Show your real self. Are you showing yourself to me with a shell?]</p>
<p>[I can’t live in the ocean. Without this, it’s hard for me to breathe.]</p>
<p>He needs to breathe on his own if he releases the battlesuit and awakens, but Cha Jun Sung is a land mutant, so he can’t act freely. He’ll have to swim since he won’t have a booster, and it will get pathetic. He probably won’t be able to show the power of a level 7 either.</p>
<p>[I understand.]</p>
<p>[Why did you come here?]</p>
<p>[I was on my way home when I smelled something sweet. I turned around and came here because I wanted to see what was going on.]</p>
<p>Oh! It seems Lifers’ blood lured Levadan as well. If they had known a level 9 would react, they would have reconsidered using blood as bait.</p>
<p>[Other guys were going to come to, but they decided not to when they realized I was coming. If they had come, you wouldn’t have been able to take them on with your tired body.]</p>
<p>It is fortunate that Levadan has no intention to fight them.</p>
<p>He is confident that he can run away, but he doesn’t know what damages there might be.</p>
<p>Vroom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks up toward the sky.</p>
<p>Albatrus is returning. He is alone. If he returns, they will feel much more liberated.</p>
<p>[I’ll ask. What are you?]</p>
<p>[A hunter.]</p>
<p>[Hunter?]</p>
<p>[I live to hunt, to kill things like you. You’ll be hunted down by us one day too, though it won’t be easy.]</p>
<p>Levadan roars at the sudden provocation.</p>
<p>The sea shakes with sound waves ringing everywhere. It is laughing in disbelief, not in anger.</p>
<p>[Hah! Me? I’m the ruler. Nothing can take me on.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took out a machine the size of a fingernail, and went toward Levadan.</p>
<p>He is doing this because he knows that it doesn’t want to fight.</p>
<p>A weak sense.</p>
<p>It is similar to the proportion of a single grain of sand to a beach, but the Levadan is able to feel even the smallest changes in its body.</p>
<p>[If you keep this piece on you, hunters will go looking for you shortly. Take it off if you’re scared, and keep it on if you’re confident.]</p>
<p>It is a level 9.</p>
<p>It won’t reject him because of its pride.</p>
<p>[My day to day is boring. I’ll enjoy ripping and breaking those that try to challenge me as they did in the past.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went back again. In actuality, he wanted to hurry up and get away.</p>
<p>It is hard to even withstand Levadan’s energy. He is feeling the pressure he felt from Black Lord.</p>
<p>Considering the ocean as an environment, not even Black Lord would be able to beat Levadan in a fight here. No level 9-s really.</p>
<p>[Even being in front of you is tiring. If you allow it, I want to go.]</p>
<p>[Those guys. Did you do that?]</p>
<p>[We combined our strength, but I was at the forefront. Why are you asking?]</p>
<p>Levadan gestures toward the Deep-Sea Teeth. It grows dark.</p>
<p>[Are you strong?]</p>
<p>[Here? In the sea?]</p>
<p>[Your nature itself.]</p>
<p>[Nature? I guess you could say I’m strong. But I can’t beat you.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t show unnecessary pride.</p>
<p>Levadan has the temperament of Black Lord and Red Eye.</p>
<p>[Is that so? Fine. I won’t kill you. But prove it.]</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Levadan’s body compresses and shoots out like a spring. The attacks of giant species usually begin from their bodies.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went back as much as it came at him with his reverse booster.</p>
<p>However, the Levadan is much faster. A 1200m body can’t be ignored.</p>
<p>No matter how diligently an ant moves, it becomes meaningless next to a human step.</p>
<p>Its huge mouth with sharp teeth opens.</p>
<p>Its mouth is several times larger than that of the Deep-Sea Teeth. Cha Jun Sung didn’t avoid it first. The attack range is wide, so he can’t avoid it easily. If that’s the case, it’s better to wait and first figure out where it will attack.</p>
<p>‘It is a simple bodily attack pattern? It’s plenty strong just looking at this, but Lifers could catch it if they came in as a huge group.’</p>
<p>He doesn’t let down his guard. There’s no way a level 9 can only do this much.</p>
<p>The beyond level 7 sea mutant he has seen until now has skills other than bodily attacks like sucking in water pressure and shooting its breath.</p>
<p>If Levadan shoots that, it will show a power that is incomparable to that of its underlings. And he was too right.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>It is a long spear formed out of the water.</p>
<p>Levadan sucked in seawater, didn’t let it out all at once, but fired it little by little as though spitting.</p>
<p>The problem is that the spitting cycle goes four or five times per second. Each spear goes at supersonic speed.</p>
<p>The difficult situation continued.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was busy avoiding them.</p>
<p>He isn’t avoiding them by seeing them with his eyes and hearing them with his ears. It is with his mutant instincts and immediate reactions of his battlesuit. The firing cycles get shorter and shorter. It is like a machine gun.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung hits away the water spears flying at him with Hades.</p>
<p>Incredible repulsive force.</p>
<p>He loses balance because his hands and feet are entangled.</p>
<p>A water spear collides with Cha Jun Sung’s chest. The energy barrier was the first to reduce the shock, and the battlesuit’s armor was the secondary measure to do so.</p>
<p>Even that isn’t enough, so he goes flying far away even with the water’s resistance.</p>
<p>‘I can’t use all of the battlesuit functions because there isn’t enough energy.’</p>
<p>He wasn’t able to go over his gear after battle. He can’t even use 50% power so as of now, he can’t respond to a simple attack.</p>
<p>Levadan goes soaring.</p>
<p>It is going for him while he is struggling to find balance again.</p>
<p>‘Damn it!’</p>
<p>Should he use the reverse booster to get away?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It could be expecting this.</p>
<p>Then he will go in a direction that isn’t expected. Forward.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung goes to meet Levadan. There is embarrassment in Levadan’s eyes.</p>
<p>That small thing is thinking of taking him on?</p>
<p>Hades scrapes by Levadan’s eyes. Then he goes flying high. Levadan struggles in pain and glares up at Cha Jun Sung, who is looking down at it from the sky.</p>
<p>[I’ll let you go. This wound – I won’t heal it and I’ll just leave it. Did you say beings like you will come looking for me? I’ll welcome a challenge any time.]</p>
<p>[You have succeeded in placing a location tracking device on Levadan’s body. You have earned 10 billion reward points.]</p>
<p>He has already opened level S missions and the store, so this does not get replicated.</p>
<p>Only Cha Jun Sung got reward points for the location tracking device.</p>
<p>With this, the cumulative amount is 30 billion. He has gained the foundation to go into a level S mission.</p>
<p>Levadan dives into the sea.</p>
<p>It came here out of curiosity, but it was pretty fun. It came a long distance, but it had its worth.</p>
<p>“There’s really no way to know what’ll happen with this world.”</p>
<p>He entered a mission to advance, but hadn’t dreamed he would meet Levadan.</p>
<p>It is a variable.</p>
<p>If he had been weak, he would have been killed by this variable.</p>
<p>He needs to get stronger. If he wants to stay alive, he needs to get stronger.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was deep in thought, and then went back to reality.</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung opened his eyes however, he wasn’t in reality, the briefing room, or Mechanic City, but in some random place he had never seen before.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 230</p>
<p>“… Where is this?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s eyes and voice are full of wariness.</p>
<p>He did not pull out Hades or show combative behavior however.</p>
<p>He is positive this is an unfamiliar place, but it doesn’t have an atmosphere of danger.</p>
<p>It is just a little uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The three choices for a Lifer who completes a mission are reality, briefing room, and Mechanic City.</p>
<p>There is nothing else.</p>
<p>Of those, the return locations for reality and Mechanic City are different according to summons locations, but they aren’t in places that Lifers don’t know about.</p>
<p>“It this a hotel?”</p>
<p>The overall configuration is that of a large, luxurious room comparable to that of the royal or diamond room of a top hotel.</p>
<p>Its difference from a modern hotel is that it is a little more futuristic.</p>
<p>It is like a newly-built hotel, as if it is completely outfitted in Life Mission store products.</p>
<p>No. It really is.</p>
<p>“Odin. Odin?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung kept calling for Odin, but he doesn’t respond. He looked at his PDA, but it only functions as a watch. It doesn’t do anything.</p>
<p>It won’t go into the store, and he can’t contact Odin. His return is blocked as well.</p>
<p>Only the number indicating the time in reality changes.</p>
<p>“What is it now?”</p>
<p>“I apologize. I invited you, but it isn’t an invitation that I got consent for.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was surprised by the sound coming from behind him, but he didn’t react.</p>
<p>It is just seriousness in which he can’t sense animosity.</p>
<p>“Hologram?”</p>
<p>A hologram in the form of a person, smiles at Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>It is amazingly clear.</p>
<p>It is as though a real person is standing in front of him. It is so clear that if he hadn’t been wearing his battlesuit or if he wasn’t a Lifer who had gone through body modifications, he wouldn’t have been able to tell if it were a real or virtual image.</p>
<p>“I’ll apologize once more. It is bad manners not to go out to greet a guest, but please understand that I cannot do that.”</p>
<p>“What are you?”</p>
<p>It is a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>He looked older than himself, so Cha Jun Sung addressed him as an elder.</p>
<p>“We don’t have much time. I don’t know if I’ll have enough time to explain everything. Take a seat.”</p>
<p>The man walks.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung follows. He directed Cha Jun Sung to sit across from him in a gentleman-like gesture.</p>
<p>“I’ll skip the small talk and get straight to the point. Odin will explain the rest.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung nods.</p>
<p>If time is limited, he needs to hear what is important.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung doesn’t know anything at this point, not even why he is in this place.</p>
<p>However, he doesn’t need to hear the information he can get from Odin. He’ll hear what he can’t from this man, and then fit everything together like a puzzle.</p>
<p>“Great. You make decisions quickly. I didn’t know we’d meet like this, but it’s a pleasure. I’m Jigneon, the General Manager of Life Mission.”</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Meeting General Manager Jigneon.</p>
<p>The chance of this happening is like that of getting stabbed randomly in the street. But even if Cha Jun Sung had been expecting this to happen, he would have been surprised anyway.</p>
<p>The person who created Life Mission, which is inexplicable with modern science and is something that might appear in the story of a novel, is right in front of Cha Jun Sung’s eyes.</p>
<p>And that person is telling him something incredible.</p>
<p>“Are you saying that this Borteth went against a promise the supervisors made, got out of control, and ‘started interfering’?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>
<p>“But this sounds like an issue within your group. Why are you telling me? The officials can just figure it out among themselves.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung shows a little antipathy toward Jigneon. He is going through missions of his own will, but he doesn’t like that he is being used as a specimen for experiment.</p>
<p>Jigneon didn’t continue speaking right away. He took a sip of the tea he had been stirring in his hand. He was drinking tea in real life, too.</p>
<p>“There are two reasons.”</p>
<p>“Two?”</p>
<p>“You’re the only Lifer who can resolve or interfere in this matter, and you will be affected by this intervention.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung frowns.</p>
<p>They are speaking without his battlesuit, so his expression shows.</p>
<p>“Borteth has a lot of ambition. As one of the three Life Mission supervisors, he wants to surpass Gabenu and me in getting the top results.”</p>
<p>A moderate amount of ambition can become a source of power. Not having that amount of ambition means that the person does not want it enough.</p>
<p>But it is severe in Borteth’s case. It goes beyond ambition to greed.</p>
<p>“The process doesn’t matter as long as the results are good, so Borteth does annoying things and he always get some kind of result. Even if he fails, so he doesn’t feel discouraged. It seems that’s why he won’t leave it alone. He’s breaking all of our promises too.”</p>
<p>If entrepreneurs who want to become rich commit crimes in order to succeed, most will come under judgment of the law.</p>
<p>It isn’t right to compare with Life Mission, but a collision is inevitable if everyone is going on a righteous path and only one person tries to stray from that.</p>
<p>If that collision becomes an emotional fight, it could ruin everything.</p>
<p>“It isn’t good to ignore the processes. I’m not talking about rules or promises. Those are important, but there is something else that is truly important.”</p>
<p>“Are you referring to order?”</p>
<p>It is a part that Cha Jun Sung doesn’t understand as he listens.</p>
<p>“It’s similar. According to the way you put it, everything has an order. But what do you think will happen if we ignore that order? The warped order might be visible in the beginning, but it becomes harder and harder to keep track of as it becomes more entangled.”</p>
<p>There are things that the three supervisors need to consult each other on while proceeding, but Borteth is acting alone.</p>
<p>“One of those independent actions was the Heavy Gravity in North America.”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“We gained a lot of data from that battle between you and the level 8-s then. The result is good, isn’t it? What do you think happened to Borteth after that?”</p>
<p>“Punishment…”</p>
<p>“He did receive punishment even if it wasn’t very drastic. The problem started from there.”</p>
<p>Borteth had already shown severe opposition, but getting punished by Jigneon after getting clear results made him revolt.</p>
<p>On top of that, he formed bad feelings toward Cha Jun Sung, who is the source of his punishment. Cha Jun Sung had become a subject for him to vent on.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was speechless in disbelief.</p>
<p>“I’ll refer to them as investors to make it easier for you to understand. Those investors are looking kindly on Borteth’s independent actions kindly as well. You understand why, right?”</p>
<p>It’s because the results are good.</p>
<p>Jigneon gave him punishment but it was released quickly. There’s a reason why he acts on his own ridiculously even when he is being threatened.</p>
<p>No matter how much they don’t like it, Borteth is one of the three people who created Life Mission. He is a major shareholder with 33.3% of shares.</p>
<p>“You understand that you’ll be disadvantaged, right? If we leave him alone now, he’s sure to take his anger out on you.”</p>
<p>“What a crazy bastard.”</p>
<p>He’ll always have to be on guard, but it’ll be really dangerous if Borteth interferes while he is fighting a level 8 like last time. He doesn’t want to make a supervisor into the enemy.</p>
<p>If helpers are the messengers of god in Life Mission, the supervisors are those gods. The future is clear if the creature makes the creator into the enemy.</p>
<p>“Did you secretly bring me here to help me?”</p>
<p>Jigneon had matched Cha Jun Sung’s return time on purpose.</p>
<p>It would have been too obvious if he got summoned from reality, so he used the point when the gate opened.</p>
<p>“Borteth chose a Lifer to act on his behalf. He means to act from the shadows rather than showing himself on the forefront. This means that if something goes wrong, he’ll be able to cut it off from the tail. This will make it more frustrating, so what will you do? I have to choose one too. You.”</p>
<p>There is a saying that a shrimp’s back bursts in a fight between whales.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung felt strange because it was as though a mere human was being placed in the middle of a fight between gods.</p>
<p>“Is the Lifer Borteth chose a Ranker?”</p>
<p>“I heard he is a Ranker.”</p>
<p>“World Federation? Bloody Kingdom?”</p>
<p>“Which do you think?”</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like he would be from World Federation. All of the Lifers there are honest. A few have strange personalities, but none would be willing to do whatever Borteth told them to do as if they were machines.</p>
<p>“The latter.”</p>
<p>“Right. Will you be able to figure out who it is?”</p>
<p>“Blood King? Dark Side?”</p>
<p>There aren’t many in Bloody Kingdom who are both skilled and smart. The two he just mentioned are the best.</p>
<p>“Neither. Borteth needs an avatar that’ll do what he wants on his behalf. Those two are smart. They would probably just pretend to obey Borteth and calculate their options instead.”</p>
<p>“Then?”</p>
<p>“It’s no fun if I tell you. I have a video to show you. Once I show you this and tell you what I need to say, our conversation will be over.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 231</p>
<p>Jigneon flicks his finger.</p>
<p>A hologram appears in the air, showing a mission area.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Thousands of Lifers are engaged in a vicious melee against mutants.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung saw this and remembered fighting in the ocean. The battles are the same, the only difference being land and sea.</p>
<p>“What mark is that?”</p>
<p>A familiar guild mark. It is on the tip of his tongue, but he cannot recall it. He said that it would be Bloody Kingdom, but that isn’t the mark of Bloody Kingdom.</p>
<p>“It’s a level A mission.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Was Bloody Kingdom big enough to go into level A? Something that even the World Federation has been putting off? Are they pushing through with volume?</p>
<p>It’s level 8 if it’s a level A.</p>
<p>The World Federation could technically go into a level A. If all of the Rankers go up against level 8-s, they would be able to complete the mission at the cost of great damage. They haven’t attempted it yet because they want to complete it without making sacrifices.</p>
<p>“That’s the Lifer Borteth chose. He gave him benefits under the table.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A giant explosion occurs far from the Lifer and mutant battlefield. It is like the power of a missile falling.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Even after the giant explosion faded, there were continuous explosions. The point of view changes.</p>
<p>A Lifer is fighting against a large mutant.</p>
<p>“Scorpion? Ugh! I think I can remember what that is! What was that called?”</p>
<p>“Rogue Scorpion Monarch.”</p>
<p>“Oh right!”</p>
<p>A giant scorpion with an equal mix of black and white, brings down four pairs of pincers and three poisoned tails in order to crush the enemy.</p>
<p>Black fog floats near the scorpion in a 30 to 40 meter radius. It is an extremely poisonous fog that burns skin just from contact.</p>
<p>Level 8 Rogue Scorpion Monarch.</p>
<p>He is sure that it is the mutant that Poison King succeeded against in a one-person raid in order to enter the disaster ranking. Cha Jun Sung watches the Lifer fighting against the Rogue Scorpion Monarch. He will know who it is right away if he is a Ranker. Rankers have unique combat styles. It isn’t because they are strong, but because they have individuality.</p>
<p>“Tyrant!”</p>
<p>“Ha ha ha ha! Die!”</p>
<p>A hologram comes up in response to a harsh voice coming out of the battlesuit. It seems this is how the Lifer is being watched.</p>
<p>Tyrant is a terrorist.</p>
<p>He battles using bombs like Nuclear, who he is affiliated with. That is why the guild mark had been so familiar.</p>
<p>He is part of Bloody Kingdom, but he also runs a guild called Rage. This means he doesn’t have to go around with the guild members of Bloody Kingdom.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>A bomb in Tyrant’s hand becomes red. A red membrane was covering the bomb. A haze flickers around his hand.</p>
<p>“Red light bomb.”</p>
<p>9 combination battlesuit red light bomb. It isn’t a bomb that is sold in the store.</p>
<p>It is handmade by buying the materials. It is Tyrant’s unique skill to coagulate his own energy into a special bomb. It is similar yet distinct from similar terrorist Nuclear’s energy explosion with a pure energy ball.</p>
<p>It is a skill that can be used if it is combined with a level B battlesuit.</p>
<p>It isn’t fascinating, but its power bothers Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>The red light bomb left Tyrant’s hand and every time it exploded, the Rogue Scorpion Monarch’s fog trembles.</p>
<p>It is one against one.</p>
<p>To be able to battle one-on-one against a level 8.</p>
<p>“Did he reach completion?”</p>
<p>“Tyrant is on the exact path that you are on.”</p>
<p>Jigneon said it in a roundabout way, but Cha Jun Sung understood him.</p>
<p>There is one way of reaching completion without going through advancement. If Borteth had given Tyrant the choice of following him for benefits.</p>
<p>“… Did he give Tyrant an opening card? Why to someone like him?”</p>
<p>Nod.</p>
<p>“Because there’s no better tool. Think about it. He’ll be easy to control because he’s greedy and selfish. More so than Blood King or Dark Side.”</p>
<p>He agrees with what Jigneon is saying.</p>
<p>It isn’t that Tyrant isn’t smart. He’s the type who is willing to give mutual help if he can get what he wants.</p>
<p>When limited to the two-dimensional world of Life Mission, which isn’t touched by modern earth’s power, then he is someone who can do whatever it takes.</p>
<p>“It’s strange. Forget the card. How did he do his body modifications? What about the side effects? It isn’t something that can be done easily.”</p>
<p>Did he withstand the side effects?</p>
<p>Even the World Federation Rankers had been stuck at stages 7 and 8 before he helped them. It is normal to hesitate more when it comes to stages 9 and 10.</p>
<p>“We created Life Mission. The items and body modifications – all of it. The supervisors know how to weaken the side effects that come with body modifications. There is a different way for each person. Borteth used that on Tyrant. That’s how that guy got through stage 10. The only difference between you and him is the 1 combination battlesuit.”</p>
<p>Jigneon didn’t mention Cha Jun Sung’s mutation.</p>
<p>He is only comparing them as humans, with what can be seen to the naked eye.</p>
<p>“I told you before, didn’t I? You’re my challenger. I can’t leave them to be so reckless. This experiment needs to flow naturally. The only subjects are Lifers and mutants. Anything beyond is unnecessary.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung could get a glimpse of Jigneon’s personality. He is an old-fashioned type who is stubborn and places a lot of importance in principle.</p>
<p>Those who aren’t would see this is as frustrating, but he doesn’t seem to be a bad person.</p>
<p>‘Though I can’t tell what you’re really like.’</p>
<p>He didn’t show it on the outside.</p>
<p>Rather than respond to Jigneon, Cha Jun Sung watched Tyrant fight against the Rogue Scorpion Monarch.</p>
<p>He is strong. He has found his strength from the virtual version.</p>
<p>From the way he is switching items, it seems he scraped together everything he needed with his ample points as a foundation.</p>
<p>If he fights as Jigneon’s pawn, he can win.</p>
<p>He can win narrowly. The difference in Ranker strength is like a sheet of paper.</p>
<p>Even with 10 combinations, it is difficult to take on two Rankers at the same time.</p>
<p>It is a win if if is one-on-one, but a loss if it is two-on-one.</p>
<p>If fighting strength has to be calculated, Cha Jun Sung is 1.5 and 1 is a Ranker. That difference becomes distinguished amongst Rankers, but this is the average.</p>
<p>“You said that I’m a pawn. Why do I need to fight with Tyrant?”</p>
<p>They were enemies in the virtual version, but they have not come across each other in the reality version. There’s no need to bring up old feelings for no reason.</p>
<p>“Are you confident you can be free from Borteth? We may not like what he’s doing, but he’s a supervisor. Level S Lifer? That’s nothing compared to a supervisor.”</p>
<p>For the conversation to go like this, something has gone seriously wrong.</p>
<p>“So your point is that you’ll watch my back from Borteth.”</p>
<p>“I can’t give you the benefits that Borteth gave to Tyrant. That goes against the purpose of Life Mission. However, I can protect you from Borteth. That doesn’t go against the rules.”</p>
<p>‘A threat…”</p>
<p>Honestly, Cha Jun Sung is suspicious as to whether he really will be threatened and if what Jigneon is saying is the truth. He doesn’t want to become a pawn.</p>
<p>But it also doesn’t seem right to ignore all of this.</p>
<p>He might go completely berserk if there is another incidence like Heavy Gravity.</p>
<p>‘Let’s say I accept. How do we kill Tyrant? If he has the same tendencies he did in the virtual version, he’ll always have a string of subordinates with him.’</p>
<p>The World Federation will accept if he asks them for help. The two powers are enemies. There are a lot of people who have an axe to grind against Bloody Kingdom.</p>
<p>But it isn’t something he can bring up to them easily.</p>
<p>It’s related to survival. He doesn’t want to bring Park Jin Hyuk’s group into it either. He completely took them off the list.</p>
<p>Should he just hit and retreat by himself?</p>
<p>This is the most comfortable method, but he wants to take care of the situation without revealing his identity. He is desperate for a sparking idea.</p>
<p>“Are you considering what will happen when you accept or reject in your mind?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>He didn’t deny it.</p>
<p>As important as this is, he needs to be that much more cautious.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 232</p>
<p>“You don’t need to act as a Lifer. Become the subject of the mission. You could become the subject. You wouldn’t be a human at that moment.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung blinked.</p>
<p>If he understood correctly, this means he would take on the role of a mutant being hunted by Lifers.</p>
<p>‘My identity won’t be revealed if I kill Tyrant in my mutant form.’</p>
<p>There are more pros than cons no matter how he thinks about it, but there is a fatal problem here. The operation is a failure if he can’t figure this out.</p>
<p>“Will that be possible when Borteth knows my mutant form?”</p>
<p>“Only us three supervisors know about this. The general manager used his authority to put a gag order. But the probability that Borteth follows this is low, since going against the rules is his specialty. That’s why I’ll keep Borteth marked while you do it. It’ll be about a couple months.”</p>
<p>As long as the supervisors don’t get involved, the restrictions on Cha Jun Sung’s actions disappear.</p>
<p>It becomes an environment in which he can focus on Tyrant.</p>
<p>“Is ‘Tyrant’s death’ all you’re asking for? There’s nothing more, right?”</p>
<p>“Borteth is abusing his authority as a supervisor. If Tyrant dies, he not only won’t have the power to reinvest, but he can’t use another card so he won’t be able to act so freely. It won’t be easy. You know that, right?”</p>
<p>He knows well.</p>
<p>Jigneon wants Tyrant’s death.</p>
<p>In other words, results.</p>
<p>He needs to fight Lifers who came in with him as well. If the situation worsens, he might need to face Bloody Kingdom Rankers.</p>
<p>‘That means I can’t get help.’</p>
<p>His mutation is a secret he can’t tell anyone. If he fights as a mutant, he can’t get help from his friends. He needs to resolve it himself.</p>
<p>‘Will I be able to control the mutant?’</p>
<p>The superior mutant exercises strong dominance over the inferior mutant. Instilling absolute fear allows a king to reign. Strength is everything with the law of the jungle.</p>
<p>If Cha Jun Sung is able to control mutants in the vicinity with his level 8 dominion, it would be of great help.</p>
<p>‘Funny.’</p>
<p>To be considering it after getting dragged here against his will, he can’t get the drift of whether he should understand or not.</p>
<p>“It’ll become extremely bothersome once Borteth decides to disadvantage you in earnest. You need to cut out his pawn before that happens. I’ll keep his eyes and ears covered for the time being. You have nothing to worry about.”</p>
<p>Jigneon is saying that he will take care of the troublesome aspects so that he can handle the general mission.</p>
<p>“I’ll just ask one thing. If this ends in success, will Borteth find out that I acted as your pawn?”</p>
<p>“He’ll probably find out once his eyes and ears become uncovered, but didn’t I tell you? I’ll watch your back so that he won’t be able to try again.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung interpreted Jigneon’s tone, even though he pretended not to.</p>
<p>He didn’t speak definitively. He twisted the end subtly. It means that he’ll do his best, but he might not become a perfect defense.</p>
<p>‘It looks like I’ll be promoted from a subject to vent on to an enemy if this is a success.’</p>
<p>His friends’ knowledge is too limited for him to discuss with them.</p>
<p>There are too many secrets.</p>
<p>He’ll need to consult with Odin.</p>
<p>Odin could be on Jigneon’s side, but he can just consult with him since he is leaning towards accepting.</p>
<p>“I want to go home. I’ll contact you within a few days, so let me go.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>Jigneon flicked his fingers once more.</p>
<p>Then a return gate appeared next to Cha Jun Sung. It was like a switch.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung lightly greeted Jigneon and went inside.</p>
<p>“I’m neutral.”</p>
<p>Since he can’t show how he really feels, the ways to show his sincerity are very limited. All he can do is hope that the other person believes him.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung returned home, took a refreshing shower, and slept deeply.</p>
<p>He doesn’t feel mental or physical fatigue with his superhuman mind and body.</p>
<p>It is out of habit.</p>
<p>He has become a mutant, but his habits linger.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung rested for a day, and then called Odin. Jigneon must have reactivated the system he blocked the day before, because a response came right away.</p>
<p>[The three supervisors have very distinct personalities. Jigneon is a monotypical scientist as you said. Borteth is… Gabenu is playful.]</p>
<p>Odin didn’t mention Borteth. Cha Jun Sung doesn’t need him to tell him.</p>
<p>“Anyway, what you’re saying is that he isn’t one to stab me in the back.”</p>
<p>[To Jigneon, you’re the Lifer who has the highest chance of showing him the end of Life Mission. And that’s accomplishing it with your own strength. There’s no reason for him to use you in a negative direction.]</p>
<p>“Is he that trustworthy?”</p>
<p>[Jigneon and Gabenu don’t mistreat helpers. They acknowledge that we have unique privileges and treat us as beings of value.]</p>
<p>Jigneon must be trustworthy from the way Odin is talking about him.</p>
<p>It was a choice between accepting and rejecting. Since he’s made up his mind, he’ll do it properly.</p>
<p>[Acceptance delivered. Mission adjustment following acceptance complete. You will be able to check the mission description once you choose a departure date. Lifers will be able to see after the mission has been settled.]</p>
<p>“Departure… Will it take another couple months?”</p>
<p>[Time is a flexible factor. It is difficult to say what the duration will be. That isn’t something I can control.]</p>
<p>“Then I’ll just rest for a week before I go. I feel bad going right away.”</p>
<p>They took care of a big case, so Park Jin Hyuk’s group won’t be going into any missions for the time being.</p>
<p>He’ll hang out with them for a bit and slip away.</p>
<p>[Would you like to see the primary missions that have been configured for a week later? There can be slight subsequent fluctuations.]</p>
<p>“Huh? Yeah.”</p>
<p>[Level Advancement Mission: Black Devil]</p>
<p>– Goal: Attainment</p>
<p>– Description: Unknown. A Black Devil about which nothing, from where it came from to how it formed, has claimed the western region of North America as its territory. Evil Queen and her 4 daughters have gone missing and other level 8-s are hiding all their traces. The Black Devil’s appearance is the medium for a new war cloud hovering over North America. Find the existence of the Black Devil wandering somewhere in the west, and restore North America to the hand of mutants!</p>
<p>– Reward: 8,000,000,000 points. Lucky box.</p>
<p>“Am I the Black Devil?”</p>
<p>[It is an appropriate title for you. Don’t you like it? We adapted the name from Asia’s Black Demon because you are similar.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung flinched momentarily. How would the supervisors react if they found out that Black Demon and he were the same people?</p>
<p>Potential level 9. Two Black Demons. They won’t know if he doesn’t tell them.</p>
<p>“It makes me cringe.”</p>
<p>The introduction itself wasn’t that special, but the description made him cringe. 8,000,000,000 designed reward points. It is advancement. It is a bit burdensome.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung alone cannot handle advancement abilities.</p>
<p>Jigneon measured it like this because he is a Lifer.</p>
<p>Knowing the enemy and the self always results in wins. Cha Jun Sung knows about Lifers in detail. This is because there is variety in the number of cases.</p>
<p>“There aren’t many advancements. I don’t see the Vanessa mission. Didn’t she survive?”</p>
<p>[She is dead.]</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>[I don’t know either. The supervisors will know.]</p>
<p>She had been injured, but not enough to die. It seems like something is there, but he halted his curiosity.</p>
<p>He doesn’t care whether Vanessa is dead or alive.</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s because Vanessa is dead, but there are four advancements. Does that mean there are only four opportunities to advance if you can’t find a hidden advancement like with Deep Sea Teeth?”</p>
<p>It is 5 including Cha Jun Sung’s Black Devil.</p>
<p>All of them except 1 are for 8 billion points. The mission with the most points is for 15 billion.</p>
<p>It has to be high. It is related to the cocoon from Africa.</p>
<p>“What will it feel like to become the subject of a mission?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung used to kill mutants, and now the situation has reversed so that he needs to kill Lifers.</p>
<p>He won’t say that he won’t kill freely. He will do what he sets out to do. Tyrant doesn’t have remorse or a conscience.</p>
<p>“Black Devil. Black Devil? It sticks. I’ll become a Devil. I’ll figure out my abilities for certain as a mutant not a Lifer.”</p>
<p>He’ll fly as a mutant this time. He will become the winner.</p>
<p>“Your mission is a fail. The score is annihilation.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 233</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took a short break in reality, and then entered the mission. He told Park Jin Hyuk’s group that he was doing some traveling for vacation.</p>
<p>They didn’t show any unexpected behavior like offering to go along.</p>
<p>They seemed to want to spend some time relaxing because the long mission they had just gone through had taken a toll.</p>
<p>[One of the helpers will act as you, Cha Jun Sung, in reality.]</p>
<p>Communication isn’t possible in different dimensions.</p>
<p>Many problems can arise while Cha Jun Sung stays in a mission as the Black Devil.</p>
<p>It is strange for someone who said they were going on vacation to be living inside of a mission.</p>
<p>That is why they prepared a replacement to act like Cha Jun Sung and keep in continuous contact with Park Jin Hyuk’s group. This is so that he can focus on just the mission.</p>
<p>“Feels empty.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks down at his body.</p>
<p>The battlesuit that had always been there is gone. All he has are his casual clothes, which don’t fit in with the mission.</p>
<p>He put his combat equipment in the space compression bag, and left it in reality. He has come in with his bare body.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung gained several privileges through Black Devil.</p>
<p>First, he can summon the space compression bag that he left in reality at any time. If he inputs his locations, it will come flying to him like the mail.</p>
<p>Second, Jigneon made his PDA small. There is a difference in what it can do compared to the watch type, but he can use it as an earpiece. There is no problem for him to stay in contact with Odin even in mutant form. He hears Odin’s voice in his ear instead of from his wrist.</p>
<p>Third, all of the lives he kills are converted into points. Mutants are a given, but even Lifers are counted according to their level. These are distinct from PK points. He can get points for killing, and he can also take the points that they had accumulated. The method of calculation is different.</p>
<p>Fourth, the 8 billion reward points for the Black Devil mission. This goes to Cha Jun Sung if he kills Tyrant. Each level S item is worth billions of points. Cha Jun Sung invested all of the points he got from Deep Sea Teeth to improve his specifications.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, he was even able to get switching gear but it is impossible to cover the disposable items.</p>
<p>He’ll be able to cover the points that go out from disposable items if he completes Black Devil. He can gain a lot of points if he does well.</p>
<p>“You said this is Canada, right? Why did you choose North America as the mission area?”</p>
<p>[It might be just the virtual version, but Lifer Cha Jun Sung spent 10 years in North America. You’re more used to it than the other five continents.]</p>
<p>He is thoroughly satisfied.</p>
<p>There is no place that is more familiar to him, though there are many more places that he has not been to than he has been to because it is so big.</p>
<p>“Do you really think Tyrant will come in? We don’t know when he’ll enter and we don’t know for sure whether he’ll even come or not. Don’t you think we’ll get old and die while waiting for him?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung asked Odin how he knows that Tyrant will enter the Black Devil mission.</p>
<p>This is how Odin responded:</p>
<p>[Tyrant is suffering from insufficient points ever since he became complete.]</p>
<p>[That is why he hunted the Rogue Scorpion Monarch. Even if he is the master of a large guild, he won’t be able to satisfy his ambition once he has opened the level S store. He’s always been extremely ambitious, but it exploded since he surpassed the starting point.]</p>
<p>[What would be the way to gather the points he lacks and to open the level S store? It is advancement. According to an analysis of Tyrant’s actions, the probability that he will try it within a month is over 90%.]</p>
<p>“What about the other 10%?”</p>
<p>[Within two months.]</p>
<p>“Let’s say that’s all true. What’s to say that Tyrant will enter my mission?”</p>
<p>There are 5 advancement missions.</p>
<p>The probability is 20%.</p>
<p>[There’s no need to cling to guarantees. Africa’s cocoon mission is 15 billion. Lifer Cha Jun Sung, would you try it?]</p>
<p>Try it?</p>
<p>Leave an 8 billion point mission to enter one that is worth 15 billion?</p>
<p>They need to be cautious with their first tries. It is stupid to bravely enter the one of the highest difficulty.</p>
<p>“Am I crazy?”</p>
<p>[Tyrant is the same.]</p>
<p>“Even without that, there are four. Then it’s 25%?”</p>
<p>[Where did Tyrant play in the virtual version?]</p>
<p>“South America… Oh! Thinking about it, he’ll be familiar with this place as well.”</p>
<p>Tyrant also conducted his missions in South America.</p>
<p>It is his hometown. The reward points are the same. It is inevitable that his eye will go to this mission more than ones in other continents.</p>
<p>[We didn’t mention North America in the mission description multiple times for no reason. There are additional devices that should make him feel like he should enter. We’re sure that Tyrant will choose this mission.]</p>
<p>Jigneon went somewhere with Borteth.</p>
<p>Borteth followed him because his scheme has already been set and has nothing to worry about. The remaining supervisor is Gabenu. He is filling Jigneon’s empty seat.</p>
<p>As the chief authority on Cha Jun Sung and Tyrant’s Black Devil mission, he is going to subtly twist it to another level A mission in the worst case scenario.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung and Tyrant are the only Lifers who are able to enter an advancement mission anyway, so no other Lifers will be disadvantaged even if this happens.</p>
<p>While talking to Odin for a time, he heard an uncomfortable sound in his ear.</p>
<p>Gatecrashers that have come following Cha Jun Sung’s odor.</p>
<p>“I’ll need to put matters related to him aside, and take care of everything in the vicinity.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s clothes ripped and his body shows. The Black Devil made its first appearance with an overwhelming aura.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>A summons gate appears and countless Lifers come out.</p>
<p>They look to be over a thousand. It’s a giant group of thousands.</p>
<p>A full core that used the whole level A mission entry limit – 100,000 people.</p>
<p>The Lifers who entered, acted quickly and in unison. They created dozens of round walls in order.</p>
<p>There was a single person standing in the middle of the deepest and smallest wall.</p>
<p>“Master. Nothing in particular seems strange.”</p>
<p>“It is the initial summons area. It’ll be safe, so break the boundaries, spread out, and look around. We need to know where we are before we go.”</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>Tyrant gave orders with his arms crossed and an arrogant expression on his face.</p>
<p>Then, members of the Rage guild split into groups of 100 to go investigate.</p>
<p>“He he! North America… This is an optimal advancement mission for me.”</p>
<p>He felt it as soon as he saw the description.</p>
<p>Black Devil mission, related to North America where his homeground had been in the virtual version. There was nothing more he would ask for.</p>
<p>‘We’ll get a feel for the difficulty level with this before completing the mission.’</p>
<p>An unknown existence. The mission that Borteth hoping for is of a concerning difficulty. Even if he completes Black Devil now, he doesn’t have any immediate thoughts.</p>
<p>He will make a move once he has considered this and that and decided that it isn’t a loss.</p>
<p>About 30 minutes passed.</p>
<p>The forces in guild Rage return one by one. They are in a small city in northern America.</p>
<p>Ring ring!</p>
<p>Tyrant’s electronic map opens and pinpoints the location his subordinates have given him.</p>
<p>It is a level A item.</p>
<p>He is the only one in the Rage guild with one.</p>
<p>“Should we go north or south.”</p>
<p>Tyrant considers the area south of the point on his electronic map. He can’t split the guild power of 10,000 people in half.</p>
<p>He has filled up the number of people he can bring in even with the abilities of a complete Lifer, just in case. He has gained the strength to fight against a level 8, but he doesn’t know what could happen.</p>
<p>Circumstances could change. He needed sacrifices that he could use as shields.</p>
<p>A very reliable 10,000 shields.</p>
<p>They will be quicker in finding it if they split up, but it becomes more dangerous.</p>
<p>He isn’t in a rush.</p>
<p>All he has to do is complete the mission even if it takes some time.</p>
<p>With this kind of power, they won’t get pushed back even if they come across a large group of mutants with level 8-s in it.</p>
<p>‘I can’t use my precious level S items. This is my life.’</p>
<p>Tyrant feels his space compression bag and smiles in satisfaction. The level S store is a treasure chest. The level A store is as well, but level S is another universe.</p>
<p>He has 20 Universe Eyes that all Rankers know and frequently used as equipment specialized in navigation, but he has no intention of using them.</p>
<p>He won’t do something so unnecessary when he has a mighty labor force in front of him.</p>
<p>‘I need to open level S no matter what. I can do it. I’ll crush everyone. I’ll go beyond Rage and take over Bloody Kingdom.’</p>
<p>Tyrant’s imagination stretched out in his mind. He’s confident that he could take on all of the Rankers in Bloody Kingdom right now, but it isn’t the right time.</p>
<p>He will make them surrender. He can’t have the proper influence if he kills all of them.</p>
<p>‘You too.’</p>
<p>Overload. Life Mission’s strongest. He can’t be taken down with a 9 combination explosive, but it doesn’t matter. All he has to do is break down this wall.</p>
<p>“Have you decided, Master?”</p>
<p>“We’re going north.”</p>
<p>The U.S. is Evil Queen’s territory.</p>
<p>No one except Cha Jun Sung has seen her, but there is fragmentary information. They need to be cautious of even 0.1% danger.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Rage guild members go back to a mode of transportation that is as big as several buses combined. Tyrant and the cadres board a tank.</p>
<p>This happens everywhere – chores like driving are left to the underlings.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 234</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung bent over and punched the face of a bizarre looking 3-4m mutant. It’s head split like a watermelon.</p>
<p>“Killed them all.”</p>
<p>His immediate area is a field of corpses.</p>
<p>There are crushed mutants missing limbs everywhere.</p>
<p>He did this within minutes.</p>
<p>Kik!</p>
<p>A faint sound.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s finger flicks out and tosses through the debris.</p>
<p>A scream coming from the throes of death. One of them must be alive.</p>
<p>“Phew. How much longer do I have to wait for them to find me? It would be easier if I could go to them.”</p>
<p>[I cannot tell you their location.]</p>
<p>“I know.”</p>
<p>Tyrant entered the mission.</p>
<p>That was already several weeks ago. He doesn’t know what he’s doing and where. He knows nothing other than that he had entered.</p>
<p>If he had known where Tyrant was, he would have gone and spied on him at the least.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung has nothing to do right now, so he is hunting mutants. He means to accumulate points while Tyrant makes his way here.</p>
<p>“It isn’t easy finding useful ones.”</p>
<p>He needs a lot of mutants if he is to take on Tyrant and the Rage guild. With his personality, he is likely to have come in with a full core.</p>
<p>10,000 levels B and C Lifers.</p>
<p>That is a powerful group even without Tyrant.</p>
<p>He needs to head off the number of heads. He is looking for a useful mutant species that live in groups, but they don’t really catch his eye.</p>
<p>At the least, he wants level 5 mutants that live in groups of tens of thousands, but he has only seen useless ones until now.</p>
<p>There hasn’t been progress for weeks.</p>
<p>He would want nothing more if there were things like the parasites from the Path of Blood, but it seems he had been lucky them.</p>
<p>“A single mutant is entirely useless if it isn’t level 7.”</p>
<p>Mutants, like humans, have individual characteristics.</p>
<p>There are different personalities within species as well. So what would happen if the species were different?</p>
<p>There will be problems if they are gathered into one area, even if they are managed well.</p>
<p>Level 7 is worth managing regardless of species when considering strength. There won’t be many of them anyway, so it’ll be a small group of elites.</p>
<p>It is an impossible goal because it’s hard to even find one.</p>
<p>This is why Cha Jun Sung wants mutants that live in groups.</p>
<p>If he just takes out the head, the underlings will follow him naturally.</p>
<p>The suppression process is bothersome, it isn’t impossible.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung reduced his 10m body into a fourth of the size. He only maintained his body during battle. Otherwise, he limited his consumption of energy.</p>
<p>He doesn’t transform into human form.</p>
<p>He will maintain this form until this is all over. He cannot forget.</p>
<p>His role in Black Devil is the mutant.</p>
<p>Is it because he has gotten used to the battlesuit?</p>
<p>There’s a strange sense of awareness when he is in this state. He intends to get rid of that feeling.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is in mutant form, but he cannot lose his human habits. He only sleeps on the street and eats raw meat when he has to. Normally, he acted like an ordinary human.</p>
<p>He maintained his living habits. He is only externally a monster.</p>
<p>Less than an hour of sleep over several days is plenty, so he took care of that in derelict buildings or hotels. And Odin procured food for him.</p>
<p>Since Cha Jun Sung entered the mission, all he’s done is eat, sleep, and play.</p>
<p>“This won’t do.”</p>
<p>For the past few days, he stopped hunting and locked himself in a residence to come up with a plan.</p>
<p>The plan isn’t very special. Power enhancement is priority. He needs to find good fighters to take on the Rage guild members.</p>
<p>He went searching through everything in Path of Blood without complaint because he was looking for Odelia, but it isn’t his duty right now.</p>
<p>He wandered around the area he had been initially summoned to, barely searching for them. There can only be a minimal number of mutants since the area he is working in is small.</p>
<p>“Get me my space compression bag.”</p>
<p>[You’ve decided to use it.]</p>
<p>“What else can I do? I don’t want to go searching around.”</p>
<p>Good fighters. If he knows where mutants are gathered, he can just go looking for them. But he has to search through everything because he doesn’t.</p>
<p>His stance changed. He tried to save his points before entering, but that resolve came crashing down once he entered.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Odin connects the dimensions.</p>
<p>A summons gate opened in front of Cha Jun Sung and a small bag, his space compression bag, came out.</p>
<p>It has been filled with better items than what was in the one that he lost.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took his space compression bag and went to the top of the highest buildings where he was staying. Then he took out a few Universe Eyes.</p>
<p>“Let’s use one first.”</p>
<p>A Universe Eye became activated and shot into the sky. It ejected the hundred eyes and the search range immediately expanded to a 100km radius.</p>
<p>“I’ll send two more out. Give me any two coordinates that overlap.”</p>
<p>[355. 253. Southeast. 620. 962. Northeast. If they are installed according to this Universe Eye, this will have the best effect.]</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>2 Universe Eyes fly to the locations Odin listed.</p>
<p>This method of installation was called the ‘sandwich’ in the virtual version.</p>
<p>The Universe Eyes will be installed if it is within the search range without having to go himself.</p>
<p>It is inefficient however. The search ranges overlap and cover areas that don’t need to be included. It isn’t a method used unless in special circumstances.</p>
<p>[2 hours estimated for installation at this flight speed. Will you search the area that has been installed first?]</p>
<p>“It’s fine. I’ll just do it all at once.”</p>
<p>His normal PDA is inside the space compression bag. He can look at the hologram with that. There’s no reason to look at it two or three times. He’ll look at them all together.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>[As you can see, there are three mutant groups that meet the search conditions. The Thirask herd, Poison herd, and Bomb Ant herd.]</p>
<p>They only found three mutant herds that live in groups even though he sent out 3 Universe Eyes.</p>
<p>The Thirask is a low level 5 lizard that is a half size larger than an elephant. Its main attacks are through its poisonous teeth and tail. There are about 3000 to 4000 of them living near the river.</p>
<p>The Poison herd are poisonous butterflies. Middle level 5. They took control of a city and are stuck all over the buildings. They number about half of that of the Thirask. They possess several types of poison and are a flying species, so they are weak against the strong and strong against the weak. One of them can kill hundreds.</p>
<p>Lastly, unlike the previously discovered two mutant groups, the Bomb Ant are low level 4 red and black ants that are as large as humans.</p>
<p>Like its name ‘Bomb,’ Bomb Ants are a suicide team that specialize in self-destruction.</p>
<p>Its explosive power is similar to that of a grenade. That power cannot destroy a basic type battlesuit, but their strength is volume.</p>
<p>If water drops keep falling, they can penetrate a rock. Nothing could be worse than having dozens of them swarm in everywhere.</p>
<p>They live deep in a cave, and it is impossible to figure out how many of them there are.</p>
<p>They live in a place that makes it hard for the Universe Eye or the hundred eyes.</p>
<p>“Take the Thirask out. I don’t like it because it’s gross.”</p>
<p>He is joking.</p>
<p>The Thirask can’t fight properly if there is no water. If their supply of water is cut off for a long time, they will dry up and die. There are a lot of restrictions.</p>
<p>The Poison herd is a no-go as well. There are too few of them. If they go into aerial battle with thousands of battlesuit Lifers, they’ll be overwhelmed as soon as they strike. The efficacy of poison that only works against living things falls to the characteristics of mechanical armor. Only acid poison powder would work, but that won’t do the job.</p>
<p>“Let’s go with the Bomb Ants.”</p>
<p>They are low level and he doesn’t know how many of them there are, but ants tend to be high in numbers. In severe cases, hundreds of thousands of them live together.</p>
<p>Even in the virtual version, he’s never heard of Bomb Ants living in numbers of hundreds or thousands. Their main attack is only suicide, but that depends on how they’re used.</p>
<p>[We have seen level 5 and 6 mutants in original form near the Bomb Ant hill, using them as a source of food.]</p>
<p>“Are they allies?”</p>
<p>They could have created a tacit alliance in order to prevent the expansion of the Bomb Ants’ power. They are managing the balance so that it does not come crashing down.</p>
<p>“The distance?”</p>
<p>[Coordinates 725.522. They are 170 km northeast.]</p>
<p>“It’s far.”</p>
<p>Wings form on Cha Jun Sung’s back. They aren’t that difficult to control, but he has gotten better at it. It is slow, but he is able to fly. It’ll be better for him to fly there and get a chance to practice.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 235</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung arrived at his destination and folded his wings.</p>
<p>He plummeted hundreds of meters to the ground, the ground cracked and a crater formed. It was an impactful entrance.</p>
<p>He is on a large mountain between several small cities.</p>
<p>The mountain is surrounded by the small cities, so it is a location in which it is naturally easy to get surrounded.</p>
<p>Is this why he was being watched by the mutants?</p>
<p>“I’m here.”</p>
<p>A level 8 roar that could not be the result of a living organism’s vocal chords, resounding like several loud speakers combined, swept through the cities and mountain.</p>
<p>Mutants experienced a phenomenon of mental decay and stopped what they were doing, trembling in fear.</p>
<p>There are no level 7-s nearby. The strongest mutant is level 6.</p>
<p>An unimaginable gap.</p>
<p>They all looked up.</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants detected the arrival of a top predator and dug deep into their caves, hiding without any movement.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s body grows smaller.</p>
<p>He became the size of his body when he is a human. He is going to go into the ant hill.</p>
<p>He can’t go in with his normal form because the hole is small.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung roared again. He did it inside the ant hill this time, so the effect was amplified and spread to all corners.</p>
<p>The terrain is complicated.</p>
<p>The scale of the cave is impressive. There must be hundreds or even thousands of rooms. It is fitting for the habits of ants.</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung went around the ant hill freely, the Bomb Ants began to weakly express their hostility. They seem like they might attack at any moment.</p>
<p>“Queen, Queen Bomb Ant.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung passes food warehouses and hatcheries where they breed disgusting larva and newborn Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>The places are repeated, so he is getting confused as to whether he has already been somewhere or not. He didn’t care however, because it was fairly interesting.</p>
<p>He kept searching, and half a day passed after he entered the cave. There are still a lot of places he needs to look, but he is getting used to it.</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>He didn’t have a chance to even react. A Bomb Ant approached him on the wall, stuck to Cha Jun Sung’s back, and exploded. The gunpowder is different. It is smoky and smells bloody. The smell of ammonia is accompanied by a shockwave, and a sharply fragmented hard shell and bones fly as debris.</p>
<p>That was the beginning.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>One time is hard, two is easy. The Bomb Ants saw their comrade’s intense self-destruction, and jumped in one after the other. It was just like bombing.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung inflated his coat thickly in the midst of the exploding ant hill. The Bomb Ants’ explosive power is pounding on his entire body.</p>
<p>‘Pretty good.’</p>
<p>There was no big hit. But there is a reaction from his coat when this is repeated hundreds of times.</p>
<p>Each Bomb Ant’s ability is barely middle level 3. Their self-destruction and distinctive characteristic of swarming together makes them level 4.</p>
<p>“They block it desperately. Always making it so obvious.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t get overwhelmed by the explosions, and went forward. If they need to fight, even lower levels will attack an upper level. The Queen must be nearby. He is sure that they are sacrificing themselves and self-destructing in order to protect their precious Queen.</p>
<p>“I can’t… see.”</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s tail goes up like a snake. Then it became sharp like a needle and penetrated the Bomb Ants jumping at him.</p>
<p>They became skewered on the tail.</p>
<p>His tail went back down and Bomb Ants littered the floor.</p>
<p>Immediate death without the chance for them to explode. He killed a fair number, but that many more showed up.</p>
<p>The hole in the cave grows larger.</p>
<p>As that happens, the attacks lessen.</p>
<p>How much have they dug in?</p>
<p>A public space as large as a gym appears. At the center, there is the Queen Bomb Ant the size of a house, with dozens of level 5 Bomb Ants. They are all looking at the same thing. Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>“It feels like I’m facing a few apartment buildings.”</p>
<p>The public space must be connected to every path in the cave, because there are hundreds of holes. Bomb Ants pour out of them.</p>
<p>“Follow me. You’ll have to take a big sacrifice, but I’ll help you revive your tribe. You could take over this entire area.”</p>
<p>He is speaking in human language, but he didn’t attempt a conversation. They will know by instinct why he has come into the ant hull.</p>
<p>The Queen makes a movement toward Cha Jun Sung. It translates to, ‘Everyone attack.’</p>
<p>Thousands of Bomb Ants jump out of the holes in the wall. They overlap with each other, making it look like a wave.</p>
<p>“The Queen lays the eggs, right?”</p>
<p>He doesn’t know whether she is a hermaphrodite or if she mates.</p>
<p>He will kill everything that comes at him.</p>
<p>He’ll let the Queen and the few level 5-s live.</p>
<p>Bomb Ants have a high reproduction rate and speed, so one can become a hundred within a day as long as there are no obstacles in the vicinity.</p>
<p>If they confirm his strength with their eyes rather than their instinct, they will know. There’s no need for him to make the effort to explain.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>The battle ended in less than an hour. Of course, Cha Jun Sung is the winner.</p>
<p>The Queen didn’t declare her surrender until Bombs Ants were no longer jumping out of the walls and the only troops she had were in the public space.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had counted the Bombs Ants while he was fighting them. Actually, Odin did it for him.</p>
<p>Since it was through artificial intelligence, it calculated the number of Bomb Ants that Cha Jun Sung killed with a margin of error at a little over 10,000.</p>
<p>This is less than they had expected, but this is understandable when considering the other mutants surrounding the mountain that keep the Bomb Ants in check.</p>
<p>As the Bomb Ants are living organisms, they need to eat in order to survive. They need to go out and hunt regardless of the knowledge that the environment is disadvantageous to them.</p>
<p>The mutants maintained balance by killing the Bomb Ants that come out to hunt. That is why the Bomb Ants kept dying and being born. The cycle of the ecosystem made it impossible for them to expand their power.</p>
<p>“Odin. Where’s the closest city?”</p>
<p>[There is a small city 4km west of this place.]</p>
<p>He is going to flip a nearby city and provide the Bomb Ants with food. Once their numbers increase, he will direct their attention elsewhere.</p>
<p>They need to take over nearby areas in order to take on Tyrant and the Rage guild.</p>
<p>“I’m a farmer! I need to lay the seeds if I want to harvest. Alright. Shall we go scatter the seeds?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung leaves the ant hill.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung arrives in a small city with an estimated population of 50,000 to 60,000. But that doesn’t mean that many mutants are living here.</p>
<p>He doesn’t know what the laws are.</p>
<p>Their law is disorder. They dislike area overlap since birth, so the land and population are inversely proportional.</p>
<p>There are just a couple thousand mutants living in the small city.</p>
<p>Of the cities near the mountain, this is considered one of the lower ranks.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung swept the outside first. He attacked the vital spots. He wrapped up dozens of the corpses with his tail and took them back to the ant hill.</p>
<p>He did this multiple times and delivered his simple message to the Queen. She understood because she has basic intellect as a level 6.</p>
<p>After that, hundreds of Bomb Ants followed Cha Jun Sung around.</p>
<p>Battles were left to Cha Jun Sung. The Bomb Ants watched and then moved the corpses back to the ant hill.</p>
<p>They are porters, not soldiers.</p>
<p>There was no damage and the acquirement of food went smoothly, so their numbers increased quickly. After a month, they recovered from the damage that Cha Jun Sung incurred.</p>
<p>The small cities that he used as hunting grounds became ghost towns where nothing was living, whether they be humans or mutants.</p>
<p>Nearby cities disappeared one by one.</p>
<p>As that happened, the Bomb Ants grew stronger.</p>
<p>When they swallowed the 4th city, their numbers exceeded 50,000.</p>
<p>“No more. We can’t go beyond this.”</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant speaks to Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung rejected her, saying he wants more mutants and he wants a stronger power.</p>
<p>A 50,000 head count is difficult even for mutants living in groups.</p>
<p>Checks start to come in if the number grows too high.</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant succeeded in populating the local area without much difficulty thanks to Cha Jun Sung. That is why their ambitions aligned.</p>
<p>She wanted to have a larger territory than she had now.</p>
<p>But Cha Jun Sung knows.</p>
<p>There is no end to greed. It is a definite that there is no end to giving aid.</p>
<p>‘The bigger problem is that she’s resisting my dominion.’</p>
<p>The Queen Bomb Ant was forgetting how she gained such power and was starting to get arrogant.</p>
<p>If she becomes more confident, she might rebel.</p>
<p>So he’s against helping them obtain more power.</p>
<p>Pressure from an upper level to a lower level, from a predator to prey for dominance isn’t like brainwashing. It is making them surrender by force.</p>
<p>[I’m stronger than you, so obey me. If you don’t, I’ll kill you.]</p>
<p>There is only one result if the prey surpasses or challenges the predator in dissatisfaction with its own strength or influence.</p>
<p>‘She’ll probably use the power she created with my help against me.’</p>
<p>No chance.</p>
<p>Why did he raise the Bomb Ants? He didn’t do it for someone else’s benefit. He did it for himself. He can’t leave the situation to lose control.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung ignored the Queen Bomb Ant.</p>
<p>He wanted to just kill her, but all of his efforts would become for nought.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung became dominant over Queen Bomb Ant with force, but Queen Bomb Ant was born a queen. She has the support of the Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>If their pillar dies, their social structure will be destroyed. That is why he can’t just kill her because he wants to.</p>
<p>‘Cunning bitch.’</p>
<p>She is watching his psychological state.</p>
<p>She is testing his patience and seeing how much she can go against him and how much he will forgive.</p>
<p>It has only been a month since they met, but the Queen Bomb Ant has developed. She is evolving little by little. The force she rules has gone from 10,000 to 50,000.</p>
<p>There has been mental growth in maintaining an expanding military force.</p>
<p>Odin said that the phenomenon seems to be that her mental capacity is growing as she gains responsibilities. It hasn’t been proven scientifically.</p>
<p>They do not know exactly how mutants evolve. But they do know one thing. A high level mutant develops as the number of mutants they dominate increases.</p>
<p>‘I’ll have to kill her once this is over.’</p>
<p>He wouldn’t have taken away everything they achieved if she had been decent, but she tests him too much. She’s one to stab him in the back.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 236</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Tens of thousands of Bomb Ants collided with mutants coming at them from the front.</p>
<p>There is a vibration from the strong explosions resulting from their self-destruction.</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants prevailed.</p>
<p>The Queen Bomb Ant is attacking a mid-size city with 30,000 Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>“Are you saying you’ll try it on your own?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is watching the Bomb Ants’ battle from a high place.</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant planned to expand her own power without Cha Jun Sung’s help.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t stop her. He knows that they will fail.</p>
<p>Mutants just pushed through in the beginning, but they later felt the Bomb Ants’ abilities and formed an alliance.</p>
<p>The only difference is whether there are a lot or few. There isn’t a difference from when they had been in the mountain. As the Bomb Ants wanted to become stronger and take over a larger territory, the mutants they need to fight became stronger as well.</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant brandished her sharp mouth and arms and legs, and showed the abilities of a top level 6. She had normally been just a high level 6.</p>
<p>Cutting, ripping, biting. Mutant fighting is cruel.</p>
<p>They become distinct from the fight with Lifers who attack with firearms, in that they are primitive.</p>
<p>Blood spurts.</p>
<p>It feels like he is looking at the Path of Blood that Odelia created. Blood and corpses are everywhere. Tens of thousands of mutants are in a melee in the middle of that.</p>
<p>“How fun.”</p>
<p>Living as a mutant is a novel experience.</p>
<p>There’s something different from living as a Lifer. It feels like he switched his character while playing a game.</p>
<p>The worldview inside the mission is the same, but it is interesting.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung as a human had been normal.</p>
<p>He knew how to express reluctance toward the bad.</p>
<p>Those feelings slowly disappeared as a mutant however, and he even has fun watching such cruel scenes now.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t take his state too seriously. He has accepted that he is a mutant. He just thinks like a human.</p>
<p>He wants to go in.</p>
<p>He wants to go in and rip everything apart. All of them are low compared to him.</p>
<p>Thump thump.</p>
<p>“Ack! It’s doing it again.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung grabs his chest.</p>
<p>While maintaining his state as a mutant, his heart occasionally began to beat too fast. It isn’t just beating.</p>
<p>A subtle and inexplicable feeling comes over him whenever this happens.</p>
<p>It isn’t bad.</p>
<p>Can he call it excitement?</p>
<p>He felt better similar to that. He was cautious about it because it is unintentional and he cannot control it.</p>
<p>The manifestation of his instincts had been minimal when inside his battlesuit in human form because he suppressed himself, but not now.</p>
<p>It is on complete display.</p>
<p>The impulse to go wild is on fire. But he didn’t go crazy as he had done when he had been taken over by the Oriax.</p>
<p>He has perceptible reason.</p>
<p>His head still hurts when he thinks about that time.</p>
<p>It is an extremely unpleasant thing to lose oneself.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung.]</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>[An 800 to 900 person raid of Lifers has been summoned to the city outskirts. It seems a mission has been configured nearby.]</p>
<p>Lifers came in and out of the extensive territory that the three Universe Eyes are searching, and it seems this place has been chosen.</p>
<p>He ignored it before because they had been far away.</p>
<p>But it becomes a different story if a mid-size city where Bomb Ants and mutants are fighting has an effect on Lifers’ missions.</p>
<p>[What do you think about having the Bomb Ants retreat?]</p>
<p>If the mission is to kill the Bomb Ants, they will fail. He doesn’t care about the ordinary Bomb Ants, but he can’t leave the Queen Bomb Ant.</p>
<p>“Leave it for now.”</p>
<p>[The Lifers’ power is weak, but the mutants are gathered together. It will be fatal if they use a genocidal weapon.]</p>
<p>“We need to teach that bitch a lesson.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks at the Queen Bomb Ant and laughs.</p>
<p>He is sure.</p>
<p>If she evolves to level 7, she will attack him. There is a need to show her his importance before that.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>Odin’s prediction was right.</p>
<p>The Lifers didn’t assault the place where tens of thousands of mutants were scattered, and instead rained down genocidal weapons like white phosphorous shells.</p>
<p>With the long lasting Life Mission, Lifers’ point accumulation naturally increased. It isn’t hard to throw in a few.</p>
<p>Mutants below level 5 disappeared without even a scream under the bombs.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung focused only on the Queen Bomb Ant.</p>
<p>Odin calculated the orbit of bombs in real time and predicted release areas.</p>
<p>“I only need to keep the Queen alive.”</p>
<p>She’s a top level 6.</p>
<p>As long as she isn’t hit directly by the bombs falling from the sky, she won’t die from an indirect explosion.</p>
<p>That much, she can withstand.</p>
<p>Even indirect hits could be dangerous if they are repeated, but Odin, who is more precise than Cha Jun Sung, is watching out for this.</p>
<p>“They’re there too.”</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants climb on top of the Queen’s body and wrap her in layers. They have made themselves into a shield. A strong and durable shield at that.</p>
<p>Dozens of Bomb Ants carry the Queen and desperately run away. The surviving Bomb Ants followed behind them. The mutants also stopped fighting and scattered. It was just a union in the first place, so they don’t have a feeling of camaraderie.</p>
<p>A red flame covers the Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>They do not explode. The Queen could be injured if they do. They kept enduring it even though they were burning to death.</p>
<p>“It’s the leader!”</p>
<p>“Kill the group of mutants first! Surround them!”</p>
<p>“Left suppression shot!”</p>
<p>“Right suppression shot!”</p>
<p>Lifers aim at the Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>They are well aware that they need to kill the unified mutants first.</p>
<p>With shots fired from left and right, the range of movement for the Bomb Ants became more and more narrow.</p>
<p>They are gathering the Bomb Ants together so that it is easier to kill them.</p>
<p>On top of that, these Lifers flew. They assaulted in all different ways as though bombing from fighter planes.</p>
<p>Flying Bomb Ants went at the Lifers, but they were overwhelmed in numbers.</p>
<p>Flying Bomb Ants are born at a 1/100% rate compared to ordinary Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants were one-sidedly hit. The Lifers’ strategic tactics were outstanding, and the Bomb Ants’ power had been significantly decreased.</p>
<p>“Shall I get going?”</p>
<p>[… Are you going to kill Lifers?]</p>
<p>If Cha Jun Sung goes in, he would annihilate even a raid.</p>
<p>There could be differences based on members, but it would be the same even with level B Lifers.</p>
<p>“Ah. No matter how accustomed I’ve becomes to the idea of killing, I don’t kill innocent people. I’m just going to scare them a little.”</p>
<p>Whether it’ll become just a little scare or an unforgettable trauma, is up to the abilities of the Lifers.</p>
<p>Even so, they are above level C, so they won’t be peeing in their battlesuits.</p>
<p>“Go!”</p>
<p>The raid captain, a level B Lifer leading 9 forces, stood at the head of 900 people and chased the Bomb Ants. They intend on killing all of them without effort.</p>
<p>The Lifers split their roles.</p>
<p>3 forces spread out wide, created a mesh, and blocked it so other mutants couldn’t approach.</p>
<p>The other 6 forces focused on just the Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>The Queen Bomb Ant was desperate.</p>
<p>There are few of the enemy, but they are able to fly. Most of the flying Bomb Ants died during the first collision.</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants were pathetically swept under the attacks helplessly.</p>
<p>They don’t have an effect in the air if they self-destruct on the ground. All they can do is block the attacks with their bodies and run away.</p>
<p>The Queen Bomb Ant is running away to the advance base that they created not too long ago.</p>
<p>There isn’t much military force.</p>
<p>Just a few thousand.</p>
<p>There are a few advance bases, and they were created to control the respective regions they were in as their territory expanded.</p>
<p>The military force is divided, so it is difficult to form a large army in a short amount of time. The goal is to hide in an ant hill.</p>
<p>But they are surrounded, and running away itself isn’t easy.</p>
<p>Bullets rain down.</p>
<p>Lifers fly around swiftly and focus their attacks on the Queen Bomb Ant. If the Lifers hadn’t been able to fly, the Queen Bomb Ant would have fought even if she had to hit the sewers.</p>
<p>She would have been able to do something if the battle had been on ground.</p>
<p>“Groups 1 and 2 will block the Queen’s front. Groups 3 through 6 will take the sides and back. Groups 7, 8, 9 will maintain the net and keep the boundary.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Lifers in groups 1 and 2 increased their battlesuits’ output.</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants were moving among skyscrapers, so it was hard to catch them.</p>
<p>The location was changing from the city outskirts.</p>
<p>Buildings disappeared and plains began to appear. They were able to increase their speed because there were no obstacles.</p>
<p>Flap!</p>
<p>The sunlight gets blocked.</p>
<p>Groups 1 and 2 Lifers were trying to increase the chase speed, when they flinched. A black figure flapping a pair of wings.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung, with wings over 30m long from end to end, was blocking the Lifers’ path. He is alone, but he gave the feeling of filling up the entire world.</p>
<p>Hundreds of tails flail out like whips.</p>
<p>They move as if each one is alive, and soar toward the rigid Lifers.</p>
<p>Though he lacked Odin’s support through the battlesuit, the instinct of complete awakening played the role not unlike the battlesuit’s system.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung checked how many Lifers there were, calculated the direction to move in, and attacked. He did this all within a few seconds.</p>
<p>He took out the cutting force, so the Lifers yelled in pain under the force that was like getting hit with a bat.</p>
<p>They were all flung in different places. One person went through a building’s walls, rolled on the ground, and landed on the roof of a rusty car.</p>
<p>The Lifer wasn’t hurt.</p>
<p>He hadn’t hit to kill, so he just left the Lifer on top of the car. He only hit with an amount of power that the battlesuit’s armor could handle.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>Very few Lifers withstood the impact and maintained their shaky balance.</p>
<p>However, they trembled in fear from what they heard over their PDAs rather than from the unidentified mutant that suddenly appeared.</p>
<p>[Level A special mission Black Devil activated. Difficulty level is advancement.]</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 237</p>
<p>Raid captain slapped his cheek covered by his battlesuit, and woke himself up.</p>
<p>He thought he had been dreaming.</p>
<p>He briefly looked over the mission description, but the reward points were 8 billion.</p>
<p>This means the mutant in front of him is a level 8, and a top level 8 at that.</p>
<p>It doesn’t make sense. It feels like he is experiencing all of the bad luck he would have suffered from throughout his entire life right now.</p>
<p>“Cap – Captain…”</p>
<p>“Stay – Stay calm.”</p>
<p>The Lifers couldn’t remain calm.</p>
<p>They thought that today could be the last day of their lives.</p>
<p>A level 8 is a nightmare.</p>
<p>‘He’s pretty qualified as a captain.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung kept an eye on the raid captain’s behavior in the midst of this excitement. He doesn’t know about the captain’s abilities, but he seems to have talent as a leader. He becomes rational rather than panicking. He is thinking.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>As the head was blocked, the Lifers who had followed behind were stopped in flight. Hundreds of them have been blocked by Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>“Damn it! They are leaving the allied guild!”</p>
<p>“Damn!”</p>
<p>Lifers checked the mission description and left the battlefield.</p>
<p>They cannot return immediately, but they intend on running away.</p>
<p>3 forces of personnel got away as soon as Cha Jun Sung appeared.</p>
<p>He didn’t even want to know what they looked like.</p>
<p>They are all Lifers with a lot of experience. They can come up with a rough idea just by looking at the reward points.</p>
<p>Even a mission worth tens of thousands of points is difficult, but this isn’t something in the millions but billions. There’s no answer.</p>
<p>“Sh – Should we attack?”</p>
<p>“No! Wait!”</p>
<p>The captain quickly stopped his subordinate from taking action. Success is the only way for them to survive, but this mutant’s attitude is strange. All he does is watch them.</p>
<p>“If he’s a level 8, his intelligence will be similar to ours. We can just think that we’ve run into another person. Talking to him might work. Battle is our final option.”</p>
<p>[He is a wise leader. He wants to get control over the situation rather than challenge Lifer Cha Jun Sung. I think that it will end well.]</p>
<p>Odin translates the Lifers’ language for him.</p>
<p>It is hard to say where exactly they are from because they use several different languages, but the captain in charge speaks in Ukranian. He is from a country in Eastern Europe.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looks behind him.</p>
<p>The Queen Bomb Ant, who had run far away, has stopped and is watching them from afar.</p>
<p>Wouldn’t she think of getting her Bomb Ants together and coming back?</p>
<p>She really is a sly bitch.</p>
<p>She is acting as if they had never been running away, to come back and use Cha Jun Sung like a counterattack tool.</p>
<p>[Go back, you stupid bitch.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s roar was translated, browbeating the Queen Bomb Ant. This stable atmosphere will be completely ruined as soon as she comes back.</p>
<p>The level 8 vicious roar frighten the Queen Bomb Ant and Bomb Ants and make them retreat.</p>
<p>His roar had this kind of effect even from afar.</p>
<p>There is no need to try to put into words how it was for the hundreds of Lifers near him.</p>
<p>Tang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung felt a stinging pain in his shoulder and turned his head. It is a bullet twice the length of a human finger, from a reinforced rifle.</p>
<p>It didn’t go all the way in. This amount of force cannot get through his skin. It is so weakly stuck that it would fall out if he flexed his muscles.</p>
<p>It is situation that no one had been expecting. The area was swept in silence.</p>
<p>The Lifer who had pulled the trigger realized what he had done and began shaking in fear.</p>
<p>He attacked a level 8. He felt like he might go crazy.</p>
<p>His finger had relaxed under the extreme tension, and he had fired his reinforced rifle. But it had unfortunately hit Cha Jun Sung’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung pushed the bullet out with his muscles, and regenerated within 1 second.</p>
<p>A clear metallic sound rang as the bullet hit the concrete floor.</p>
<p>It is volatile.</p>
<p>All of the Lifers were frozen. They had been trying to end it quietly, but one person had messed it up. They cannot avoid it. They need to fight.</p>
<p>“That stung.”</p>
<p>“Korean?”</p>
<p>The raid captain asks.</p>
<p>His expression was hidden behind his battlesuit, but he was taken aback. This was the same for the other Lifers.</p>
<p>“If you can understand what I’m saying, listen carefully. I’ll let you live. Go back.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung could understand what the Lifers were saying as well thanks to Odin.</p>
<p>But he didn’t want them to know that he had understood.</p>
<p>It would be extremely suspicious for a mutant to be able to speak multiple languages. A one-sided warning should have an immediate effect.</p>
<p>“Captain?”</p>
<p>“Let’s go back.”</p>
<p>The captain decided to quit the mission.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s magnanimity and the ability to have a conversation was fortunate.</p>
<p>They can live.</p>
<p>Ring ring!</p>
<p>An alarm sounds.</p>
<p>It is a notice that they have the opportunity to quit their mission.</p>
<p>The Lifers’ faces brighten. The mission failure penalty isn’t much. They would just have some points taken away. That’s cheap compared to their lives.</p>
<p>They even thought about trying another mission in a different region, but western America is Black Devil’s territory.</p>
<p>That would be the wrong thing to do.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looked behind him again.</p>
<p>The Bomb Ants went into their advance base, and he couldn’t see them. His dominion will have more effect now.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s wings flapped and he left the Lifers, flying in the direction the Bomb Ants had disappeared in. He doesn’t care what the Lifers do.</p>
<p>He won’t bother them as long as they don’t inconvenience his mission.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Uh… Master.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I think someone has launched a Universe Eye.”</p>
<p>“Universe Eye?”</p>
<p>Tyrant questions his subordinate. The subordinate doesn’t sound sure either.</p>
<p>He wouldn’t have said ‘I think’ if he had been sure.</p>
<p>“I will pull up the screen.”</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>The battlesuits became interlocked, and the large city that the Rage guild is staying in came up on Tyrant’s hologram.</p>
<p>Tyrant watched the video carefully.</p>
<p>It is a video that a guild member had filmed moments ago with a micro reconnaissance robot.</p>
<p>The robot, resembling a dragonfly, discovers something and zooms in when it gets a view on something the size of a child’s fist.</p>
<p>“Hu – Hundred Eye?”</p>
<p>Tyrant’s voice quivers slightly. The Hundred Eye is a small search device that the Universe Eye ejects to cover a more extensive area.</p>
<p>It is a level S store item. How is that in this place?</p>
<p>“How was it discovered?”</p>
<p>“By coincidence. One of the guild members got bored and used one of his own micro reconnaissance robots. He says that he found it because he had been pushing it around here and there for fun rather than to do a search.”</p>
<p>“Has it been discovered?”</p>
<p>“The robot may have been in the Hundred Eye’s scan, but it shouldn’t have been caught because of our blocking devices.”</p>
<p>Radio wave blocking devices are spread out throughout the Rage guild’s camp.</p>
<p>If these are used, equipment of different frequencies instantly become neutralized.</p>
<p>The Rage guild uses these because of other Lifers outside of their guild. Mutant senses are dozens of times more sensitive than those of humans.</p>
<p>Because of that, they hate the sound of neutralized frequencies. They serve as a form of eradication like bug spray to mosquitoes.</p>
<p>“Level S. Is he nearby?”</p>
<p>To Tyrant’s best knowledge, there is only one other Lifer besides him who can own a Universe Eye.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung – there is only him.</p>
<p>Not if he is with the World Federation, but what if he is alone or with a small party? It is a chance for him to end it easily.</p>
<p>“Can we avoid him?”</p>
<p>“It may be possible if we take on the bothersome, but even this is uncertain. He moves fluidly, so we cannot predict his movements.”</p>
<p>Blocking devices need to be installed, so they cannot protect from movement.</p>
<p>That is why they create damage, but cannot provide that much help. They need to choose between going through blatantly or crushing it.</p>
<p>There are 10,000 people in the Rage guild. There are too many of them. They need to take extremely annoying measures if they all want to avoid the Hundred Eyes.</p>
<p>First off, passing through the city is out of the question.</p>
<p>Someone will get caught.</p>
<p>No matter what.</p>
<p>“Fine. Crush it. It’s better than getting caught. A Hundred Eye means that the Universe Eye is somewhere within a 100km radius.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>A subordinate left.</p>
<p>Tyrant became lost in the thought that he might get advancement and Cha Jun Sung simultaneously.</p>
<p>Without knowing what state Cha Jun Sung is in.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 238</p>
<p>Zip!</p>
<p>It isn’t a sound that was really heard.</p>
<p>But Odin heard it. They lost contact with a Hundred Eye in the southeast region of Canada.</p>
<p>There is no way it is from a machine error.</p>
<p>He is 99.9% sure it has been destroyed.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung let 3 Universe Eyes go in a sandwich method in order to find a powerful group of mutants. And then he raised a few more on top of that.</p>
<p>It is a sandwich.</p>
<p>Since he already sent in 3, he sent in more to have views on the entire area and to find where Tyrant would appear.</p>
<p>3 Universe Eyes drew an approximate circle and searched a wide area. Odin can see everything.</p>
<p>300 Hundred Eyes.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have much effect that one is gone, but Odin felt importance in the fact that it was destroyed.</p>
<p>It doesn’t seem like the deed of a mutant.</p>
<p>The Hundred Eye is fundamentally a machine. Machines are not alive. They are just inanimate objects that float around.</p>
<p>They do not smell or make noise. They do not have any elements that would draw the interest of mutants. It just has hundreds of lenses that run inside. Even those are hidden behind a special alloy coated in transparency, that the lenses cannot be seen from outside.</p>
<p>A mutant with special sight would be able to see them, but that is the basic idea.</p>
<p>[Check video.]</p>
<p>It is impossible to measure with the tremendous amount of information that the 8 Universe Eyes send in.</p>
<p>However, Odin has the volume to handle this amount of information. He was just a little late in checking the video footage at times because he does what the Universe Eye cannot and the volume is divided.</p>
<p>He doesn’t look at it all together, but plays them sequentially.</p>
<p>Odin made pulling up the footage that was taken before the Hundred Eye was destroyed a priority, and checked it before looking at the other videos.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>He can adjust the time slot and speed. Odin made the play time on the video a day before it was destroyed. He can’t look at too little or too much of it.</p>
<p>This much is just right.</p>
<p>If there had been signs that it would be destroyed, this is when it would have happened.</p>
<p>Zip!</p>
<p>The video comes up.</p>
<p>Odin did his duty whether he was in communication with Cha Jun Sung or not. Helpers worked harder than anyone else. They aren’t relaxing just because they are silent. The work they do just isn’t made public.</p>
<p>Hundreds of lenses save the direction they are facing in a video.</p>
<p>Mutants wander in the vicinity, unaware of the Hundred Eye’s existence.</p>
<p>[That?]</p>
<p>A figure that resembles a dragonfly.</p>
<p>A micro reconnaissance robot is caught on camera. It is a special alloy that is coated to make it transparent, but micro reconnaissance robots change their perspectives between detection like heat, infrared ray, and sound wave.</p>
<p>Hundred Eye showed the original figure with sound wave detection.</p>
<p>The micro reconnaissance robot that had been by the Hundred Eye’s side for about 10 to 15 minutes left. It will be going back to the Lifer who is controlling it.</p>
<p>The Hundred Eye is unarmed. This is the same for its main body, the Universe Eye. It doesn’t have the ability to attack, so it can only stay still and watch.</p>
<p>After this, time passed without anything special happening.</p>
<p>While Cha Jun Sung was busy, Odin supported him and focused on checking the video footage.</p>
<p>And right before it was destroyed, an attack came at the Hundred Eye from somewhere and penetrated it. The video cut off and stopped there. The attack must have been something like sniping.</p>
<p>He knows one thing from watching the video and something that makes him wonder.</p>
<p>What he found out was that in the area that the Hundred Eye was searching, there is an area the size of multiple stadiums that they cannot search.</p>
<p>This kind of case normally occurs when they use equipment with EMP capabilities. Or it could be due to a sound wave series – blocking devices that use sound.</p>
<p>It is also a necessity for Lifers because mutants hate it.</p>
<p>The question here is why they destroyed it.</p>
<p>Was there a reason to go the lengths to destroy it?</p>
<p>Were they bothered because they felt like they were being watched?</p>
<p>That could be it.</p>
<p>But it isn’t logical.</p>
<p>Because they like destroying other people’s equipment and causing them trouble? He cannot explain it clearly.</p>
<p>[Connecting to the Universe Eye’s wide range network. Executing observer mode.]</p>
<p>He had only filtered the footage sent to him until now. He hadn’t controlled the search system himself.</p>
<p>Big mistakes usually come from small mistakes. There are things that one can ignore, but he takes care of everything, whatever it is, because he does not want to let errors pass that could create bigger issues later.</p>
<p>Odin’s artificial intelligence goes into the Universe Eye of the destroyed Hundred Eye. It can no longer be called a simple equipment geared for searching. He is now able to use more of the micro features due to the observer mode. He left enough abilities in the PDA not to interfere with the mission.</p>
<p>He needs to find out who destroyed it.</p>
<p>A Lifer who advanced all the way to pioneer level in the virtual version will know what the Universe Eye is.</p>
<p>Helpers are artificial intelligence, not humans.</p>
<p>That is why they do not have biases. They leave open all possibilities. The only difference is whether the probability is large or small.</p>
<p>It could be an ordinary Lifer, but there is a high possibility that it is Tyrant who has entered the Black Devil mission. Odin knows where Tyrant’s initial summons area is.</p>
<p>Helpers communicate with each other.</p>
<p>That communication isn’t constant. It continues roughly for a month or so and then gets cut off. So with time, not even helpers know each other’s locations.</p>
<p>Gabenu will know.</p>
<p>He doesn’t get involved directly. This is what Jigneon wanted. He created this situation in order to clean up the mess Borteth has made, but he only gets involved up until Cha Jun Sung enters the mission.</p>
<p>Zing!</p>
<p>Odin called in the subsets of the Universe Eye he is controlling with his authority.</p>
<p>Since he is managing them himself, searching becomes more thorough.</p>
<p>If it is Tyrant, he will have guessed that it is Cha Jun Sung’s equipment. He must know since it is a level S store item.</p>
<p>He would never guess that Cha Jun Sung knows of his identity.</p>
<p>It was impossible to know that the one who destroyed the Hundred Eye out of countless Lifers, is Tyrant. If they throw bait, he will probably take it right away.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung, we’ll have to get ready.]</p>
<p>They need a battlefield for Cha Jun Sung. They will create a scene for their unwelcome guests.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Odin gave all of the information he acquired to Cha Jun Sung. Helpers are in tandem with the Lifers they are assigned to.</p>
<p>They have the obligation to grow their Lifers in the midst of top level missions. This is a partnership that the supervisors created in order to have a little more balance. Odin needs to help Cha Jun Sung with whatever he needs as long as it does not break the rules, so he just needs to tell Cha Jun Sung everything he saw and thought.</p>
<p>“Pick ones with wings.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung orders the Queen.</p>
<p>He needs a lot of flying Bomb Ants. The ones on ground become useless if Lifers change their battlesuits to flight mode. They might as well be sandbags. They are not completely useless, but there is a lot lacking in using them as their main means of attack. They desperately need something to cover this.</p>
<p>He can know just from watching the last battle.</p>
<p>They can suffer damages in a battle with mutants, but they were devastated by raid level Lifers.</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant understood what Cha Jun Sung meant. She must have felt something too because she didn’t argue with him.</p>
<p>Flying Bomb Ants are born at a rate of 1/100 of that of ordinary Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>If the Queen Bomb Ant takes the sacrifice, she can control the probability. It is consuming stamina and nutrients. In the aftermath of the battle, the number of Bomb Ants was reduced to 20,000. They have gone to less than half, since they were 50,000 before.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung decided to maintain the current number of ordinary Bomb Ants and to fill up the rest with flying Bomb Ants if they could. They made about 200 per day.</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant complained because it was tiring, but he had no intention of considering her comfort. Tyrant could come barging in at any moment.</p>
<p>As long as Cha Jun Sung didn’t hide and the size of the land they were on was limited, they would come face-to-face at some point and that time was approaching.</p>
<p>“We need at least 5000. The more, the better.”</p>
<p>There are 10,000 people.</p>
<p>They will all be levels B and C, the elite of Rage guild. In mutant terms, they will be levels 5 and 6, and Tyrant will be a level 8.</p>
<p>It’s a virtually impossible power.</p>
<p>He needs to be smart about it if he is to face off against a power like that. Of course Cha Jun Sung thought of an operation that could work.</p>
<p>It is a very basic and primitive operation.</p>
<p>First, he needs to strike powerfully when they don’t know anything in order to have a chance of winning.</p>
<p>He is doing that work in advance right now in a nearby city.</p>
<p>That place will become Cha Jun Sung and Tyrant’s battlefield. They won’t go elsewhere. They need to do it whether he lures them there or something.</p>
<p>[A Hundred Eye was just destroyed. This is the 4th one.]</p>
<p>“He’ll think he’s luring me to him, right?”</p>
<p>[He could be.]</p>
<p>When Odin couldn’t find Tyrant’s exact location, he cleverly exposed the Hundred Eyes to find an approximate area.</p>
<p>To predict Tyrant’s thoughts, he could be destroying Hundred Eyes to make Cha Jun Sung suspicious and to come looking for him.</p>
<p>Both sides are baiting the other.</p>
<p>In this, Cha Jun Sung has an advantage because he knows the other’s identity. He isn’t sure. It’s just what he thinks.</p>
<p>“Ant Hell.”</p>
<p>Operation name Ant Hell.</p>
<p>He will bring them all in and squeeze them to death.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 239</p>
<p>Dozens of tanks the size of buildings go down the road in a line. There were no lane boundaries because of the size of the tanks.</p>
<p>After riding for a while, they arrived at a city with no life to be found as per usual.</p>
<p>“Stop.”</p>
<p>Lifers reverse their tanks at Tyrant’s signal.</p>
<p>These large tanks will draw too much attention, so they need to go on foot. The Rage guild checks their gear. Their faces are hidden behind helmets, but their expressions are unusually grim. Even Tyrant retreated from his madness and acted with caution.</p>
<p>“That’s the axis.”</p>
<p>As a result of calculating the activity radius of the Hundred Eyes, there is a high chance that the Universe Eye is currently in that city. It could be a base.</p>
<p>Tyrant destroyed the Hundred Eyes in order to hide the Rage guild and to lure Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>At some point, they used the Hundred Eyes as indicators to find Cha Jun Sung. It had been easy to find the Hundred Eyes because they had micro reconnaissance robots everywhere.</p>
<p>That’s how they calculated the radius and arrived here.</p>
<p>[Master. We found the Universe Eye 600m above sea level.]</p>
<p>Tyrant smirks.</p>
<p>It is as he expected.</p>
<p>This is where it started.</p>
<p>2 raids, 2000 take the sky. 8 raids, 8000 are on ground.</p>
<p>[Shall we destroy it?]</p>
<p>[Do it.]</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>A meteor falls from far away. It is a phenomenon that formed as the Universe Eye fell. It lost its functions.</p>
<p>[Split into 2 raids and surround the city. Scourge everything that leaves.]</p>
<p>They block the air from east and west. It’s a small city.</p>
<p>The 2000 Lifers wearing battlesuits in the air couldn’t find anything. They have no doubt that Cha Jun Sung entered in a small group.</p>
<p>‘That’s right. You never liked going around in large groups. That’s the type of guy you are.’</p>
<p>He will postpone progress on Black Devil for now. There is no time limit.</p>
<p>It won’t be too late to finish it even after killing Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>There are only gains even if he fails.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang bang!</p>
<p>The small city becomes completely devastated due to weapons of mass destruction like white phosphorus shells and cluster shots. The fire power becomes concentrated, creating a big explosion. The buildings didn’t just come down, they were reduced to ashes. Mutants also disappeared. That kind of fire power would be dangerous even for a level B Lifer.</p>
<p>It would have little effect on Cha Jun Sung and his party members, but he isn’t trying to kill them. He is trying to cut off their flow with a surprise attack.</p>
<p>[Go in. Aim for a break.]</p>
<p>The 5 groups that had been surrounding the small city kept closing the distance.</p>
<p>They entered the city and inside the city, they got close enough to see each other. Even still, they couldn’t find Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>‘Did I guess wrong? With the route that the Hundred Eyes were destroyed, he should be able to figure out that the person doing it is coming this way…’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung will know that someone is destroying his gear. He will definitely be curious, and he could be tracking them instead.</p>
<p>That is this place.</p>
<p>If he came here, they should have met or there should have been a sign that they would run into each other.</p>
<p>The guild members who had been in the sky, came down.</p>
<p>The city is small, so they basically searched the entire place.</p>
<p>Tyrant looked at the buildings nearby.</p>
<p>‘He’s either coming from another region, or he’s hiding somewhere here.’</p>
<p>They just need to wait and see if it’s the former. If it’s the latter…</p>
<p>[Search everything.]</p>
<p>As soon as Tyrant’s search order fell, everyone went in except the 2 raids protecting him.</p>
<p>No. They were about to move.</p>
<p>Rumble.</p>
<p>“Earth – earthquake?”</p>
<p>“This feels similar to the earthquake in my country.”</p>
<p>An earthquake is a natural disaster.</p>
<p>The small city shakes crazily.</p>
<p>The Rage guild members aren’t taken aback. They would have been scared if they had been bare bodied, but they trusted that they could take on even nature if they were in their battlesuits.</p>
<p>The earthquake became stronger and cracks began to form on the surface like a web.</p>
<p>Tyrant watched and decided to get away. If the ground breaks and crumbles away, the guild power will be scattered.</p>
<p>As if it read Tyrant’s mind, the ground fell away before he could give his order.</p>
<p>It fell deep.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The Rage guild members turned on their boosters and maintained their balance. They increased their output and flew high.</p>
<p>“Phew! It looks like it could be hundreds of meters deep.”</p>
<p>One of the guild members whistles and changed his view to night mode, looking down into the abyss.</p>
<p>It looks endless.</p>
<p>“It’s weird.”</p>
<p>“What is?”</p>
<p>“Look around. Doesn’t the shape of the collapsed ground look strange?”</p>
<p>“Not that you say that, yeah. It’s really clean.”</p>
<p>The person questioning and the person agreeing.</p>
<p>Lifers look around.</p>
<p>They couldn’t tell while it was falling, but the shape of the collapsed grond really is unique.</p>
<p>It looks like a tool was used to dig out the area underneath where they were standing.</p>
<p>“Look up!”</p>
<p>This was blurted out.</p>
<p>The Rage guild members who had been trying to get out of the abyss looked up. Something dark red was falling on them.</p>
<p>Thousands of flying Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>The Rage guild members hadn’t been able to get out of the abyss yet.</p>
<p>They narrow as much as they get out.</p>
<p>The two groups collided without even greeting each other.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Bomb Ants self-destruct.</p>
<p>With explosions everywhere, the next round of Bomb Ants exploded, creating a chain explosion.</p>
<p>The Rage guild members who had almost escaped the abyss were stopped by the explosions. They could withstand one or two explosions, but their bodies were swallowed up with explosions raining down on them.</p>
<p>The battlesuits had only been getting scratched up, but slowly began to crack until they were completely destroyed. Guild members on board outside were either hit by the Bomb Ants’ wreckage or plummeting to the ground. They were dying one way or another.</p>
<p>Ack!</p>
<p>“Get through! Get through and get out!”</p>
<p>The cadres urge the guild members.</p>
<p>Their disadvantage in terms of the terrain is too severe. They cannot find a path out. The only way to survive is to face it head on.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang!</p>
<p>The top was still a mess – there was no progress.</p>
<p>The guild members’ abilities were high though, so they weren’t getting pushed back even if they weren’t able to push forward.</p>
<p>“You idiots! I’ll get through. Follow me!”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>Tyrant was frustrated with the way they were hesitating, and took the lead.</p>
<p>Bombs were alit in both of his hands. One of these can get rid of a radius of dozens of meters. If he throws them, it’ll clean up everything within that radius.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>“The side!”</p>
<p>“They’re coming from the sides too. Ex – explosion! Ack!”</p>
<p>Inside the collapsed ground, a hole forms in the wall and ordinary Bomb Ants throw their bodies to attack the guild members.</p>
<p>They self-destruct once they get close, and the Rage guild was getting attacked from two places – the ground and sky.</p>
<p>There was a lot of damage.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had planned the larger frame of the plan, while Odin planned the details.</p>
<p>This is the moment when the Ant Hell, a plan that can cause a lot of damage at once, can succeed.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Bastards. They’re giving so many.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung can hear notifications of the points he is earning.</p>
<p>Level C is 500,000. Level B is 5,000,000.</p>
<p>It is more than twice the amount of points for mutants. It is reflective of the fact that it is not easy to kill Lifers. On top of that, he got PK points separately and that was the real deal.</p>
<p>[You have earned 7,000,000 points and 4,200,000 achievement points.]</p>
<p>[You have earned 5,000,000 points and 3,000,000 achievement points.]</p>
<p>[You have earned 18,000,000 points and 10,800,000 achievement points.]</p>
<p>PK points are 10% of the points that the Lifer had. As time with Life Mission went on, Lifers accumulated a lot of points.</p>
<p>He gained points at an incredible speed.</p>
<p>He was just sucking up the points.</p>
<p>If he completes the mission, he might never have to worry about points again.</p>
<p>[The number of flying Bomb Ants has been reduced to the hundreds. Tyrant or the Rage guild will jump out soon. You must get ready.]</p>
<p>The Universe Eye searching this area was destroyed, so it was impossible to see inside the hole. However, they had a basic idea of what was going on.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung has a couple micro reconnaissance robots as well. Those robots checked the situation inside the hole for him.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>The inside of the hole shows up hazily on the PDA hologram. It was full of dust because of the Bomb Ants’ self-destruction and Lifers’ response. The view is very shaky because of the impact as well.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had gotten an understanding of the flow, and left for the battlefield.</p>
<p>He didn’t interfere in the battle, but stood next to the hole in the ground.</p>
<p>“Shall I do some fishing?”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 240</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung extended his tail and slid into the hole.</p>
<p>He is black, so he is automatically camouflaged into the dark environment. He can attack from a far distance of hundreds of meters based on how this is used.</p>
<p>He needs to reduce the Rage guild’s power as much as possible before all of the flying Bomb Ants are killed. In a messy fight, they are more likely to die by an arrow coming from far away.</p>
<p>Ack!</p>
<p>A Lifer looks at his chest.</p>
<p>He had been pierced by something black and sharp. He didn’t think for long. His heart had been penetrated.</p>
<p>This happened repeatedly.</p>
<p>He attacked with a concentration on fatal organs like the heart, brain, and lungs. He cut off their arms and legs if he couldn’t get the proper angle.</p>
<p>Rather than attacking half-heartedly, he had more to gain crippling them. Cha Jun Sung is an excellent hunter. He was so sneaky that the Rage guild thought that they were facing two types of mutants, and tried to kill them.</p>
<p>A Lifer who uses a sword like Cha Jun Sung does, brandishes his sword.</p>
<p>It was a metallic surprise.</p>
<p>But that was it.</p>
<p>His tail wrapped around the sword, went through the Lifer’s chin, and through his brain. Besides this, there were dozens of others who died in unique ways.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung roared and the Bomb Ants jumped out of the ant hill, falling into the abyss.</p>
<p>It became a sea of bombs.</p>
<p>The last attack.</p>
<p>Screaming continues. At the end of that screaming, the Rage guild that had suffered severe damages got through the Bomb Ants and rediscovered their freedom.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung stopped the boring hunting, spread his wings, and went into the middle of the Rage guild members.</p>
<p>And then he spun hard.</p>
<p>“Swivel. It’s a skill I named.”</p>
<p>Hundreds of tails, each of which have the sharpness of vibrating weapons, created a black storm with his body’s torque. It is an attack that digs into the weak point from beginning to end.</p>
<p>The Rage guild members who had not been able to get away, were ripped apart as if they had gotten stuck in a blender.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung killed those coming up.</p>
<p>It kept flowing on. He has to kill as many of them as he can before someone stops him by force.</p>
<p>“Bastard!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung kept maintaining the swivel, and his eye went to the location of the yell momentarily.</p>
<p>A red light sphere is flying at him.</p>
<p>It is a light bomb.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The light bomb creates off a hail of red light and has an evaporating phenomenon. It isn’t a power that he would get hit by even as a joke.</p>
<p>A level C Lifer would die upon getting hit. It is dangerous to have it even graze by. In the line of bombs, it is the strongest of firearms.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung would be able to withstand it with his body, but he has no intention of taking the hit. He still has a long way to go.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung created distance between himself and Tyrant and Rage guild.</p>
<p>Odin analyzes the damage situation. It applied to how many people were left.</p>
<p>[60% are dead. A lot injured are as well. Once the medical personnel fall behind, you will realistically be facing off against 2 or 3 raids.]</p>
<p>He killed 6000 people with the Ant Hell. It is a proper massacre. A giant massacre. Even so, Cha Jun Sung didn’t feel anything.</p>
<p>Rather, his blood boiled. He needs to kill them all anyway.</p>
<p>6000?</p>
<p>He needs to kill 4000 more. It’s a small number relative to the total 10,000 that he needs to kill.</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>“I can see it too.”</p>
<p>Tyrant’s glares at Cha Jun Sung with caution and distrust.</p>
<p>A huge mutant covered in black.</p>
<p>He is sure that this mutant is at the center of this mission, with its unique method of attack and cunning tricks.</p>
<p>How is it here?</p>
<p>He had come looking for Cha Jun Sung, but to find the level 8 Black Devil. Tyrant flared up in anger.</p>
<p>There isn’t a single thing related to Cha Jun Sung that has gone right.</p>
<p>It was always twisted and he was always the one to be disadvantaged.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung was always the one to benefit.</p>
<p>Look. Look at this ridiculous situation.</p>
<p>‘Did he lure me here?’</p>
<p>If he forces the puzzle pieces together, Cha Jun Sung could have figured out his identity and lured him to where the Black Devil is.</p>
<p>He grinds his teeth. Hard.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>While Tyrant was lost in his thoughts, Cha Jun Sung looked at the Rage guild with 9 of his eyes and then suddenly ran away.</p>
<p>“We’re chasing it.”</p>
<p>After suffering such damages, they need to catch it no matter what.</p>
<p>It is the main focus of this mission.</p>
<p>His priority switched from Cha Jun Sung to Black Devil. Tyrant only left 1 force to take care of the injured. He can’t leave more behind. He intends on using all of his power to kill Black Devil.</p>
<p>[They are following.]</p>
<p>“I’m at a disadvantage if it’s everyone including Tyrant.”</p>
<p>[I have made a lot of preparations. This is the world of mutants. Mutant Cha Jun Sung will be able to overcome the inferiority in numbers.]</p>
<p>“Yeah, since mutants are Lifers’ enemies. Let’s get into it.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung raised his flight speed.</p>
<p>It is the battlefield Jigneon created for him. The feast has been created for him. He needs to pick up the spoon himself.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>A blurry tail.</p>
<p>A black object stretches out and passes through the air. Its speed is comparable to that of a jet, and the air splits.</p>
<p>It is Cha Jun Sung in his awakened state.</p>
<p>He surpasses the speed of sound with abilities that transcend not just those of humans, but also of same level mutants.</p>
<p>Objects flew by, but Cha Jun Sung was aware of everything passing by. His superhuman sense of sight allowed him to do this.</p>
<p>“Where are they?”</p>
<p>[They are following 4km behind. The distance is closing.]</p>
<p>“Tyrant, right?”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung knows battlesuits well.</p>
<p>Flight consumes a lot of energy. Level C has less energy and it cannot reach the speed of sound.</p>
<p>It can get close, but that is it. The output cannot hold out.</p>
<p>30 minutes hadn’t passed since they started the chase, but most of them had already fallen back.</p>
<p>They must be busy charging their energy while in flight.</p>
<p>Level B is better than C, but it is still lacking to catch up with Cha Jun Sung. In Rage guild, Tyrant is the only one who has a battleship with the ability to catch up to and stay on Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Maybe if there had been level A Lifers, but there are no Lifers between levels S and B in Rage. There is a big gap in their own group.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looked back at the sound of a booster accelerating.</p>
<p>He is far, but clearly visible.</p>
<p>As Odin said, Tyrant closed in the distance. Cha Jun Sung isn’t a flying mutant. He is just imitating one with his body morphing. This is the fastest that he can fly.</p>
<p>[2km.]</p>
<p>“That guy will think that he can buy time even if he can’t beat me. His guild members will get here if he just holds on to me.”</p>
<p>Tyrant isn’t the type of person to take danger on behalf of others.</p>
<p>He is just trying to hold on to Cha Jun Sung a little until his subordinates arrive. Unless Tyrant does this himself, they will lose Cha Jun Sung due to a lack of ability.</p>
<p>[You will arrive at the first point in 15 seconds, the Crocodile Beak nest.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung goes higher.</p>
<p>Atop a cliff, he can see a small mountain. The Crocodile Beak nest is there.</p>
<p>They are mutants that aren’t that special, the size of a small car with the body structure of a typical bird and the mouth of crocodiles.</p>
<p>They are low level, too.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung reduced his flight speed and watched the Crocodile Beaks. They fly well. They are flying in the direction he wants them to go in.</p>
<p>“The leftovers!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Tyrant throws two light bombs. The Crocodile Beaks heading toward him were unable to avoid the attack, and are swept. It looks like about a fourth of them died.</p>
<p>The Crocodile Beaks recognize Tyrant as an enemy.</p>
<p>They witnessed a tremendous scene, but he doesn’t smell like a predator and there is only one of him.</p>
<p>They bravely ran at him, but there was no use.</p>
<p>1 minute.</p>
<p>That was the amount of time it took for Tyrant to annihilate all of the Crocodile Beaks. When he threw light bombs everywhere, they were all blown up without the chance to even run away.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had been stopped in the air for a moment, and began flapping his wings again.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 241</p>
<p>‘It’s using mutants?’</p>
<p>He cannot believe it.</p>
<p>The way this mutant fights is entirely different from the way the mutants he has experienced until now fought. It felt like he was going against an experienced and skilled soldier.</p>
<p>This mutant is using its environment and the mutants living in its territory.</p>
<p>In flight at that. It understands how battlesuits perform.</p>
<p>He gets goosebumps.</p>
<p>That isn’t just being smart. He can see the trap, but he can’t stop the chase. He needs to kill the Black Devil if he wants to complete the mission. He can’t know when he’ll find it again if he loses it now. The Rage guild has suffered too many damages.</p>
<p>They would just be taking a huge hit.</p>
<p>It could be creating a trap somewhere, so he needs to end everything in the initial place where they found it.</p>
<p>“Follow me.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung has the strength of a top level 8.</p>
<p>This means he has absolute influence over the mutants in this world.</p>
<p>While Cha Jun Sung was digging the Ant Hell with the Bomb Ants, he used the Universe Eye to search the locations of flying mutants below them.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been able to find many through the first 3 he had installed.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung and Tyrant may feel equally strong to mutants, but instinct makes them surrender to Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>He used his level 8 standing to his advantage. He is like a commander forcing flying mutants into battle whether they want to go in or not.</p>
<p>That is how he makes them go against Tyrant.</p>
<p>He doesn’t need to exercise his dominion or manage them separately. All he needs to do is know their location.</p>
<p>They won’t be a match for Tyrant’s combat skills, but they will be able to chip away at his power.</p>
<p>There are a lot of mutants. There are a lot of flying mutants too.</p>
<p>If he thrusts them all at Tyrant, he will reach his limit even if he is a complete level S.</p>
<p>If that happens, he will put his subordinates forward and Cha Jun Sung will kill them one by one. He will end it all once he has killed enough of them.</p>
<p>This is the land of mutants.</p>
<p>Not of Lifers.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is like a king here.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Lifers are savages who have invaded the king’s territory.</p>
<p>There are still many places he needs to go.</p>
<p>Most levels 3 and 4 are small in number, but there are a few that are useful even in small numbers.</p>
<p>“Those guys in particular will be able to deliver a hit.”</p>
<p>It is hard to find level 7-s, but he installed 8 Universe Eyes.</p>
<p>7 were left after one was destroyed, but there is no way that they won’t be able to find a level 7 with such an extensive search area. He found two species.</p>
<p>A male and female pair is living 120km away.</p>
<p>He needs to make Tyrant follow him there. He will test him a few times and then take the win. That will be the final place where he and Tyrant settle this.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Ack!</p>
<p>Tyrant yells.</p>
<p>His evil shout full of rage, rings throughout the area. Murderous intent emanates from it.</p>
<p>Blood drips down his battlesuit. Chunks of flesh are stuck on it too. Remnants of various species of mutants.</p>
<p>Rage guild members are standing around Tyrant.</p>
<p>About half a day has passed since they started chasing Cha Jun Sung, but there is no sign of progress. They keep feeling like they might catch him, but they never actually do. It actually felt like their allied powers were dwindling from tricks that they could see but had to endure even while knowing they were happening.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung, who Tyrant knows as Black Devil, made his escape routes the nests of flying mutants and moved through those. Whenever it feels like he is about to get caught, a mutant nest appears. There aren’t very many, but there are enough to hold Tyrant back.</p>
<p>When this kept happening, Tyrant fell back in order to save his energy, and ordinary Lifers filled in that empty space as Cha Jun Sung had expected.</p>
<p>Rage guild is superior in terms of power, but a few Lifers died every time they annihilated hundreds of mutants.</p>
<p>“There’s definitely an effect.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung looked at Tyrant in satisfaction.</p>
<p>Bringing different mutants together and controlling them is hard even for Cha Jun Sung. He would be able to do it if he wanted to, but it would be extremely difficult.</p>
<p>Dominion is forced. It doesn’t bring out sincerity. He chose the Bomb Ants because if their unique breeding power and efficiency.</p>
<p>[I think you will be able to lure them to the nest.]</p>
<p>“I’ll have to. There’s still a lot of them left, but it’s time to take the bait.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung fell behind Tyrant and attacked the Rage guild members from among the mutants.</p>
<p>He used the mutants as shields.</p>
<p>He was able to reduce the force that had followed by about 30 to 40%.</p>
<p>“He’s more concerned with his pride than he is about the damages wreaked on others. I’m sure he thinks it’s fine if his guild members die out as long as he can catch me. Though he’ll probably see the reduced force at the end of the mission and go crazy.”</p>
<p>It isn’t a personality that can simply be described as egotistic and proud.</p>
<p>Strategist, Blood King, and Dark Side would have come up with the optimal plan to take him on rather than chasing him like this. There is only one reason that Cha Jun Sung knows of for why Tyrant is doing this.</p>
<p>“He thinks of his guild members as expendables.”</p>
<p>What are expendables?</p>
<p>Something you use once and throw away.</p>
<p>He thinks that he can replace them whenever he wants, so he is chasing him to such extents while suffering devastation.</p>
<p>That persistence resulted in his force being seeded out by the flying mutants that Cha Jun Sung brought them to.</p>
<p>He could do this dozens more times if they were to go farther away, but that would take them away from a level 7 domain.</p>
<p>He needs to mind his energy too. Cha Jun Sung will have to finish it up in the end.</p>
<p>He cannot kill the entire Rage guild by pushing subordinate mutants that die out quickly, on them.</p>
<p>He can’t just try to make gains. He needs to be prepared to lose, too.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung intends on ending this at the nest that they will go to next. They will become reliable allies.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t exercise his dominion over level 7 flying mutants in the first place because he knew that they would not succumb readily.</p>
<p>They are with hundreds lower level mutants, so he would have to kill them too if they got into a fight. So what could he do? He can only use them like this.</p>
<p>He could take a lot of damages with repulsive force if he tried to exercise dominion by force, and he discovered them later than he did the Bomb Ants.</p>
<p>Half a day had passed since he started running away from Tyrant.</p>
<p>It is a long time considering Cha Jun Sung’s speed at 120km, but he had been late in arriving because he had gone back and forth here and there.</p>
<p>“I see it.”</p>
<p>A bustling metropolis.</p>
<p>High rises are lined up.</p>
<p>They are on the roof of a building so high they can’t see the ground. On top of the highest buildings at the center, in the middle of a bustling metropolis.</p>
<p>They are a pair of 9 Bijous.</p>
<p>As birds with 9 wings, they look very strange.</p>
<p>With feathers from head to hip, they look like western dragons other than the fact that they don’t have tails. Their heads were those of birds and not dragons, and their coats were made of fur and not scales.</p>
<p>Their sharply curled toenails look exactly like chicken feet. To put it simply, they look like the semblance of birds were forced onto the bodies of dragons.</p>
<p>They have two pairs of wings on either side, four pairs of wings with another single wing on their backs. The wing on the back controlled directions for quick turns. In airplane terms, they play the role of rudders. That is why they are much more advantaged in aerial war.</p>
<p>Flying mutants are in place in the buildings near the 9 Bijou in rank order, and they are not the same species.</p>
<p>They are underlings that are clinging to a stronger being. They number in just hundreds, but they can be called a force because they are made up of levels 5 and 6.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung found his destination, stopped flapping his wings, and met the 9 Bijous’ nest at eye level.</p>
<p>Then he made a move to let them know that he arrived.</p>
<p>Kik?</p>
<p>The female turned her long neck like a giraffe’s and looks at Cha Jun Sung. There is murderous intent in her eyes. The sleeping male also woke up.</p>
<p>His reaction is the same.</p>
<p>They show the desire to kill him immediately.</p>
<p>“They’re pissed.”</p>
<p>[You played around with them so much, so it’d be weirder if they weren’t.]</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung bothered the 9 Bijous a little for practice before Tyrant arrived.</p>
<p>He didn’t fight them, but he kept challenging them from far away and running away.</p>
<p>These guys didn’t surrender to him like other mutants did.</p>
<p>They are doing their level’s worth.</p>
<p>The 9 Bijous withstand his power unlike the other mutants that got scared out of their wits whenever Cha Jun Sung roared.</p>
<p>“I need to call them in. Can’t chase them away.”</p>
<p>He can’t roar at the 9 Bijous and send them to Tyrant. They don’t run away toward Tyrant, and come at him.</p>
<p>He realized after failing a few times. He needs to call them from the direction that he is going in.</p>
<p>[Tyrant will catch up in 30 seconds.]</p>
<p>“Good.”</p>
<p>The 9 Bijous only watch Cha Jun Sung far away. They don’t take any definitive actions.</p>
<p>But when he got closer…</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>The male and female spread their nine 40 meter wings that are a few times Cha Jun Sung’s size, and soar into the sky. He didn’t come here to fight them. He came to instigate.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had been keeping distance between Tyrant and himself, and now ran away toward Tyrant. The 9 Bijous are coming from behind him and Tyrant’s group is coming from the front.</p>
<p>They were about to overlap, but he is relaxed.</p>
<p>It is just 30 seconds.</p>
<p>He reduced the time so rapidly it couldn’t be felt, and they were coming from either side so Cha Jun Sung and Tyrant quickly met up.</p>
<p>“9 – 9 Bijous!”</p>
<p>The Rage guild hesitates. Tyrant is taken aback too.</p>
<p>In that time, Cha Jun Sung bypassed the Rage guild, killed a few, and went by.</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>The 9 Bijous come down on the Rage guild members and Tyrant, who haven’t been able to get a handle on the situation.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 242</p>
<p>Kyak!</p>
<p>A pair of 9 Bijous and hundreds of levels 5 and 6 mutants mix with the Rage guild, fighting with them. They don’t even know why they are fighting each other.</p>
<p>Just because they saw each other and collided?</p>
<p>The Rage guild wanted to avoid meaningless energy consumption, but that is not the case for mutants. They are beings that act on instinct rather than reason. They recognized the Lifers as enemies without thinking deeply into it. They were just going at the Lifers without considering the consequences.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung fought as well.</p>
<p>The 9 Bijous alone cannot take on the Rage guild. They will cause a lot of damage, but they will all eventually be killed.</p>
<p>This is because Tyrant is there.</p>
<p>So he needs to get Tyrant separate. It would be good if they killed him, but he isn’t an opponent that they can kill within a short amount of time.</p>
<p>“Black Devil!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung breaks up the Rage guild members and goes at Tyrant. Bullets rain on him and all kinds of bombs fly at him, but his strong body withstands all of it and pushes through. Then he brandished his tail at length.</p>
<p>Rage guild members’ hips get sliced through. Their upper and lower bodies were separate – instant death.</p>
<p>Tyrant of course, avoided this attack. That is what Cha Jun Sung had intended.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went at Tyrant all of a sudden and body checked him. He followed after Tyrant who went flying, and slammed his shoulder into him.</p>
<p>Tyrant plummeted to the ground with the tremendous impact from the successive blows. Cha Jun Sung followed after Tyrant and watched the situation in the sky.</p>
<p>They are deep in battle.</p>
<p>Tyrant won’t be able to support them. They are two level 7-s and there are too few level B Lifers.</p>
<p>They need at least 1000 people to take on the 9 Bijous. It doesn’t matter even if hundreds of level C Lifers go running in as well. There are a bunch of levels 5 and 6, too.</p>
<p>Boom boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant finds his balance by turning on his booster as he fell. But that was after Cha Jun Sung had already gotten in front of him.</p>
<p>His tail became sharp like a spear and jabs into the sky. Tyrant’s battlesuit predicts the attack path and analyzes Cha Jun Sung’s pattern. Tyrant avoids the attacks and takes out a light bomb. He is going to reverse the attack.</p>
<p>[He will have analyzed the pattern by now. But analyzing a body morphing mutant’s pattern is impossible.]</p>
<p>Odin was sure.</p>
<p>There is no way to know how he will attack, with what. On top of that, Cha Jun Sung is also a Lifer before he is a mutant.</p>
<p>He knows a lot about his enemy and himself, but Tyrant only knows about himself. It is an unfair fight. It’s because Borteth broke the rules.</p>
<p>Zing.</p>
<p>In an attack like flash of lightning, Tyrant set off the light bomb from his side.</p>
<p>He had chosen an extreme measure when Cha Jun Sung didn’t fall.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s body rips.</p>
<p>His skin burned from the light bomb’s power.</p>
<p>It isn’t severe, but there is damage. It really does have a lot of power.</p>
<p>‘It’s configured in affiliation series with high temperature and explosion like in the virtual version. They focused on making the armor lightweight too.’</p>
<p>The heat fades away and Tyrant appears. His battlesuit is blackened, but that is insignificant. It seems he modeled it like that since he is someone who uses bombs.</p>
<p>On top of that, his armor is thick like Han Chang Jin’s Iron Defense. As someone who uses bombs, he can’t leave out the possibility of having to set them off at close range.</p>
<p>Under the assumption that he is wearing a level S battlesuit, he would have caught Cha Jun Sung already without having to come all the way here if he had been a speed-focused Lifer.</p>
<p>Tyrant’s is level S, but it is on the slow side. This is because of the armor.</p>
<p>‘I’m sure it’ll be durable, too.’</p>
<p>As thick as the armor is, it’ll have more defensive power and durability.</p>
<p>He knows a lot including Tyrant’s combat style, but he doesn’t know up to where his battlesuit is focused in performance. He will figure out the details after facing off. It is fastest to learn with his body.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill you!”</p>
<p>Tyrant who is in the ground, growls like an angry tiger. As long as it has come to this, he needs to kill this mutant himself. It isn’t a situation in which he can expect support.</p>
<p>‘If it’s a level 8.’</p>
<p>As far as Tyrant knows, a 9 combination battlesuit with a complete Lifer’s combat ability in the virtual version was stronger than level 8, but weaker than level 9.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is the only one who succeeded in a level 9 Evil Queen raid with a 10 combination battlesuit. He has only fought a level 8 once, but this mutant feels similar. That is why he can win against the Black Devil in front of him.</p>
<p>‘Stupid bastard. Blame it on inexperience.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung read Tyrant’s self-confidence and clucked his tongue in his mind.</p>
<p>Lifer combat ability is similar by level to the virtual version, but mutants are different. They are a little stronger. That’s the feeling he got from fighting Vanessa.</p>
<p>He lost in a 2 against 1 fight when Vanessa went through her second awakening. They might have been on the same level if they had been going one-on-one, but a loss is a loss.</p>
<p>Vanessa is just close to level 9, she isn’t a complete level 9. But he couldn’t beat her with a 10 combination battlesuit.</p>
<p>‘The virtual version is a game. The operator can control the balance, but the reality version is reality. Mutants advance too.’</p>
<p>Even with a full setting of a 10 combination battlesuit and the 10th stage of body modifications, he doesn’t have confidence against a level 9.</p>
<p>It’s 100% death.</p>
<p>So a 9 combination needs no words. Narsiel also saw that of the 36 Rankers, Cha Jun Sung isn’t in an assisting role, but in militant configuration. If he is at Red Eye and Inferno’s level, two people will have to go at him. Level 8 isn’t as easy as Tyrant is thinking.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is at an advantage even with simple comparison, but he even knows Tyrant’s combat style. They fought several times in the virtual version.</p>
<p>‘I’m going to win.’</p>
<p>He played a virtual battle in his mind multiple times. He won by slight difference. It wasn’t reality, but he doesn’t think that it’ll be much different.</p>
<p>Tyrant’s chest opens and dozens of light bombs spread all over his body. He is taking them out all at once to use them whenever he needs them rather than having to take them out one by one.</p>
<p>Light bombs hang from his combat vest like grenades. It’s just that they were dispersed instead of staying on his chest. It seems they are stuck to him with magnets. And a few went down his back, past his hip and butt, to stop at his achilles heel.</p>
<p>‘It’s a landmine.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung pretended not to notice.</p>
<p>As soon as he said this, the one that had been on Tyrant’s achilles heel dug into the ground. He can’t see it happening because Tyrant is blocking it, but he doesn’t need to see to know.</p>
<p>Tyrant can set off this light bomb installed as a landmine whenever he wants to.</p>
<p>He suffered quite a bit when he first fought against Tyrant because of light bomb landmines.</p>
<p>It is better not to move in areas where light bomb landmines have been installed because there’s no way of knowing when they will go off. It is a good way of getting into the enemy’s weakness.</p>
<p>Tyrant finished burying the bomb and took position.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung doesn’t retreat either. The fight is over once the head is dead. It’s time to face off properly.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Pipipipit!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s tail and fingers get longer. Dozens of meters is the basic. He approached Tyrant and stayed as far from him as he could so they wouldn’t collide.</p>
<p>The power of the light bombs is burdensome.</p>
<p>Their power becomes completely different according to the amount of energy Tyrant injects.</p>
<p>If he injects weakly, it is just a few times the power of a grenade. But if it’s enough to use up an entire energy core, it could flatten a small city. Tyrant is a medium distance Lifer, not short or long distance.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is maintaining a long distance, and Tyrant is using all of his strength to narrow the distance.</p>
<p>“Damn mutant! I won’t let you die easily!”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t respond.</p>
<p>It’s psychological warfare.</p>
<p>Tyrant pretends to get excited in order to make his opponents put their guard down. His personality changes by situation.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>The light bomb mode changes.</p>
<p>Then, it chased Cha Jun Sung everywhere he went like a guided missile.</p>
<p>‘It’s out. One of the annoying things.’</p>
<p>Induced light bomb.</p>
<p>It is an annoying technique. It’s work to even hit it and fling it out. It explodes as soon as it gets hit. But he doesn’t really want to keep avoiding it either.</p>
<p>Tyrant and the induced light bomb are separate. It is straining to handle Tyrant and the induced light bomb separately.</p>
<p>‘Let’s just block it once.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s left arm changes into a rectangular shield.</p>
<p>He is applying White Queen’s technique.</p>
<p>He flung the light bomb coming at him in that state.</p>
<p>Bang bang bang bang bang!</p>
<p>The same impact exploded five times in succession.</p>
<p>The shield crumples.</p>
<p>It regenerated right away as if he had never gotten hurt, but his left arm feels strange.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 243</p>
<p>He understands the concept, but he can’t make it naturally like Black Lord can. He doesn’t know whether it’s a difference in ability or practicality. The important thing is that it isn’t created the same way Black Lord makes it.</p>
<p>‘Let’s just accept that I’m lacking. He’s a level 9. That means he’s complete as a mutant. What I can do… is up to what I’m capable of.’</p>
<p>Papapapat!</p>
<p>As soon as Cha Jun Sung moved, TyIts power is definitely stronger than a vibrating or rifle series weapon. The only weapon that can approach the bomb’s power is the hand cannon.</p>
<p>If the opponent he is fighting now was a Ranker like Glare Gun or Boom Buster, he would have fought at close range. Long range is their deal.</p>
<p>Tyrant throws another induced light bomb.</p>
<p>He is using them more actively because he saw their effect. There aren’t fouls in a fight, but it is nasty. After taking five hits, his left arm shield was reduced to rags. He didn’t make them top strength, but he can be confident that it is harder than steel.</p>
<p>‘I have something in mind too.’</p>
<p>Unless he can’t completely avoid it, he can’t keep getting hit for the sake of experimenting. He needs to save the energy in each of his cells if he wants to win.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s thigh rapidly swells. Powerful lower body force pushes his body forward like a spring. He soars into the sky as he spreads his wings.</p>
<p>Since he is the designated target, the induced light bomb follows him.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung joined the battle between Rage guild and the 9 Bijous. It is a busy place.</p>
<p>No matter how precise a chasing system is, he can avoid it here.</p>
<p>The induced light bomb explodes.</p>
<p>It sweeps the Rage guild and mutants. Tyrant stopped at nothing to try to kill Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung protected himself by placing living shields in front of him. There’s no reason to watch out for others. He only needs to protect his own body. He entered alone, so he can leave alone.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung kept weaving in and out to avoid attacks with much more ease than it seemed the size of his body would allow for. Tyrant watched this and calculated his escape route and used his booster to block his path. He used all of his induced light bombs. If he wants to use them again, he needs to be proactive.</p>
<p>“He’s a full body morphing mutant. It’s like fighting with smoke.”</p>
<p>Tyrant grumbles in complaint.</p>
<p>His attacks vary and keep changing. It isn’t easy to analyze his pattern. Psychological warfare doesn’t work either because he’s smart.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung moved his hand, and Tyrant flinched. It isn’t because he’s scared. It is a reflex. He needs to react if Cha Jun Sung comes at him with a surprise attack.</p>
<p>But Cha Jun Sung who saw the reflex, thinks differently. Old habits die hard. He is watching the old habits take form again.</p>
<p>[He’s only trying to maintain a middle distance. He won’t come in close range.]</p>
<p>It is so.</p>
<p>Tyrant stuck to a middle distance.</p>
<p>It is like Cha Jun Sung insisting on long distance on the surface, but there is a difference.</p>
<p>‘Light bombs are dangerous. That’s why I’m avoiding getting in close range. Tyrant is going middle distance because he knows it’s dangerous too.’</p>
<p>This is the same.</p>
<p>He is confronting only at middle and long distance because of light bombs. There is one more reason why he is creating more distance than Cha Jun Sung. It is a disadvantage that only a few people know.</p>
<p>Close range, middle distance, long distance. Everyone has a distance that they are specialized in.</p>
<p>But they always need to keep all distances in mind.</p>
<p>How many things in the world go as they wish?</p>
<p>This is in fights as well.</p>
<p>There’s no way the opponent will let him maintain their own distance.</p>
<p>‘He hates close range fights that get physical. Why? Because he isn’t confident in them. That’s why his combat style changed like that in the first place.’</p>
<p>Tyrant is weak in close range battles.</p>
<p>Even similar affiliation Nuclear has the ability to fight close range Rankers like Cha Jun Sung when necessary.</p>
<p>But Tyrant can’t do that.</p>
<p>He strangely doesn’t have a talent for close range fighting. Cha Jun Sung told him about that disadvantage multiple times.</p>
<p>With a self-righteous personality that doesn’t let him listen to others’ advice, he believes everything he thinks is right so he probably heard it through one ear and let it out through the other.</p>
<p>This is the result.</p>
<p>He still hasn’t fixed it. He’s basically saying that he will just live like this forever. Cha Jun Sung can understand it to an extent.</p>
<p>If he wants to approach Tyrant at close range, he needs to have that skill.</p>
<p>There will only be about 10 Lifers in both the virtual and reality versions who can get through the middle distance.</p>
<p>Rankers like Cha Jun Sung, Weapon Master, Chamma Sword, and Blood King who generally use vibrating weapons as their main weapons are these cases. Other than Tyrant, distance series Rankers win their distance fights in the first place. They do not narrow the distance dangerously.</p>
<p>‘If the distance is narrowed… I’m sure he’ll set off light bombs like crazy. I can’t close in without a plan either. That’s dangerous to us both.’</p>
<p>Tyrant’s disadvantage is that he is weak in close range, but he isn’t such an easy subject that he can just go in without a plan. He knows that much.</p>
<p>‘I’ll use that.’</p>
<p>The supervisors and Odin found out that he’s a mutant but they haven’t found out that he and Black Lord are the same, so this is a skill that he practiced cautiously so as not to get discovered.</p>
<p>He wanted to hide it till the end, but his life is on the line in this fight. There’s no use for it if he dies. He needs to use everything he can.</p>
<p>‘Dark tent.’</p>
<p>Success?</p>
<p>He’s never tried it.</p>
<p>rant threw dozens of light bombs into the air.</p>
<p>It’s an air mine.</p>
<p>They float near the person who threw them and explode when something touches them. It is a difficult technique for Cha Jun Sung to handle with his large body.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung compacted his body as much as he could. He became almost as small as Tyrant. He reinforced his coat in that state, and forced his way through.</p>
<p>The distance closes in and all of the cells in his body activate. He can feel each movement. He cannot explain the principle. He can just do it.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went through the overflowing flames, hugged Tyrant, and fell to the ground. He has him in a firm grip with both arms, so Tyrant can’t get out.</p>
<p>‘I’ll withstand it. And I’ll lock you up and kill you.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung made his decision. His body turned dark and swallowed up the area. To be more precise, it swallowed Tyrant who was struggling to get out of his arms.</p>
<p>“Bastard! What have you done to me!”</p>
<p>Tyrant yells.</p>
<p>He had been fighting fiercely with Black Devil just now, something spread suddenly like black paint and made his sight go dark. He can’t think of clear words to explain this phenomenon.</p>
<p>Is this a unique technique that mutants have like battlesuits? There’s no way to know.</p>
<p>“Light on.”</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>A light shines inside the dark tent. Tyrant’s mood soured.</p>
<p>A dome shape chunk of flesh covered in hideous, writhing veins blocks him. He can’t see a way out. It seems he has to create one.</p>
<p>“Like this!”</p>
<p>He changed the visual mode multiple times in order to figure out what the tent is, but it was useless. This giant chunk of flesh is Black Devil.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>A light bomb activates.</p>
<p>He can just blow away something like this.</p>
<p>Spat!</p>
<p>Did he know what he was going to do?</p>
<p>Sharp thorns come out of Tyrant’s side. He didn’t feel anything, not a trace or a sound.</p>
<p>His battlesuit’s sensor detected the attack and he was able to barely avoid it. The problem is what came after.</p>
<p>The first attack was just the beginning.</p>
<p>Ping ping ping!</p>
<p>Hundreds of thorns come sticking out from everywhere and it looks like a porcupine’s back. He didn’t have the time to take care of the situation here.</p>
<p>Tyrant’s body movements become busier.</p>
<p>He goes into a cold sweat inside his battlesuit. He didn’t see this kind of mutant even in the virtual version.</p>
<p>The thorns are simply a basic attack. Tangled tentacles danced and tried to tie around him like a giant hand trying to hit him.</p>
<p>‘I need to hurry. There’s too much energy and nutrient consumption.’</p>
<p>This dark tent is a half. The shape is similar to Black Devil’s, but it’s much less durable. It will rip after a few light bombs.</p>
<p>He might be able to recover with rapid regeneration, but there is a limit to that.</p>
<p>His breath catches with just his efforts to maintain it and attack. He can’t multitask.</p>
<p>It’s best to not go through rapid regeneration if he can.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung who became the dark tent’s subject realized what it felt like. He moved major organs like his nucleus to safe places. He can see all of Tyrant. It was like watching him with hundreds of security cameras.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Three light bombs stuck to the dark tent explode. That attack rips the outer wall and the world outside shows. Cha Jun Sung quickly regenerated.</p>
<p>He cast it with determination, but it’s impossible to use this technique again when it’s hard to even maintain it. He can’t let Tyrant out so easily.</p>
<p>He needs to kill him.</p>
<p>If he can’t kill him, he needs to take two of his arms and legs at the least. He needs to reduce his combat ability as much as he can.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 244</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>Damages increase on the battlesuit.</p>
<p>His main body will be fine but like with a mutant’s awakened state, the fight is won once the battlesuit is destroyed.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s dark tent repeatedly ripped and regenerated. Besides a physical fight, they were in a battle of attrition. The one who gets pushed back, loses.</p>
<p>Writhing.</p>
<p>A chunk of flesh coalesces on the ceiling and creates Cha Jun Sung’s bust. He is going to exercise physical force on Tyrant who is trying to avoid the attacks.</p>
<p>‘Leg.’</p>
<p>Legs over arms. This makes him lose mobility. It is worse to not be able to walk around than it is to not be able to use arms.</p>
<p>While busy, Cha Jun Sung quietly fell to the bottom.</p>
<p>At that moment, Tyrant looked up and met Cha Jun Sung’s eyes.</p>
<p>“I knew you would come out! Die! You disgusting mutant!”</p>
<p>Tyrant picks up his left arm.</p>
<p>There is a light bomb in his hand. Cha Jun Sung saw this and his face fell. He can’t avoid it. They will both get hurt at this close range, but there’s nothing he can do.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Tyrant’s arm gets cut off. A light bomb goes off at the same time. He must have put a lot of energy into it, because the explosion was tremendous. It must be multiple times of the usual.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s body is burned to ashes.</p>
<p>He didn’t die. It’s a burn. But a burn is created on a foundation of stamina and nutrients, so he lost that much and there are injuries to his dark tent as well.</p>
<p>Rapid regeneration becomes slower and slower. It is proof that his strength is becoming depleted.</p>
<p>Tyrant is pushed by his light bomb’s explosion, thrown against the outer wall, and falls.</p>
<p>He can see the part for his left arm over there. It is empty inside. The part is fine, but the cut off arm inside seems to have melted in the heat.</p>
<p>Tyrant sighs. His internal organs were shaken. Even so, he didn’t stay on the ground. He needs to fight to his death if he wants to live.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The part that Tyrant was leaning on bounced out briefly and hit his back. The inside is Cha Jun Sung’s space. Everything moves at his will.</p>
<p>“This! This!”</p>
<p>Tyrant fell forward and held the cut section with his right hand.</p>
<p>He howled.</p>
<p>His arm is cut off, but his abilities from 10 stages of body modifications and his battlesuit treated itself and the wound stopped spreading early.</p>
<p>However, there is no way he doesn’t see that the situation is changing disadvantageously.</p>
<p>He needs to get out of here. He needs to do it, but things aren’t going the way he wants them to.</p>
<p>“I’ll kill all of you! I’m going to sweep this whole place! I’m going to be the only one left!”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Tyrant’s battlesuit lights up red.</p>
<p>It grows more and more condensed, and then goes into the light bomb he is holding in his right hand. An incredible amount of energy is becoming concentrated.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung felt something ominous coming from Tyrant’s actions. After living with Bomb Ants for a time, he thought of the term “self-destruct”.</p>
<p>He can’t tell if that’s really what this is, but it isn’t something he can just laugh and pass over.</p>
<p>“Crazy bastard!”</p>
<p>Korean.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s mouth had been shut until now, and he finally opened it.</p>
<p>Right before the light bomb went off, the insane Tyrant’s eyes shook.</p>
<p>But that was it. It was too late. He can’t stop the explosion now.</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>The dark tent that had swallowed Tyrant evaporated under the heat of the light bomb. It is a blinding and beautiful red explosion.</p>
<p>Tyrant and Cha Jun Sung who had been inside hadn’t been able to avoid the light.</p>
<p>The energy Tyrant had injected into the light bomb was 80% of his battlesuit. The amount of energy in a level S is tremendous and he basically injected the majority of it, but the explosion range wasn’t large considering this.</p>
<p>It seems to be a 50 to 60m radius measuring by eye, but it is small enough to be visible in whole from the top of a building with a few floors.</p>
<p>But the atrocity Tyrant committed isn’t as simple as it looks. A crater that goes dozens of meters deep formed at the center of the explosion in a constant curve. It is as though he scooped out that area.</p>
<p>Also, though the explosion is over, the atmosphere is hazy. From far away, it looked like there was an opaque film over it.</p>
<p>The space is in a lull.</p>
<p>Rage guild members put their battlesuits into full function to look for Tyrant.</p>
<p>He can’t die.</p>
<p>None of the guild members are truly loyal to Tyrant. He isn’t someone worth showing sincerity to.</p>
<p>However, they need Tyrant’s abilities and the powerful foundation that provides him with, so they follow him without another option. If Tyrant dies, the guild will be destroyed. They might be able to go into Bloody Kingdom, but they won’t have the upper hand in Japan anymore.</p>
<p>The 9 Bijous who sustained minor injuries from the Rage guild’s concentrated attack go back to their nest. About 100 mutants follow them.</p>
<p>They had been swept into the atmosphere of war, but came to their senses at the sound of the explosion.</p>
<p>There had been hundreds of mutants, and a lot of them had died.</p>
<p>That many Rage guild members died as well, but they thought that going beyond this was meaningless. The Rage guild members didn’t follow after the retreating 9 Bijous.</p>
<p>They are tired.</p>
<p>They don’t want to fight.</p>
<p>They had been fighting in the first place because of Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>“He’s over there!”</p>
<p>“Master!”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Rage guild members looks for Tyrant. He was detected on their battlesuits’ search function, buried under the wreckage outside of the crater.</p>
<p>A group numbering a little over 1 raid went to Tyrant. They entered as a full core of 10,000 people, but about 1/10 is left now. Some of them are still in Ant Hell, but there’s maybe 1,500 people in total. It is a devastating blow in terms of numerical value.</p>
<p>Tyrant gets up, supported by his subordinates.</p>
<p>He is only wearing impact tights. He has taken his battlesuit off somewhere, and is bare bodied.</p>
<p>“What about the mu-mutants?”</p>
<p>“They must have been frightened by the explosion ground, because they ran away.”</p>
<p>“Then what about him?”</p>
<p>“Him?”</p>
<p>“Black Devil! Where’s Black Devil? The mutant points haven’t come in! I’m sure he’s alive! They didn’t run away because of the explosion. They felt his oncoming defeat!”</p>
<p>Tyrant interpreted the situation to his liking.</p>
<p>He is saying that the 9 Bijous ran away because there is a problem with Black Devil.</p>
<p>There are no odds.</p>
<p>He’s saying that he’ll cling to his life.</p>
<p>If Black Devil had been wounded, this is the chance to kill him. The damage to Rage guild is tremendous, but they still have fight left in them.</p>
<p>‘… He spoke. It was Korean.’</p>
<p>Right before the light bomb exploded, the language that went through the translator was Korean. He had been left in wonder because he hadn’t been able to stop the explosion.</p>
<p>Tyrant stumbles in dizziness.</p>
<p>He’s lost too much blood. He lost his right arm too. This is why he can’t stand up on his own.</p>
<p>His hair stands on end when he thinks about what just happened.</p>
<p>He had resorted to extreme measures in order to kill Black Devil and get out of this play.</p>
<p>When the light bomb exploded, the first thing to melt was the right arm that he was holding. He had injected 80% energy and the heat generated from this formidable energy completely melted his right arm and battlesuit part away.</p>
<p>At his helper’s warning, he activated his defensive series items and battlesuit’s energy barrier, and several overlapping barriers protected Tyrant.</p>
<p>All of that was destroyed at once.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Tyrant had been able to buy a fraction of a second’s time to eject himself from his battlesuit. Due to this, Tyrant got out of this range faster than the heat spread. He had survived with having only lost an arm.</p>
<p>“Take out the battlesuit.”</p>
<p>Tyrant speaks to his helper.</p>
<p>When he was ejected, his PDA and space compression bag were also ejected. There’s no reason to take his item out himself.</p>
<p>He can take out the items he wants by just giving an order.</p>
<p>Tyrant received treatment from medics and put on the battlesuit.</p>
<p>It is an extra level A.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have either of his arms, but he can manipulate arms manually.</p>
<p>Several needles come out inside the battlesuit and go into Tyrant. It is like a nutritional injection that stimulates vitality.</p>
<p>‘My level S battlesuit’s destruction is devastating, but I’ll advance once I kill him.’</p>
<p>The last leg.</p>
<p>It all ends once he kills Black Devil.</p>
<p>If he fails the mission, his use of the card becomes meaningless. He’ll just become a level A Lifer like before.</p>
<p>“Search everything!”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Excluding the few forces protecting Tyrant, the 1 raid spread out in forces. They looked for traces of Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>‘Come out. Come out!’</p>
<p>The dark tent that had trapped him was Black Devil. He had set fire to the entire thing. Mutant points would have come in if he had died.</p>
<p>But he’ll be alive since those points didn’t come in, and he must be somewhere close by.</p>
<p>He’ll never be able to get away from the guild members’ search network.</p>
<p>“Ack!”</p>
<p>A ripping scream. Tyrant and the leftover forces next to him had been watching from one place when they looked to where they heard the scream come from.</p>
<p>Ack!</p>
<p>Kya!</p>
<p>They hear successive screams. It isn’t coming from just one or two people scattered here and there. They went around in force numbers. It seems they are getting attacked in groups.</p>
<p>“Over there! Let’s go!”</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Tyrant ran toward the noise.</p>
<p>His heart beats fast.</p>
<p>Because he’s scared?</p>
<p>It is excitement that he could become a true level S Lifer. He doesn’t care whether people die as long as he can complete the mission. Even while injured, he can understand the guild members dying when thinking of the level.</p>
<p>He can think of this as the last struggle. This is the end.</p>
<p>Completion.</p>
<p>Tyrant arrived at the location of the screams with his big dream.</p>
<p>And as soon as soon as the Rage guild members saw ‘it,’ their bodies stiffened.</p>
<p>It didn’t take a long time. It only took moments for their heartbeats that were like excitement to become fear, and for that fear to become hair-raising horror.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 245</p>
<p>‘What happened…’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung feels weird. He can’t really explain it, but it feels like he’s floating in the air. Is this what it feels like to do the drugs he sees on TV?</p>
<p>He remembers the situation.</p>
<p>That damned Tyrant had used an attack similar to self-destruction and the dark tent he had cast while wary of being exposed, had evaporated.</p>
<p>Of course Cha Jun Sung, who had been the dark tent’s subject, was swept into the aftermath.</p>
<p>His major organs had been blown away. It can’t even be described as a serious injury. This is the most danger he has ever been in.</p>
<p>He can’t get in contact with Odin either. His strong level 8 body is gone too. It doesn’t make sense for the PDA to withstand that explosion with its durability.</p>
<p>He must not have died though, since he has retained his self. It’s ambiguous as to whether he is alive or dead. He can’t move his arms and legs.</p>
<p>His arms and legs are just a short description. To go into more detail, he can’t feel his nerve cells.</p>
<p>He is taken aback because this is the first time this has happened.</p>
<p>His senses are numb. He can’t see or smell. He can’t hear or speak.</p>
<p>What is he supposed to do from now on?</p>
<p>Even so.</p>
<p>‘I still have my sense of touch.’</p>
<p>He can feel that he is sitting on the hard ground. It seems he is slumped somewhere.</p>
<p>‘I’m in trouble.’</p>
<p>He is nervous.</p>
<p>If Tyrant is alive and there are still Rage guild members, it isn’t good to continue this state. It is inevitable that they will come looking for him.</p>
<p>His wounds might heal if time passes.</p>
<p>Mutants are different from humans. There are differences with levels, but ultra high levels like Cha Jun Sung live unless the wound is definitely fatal.</p>
<p>Even if his insides get twisted and his arms, legs, and upper body get separated. If there is even a 0.1% possibility that he can live, he won’t die. That is a mutant.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung can think now. He can say that he’s alive.</p>
<p>‘I’m helpless.’</p>
<p>Severe hunger comes swarming in.</p>
<p>This doesn’t mean ‘I’m hungry.’ It is a small reason, but the big reason is that he is out of strength.</p>
<p>He needs to refuel his strength. He’ll do whatever if he can fill it. His whole body feels sluggish. He feels like he is going to fall asleep.</p>
<p>But he can’t go to sleep. His instincts are telling him that means instant death.</p>
<p>‘I’m standing on the edge.’</p>
<p>Life and death – he has a foot in both realms.</p>
<p>The choice is the former.</p>
<p>He’ll die at some point, and there will come a time when he accepts that death fully, but it isn’t this moment.</p>
<p>He feels a pain like a skewer is stabbing at his body. But the feeling that he might die is more serious than that pain.</p>
<p>‘Did – did I lose?’</p>
<p>Right now, Cha Jun Sung might as well be a living piece of meat.</p>
<p>He is unprotected right now, and he can’t attack or act in defense.</p>
<p>‘It’s unfair. I need to live. You guys dragged me into this battlefield.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s feelings rumble like a wave.</p>
<p>It is a craving about life and a hatred for everything that made him this way.</p>
<p>[Give control over your body to me. I’m no longer dependent on you.]</p>
<p>‘Oriax?’</p>
<p>How long has it been since he’s spoken with the Oriax? It seems it has crawled out because his death has come, but the reality is that it has done a thorough calculation.</p>
<p>His body disintegrated.</p>
<p>Because of that, Cha Jun Sung’s mental state is in confusion as well. If the Oriax doesn’t take away control now, he doesn’t think that he’ll be able to do it again.</p>
<p>‘You asshole…’</p>
<p>When Oriax revealed its true feelings, its thoughts were shared with Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>He is angry.</p>
<p>They are all enemies. Subordination? When the Oriax forcibly invaded his body in the Public Underground?</p>
<p>Nonsense!</p>
<p>The Oriax is a gate crasher. It brought this upon itself.</p>
<p>He chose symbiosis because there was no other option, but there really had been no other choice.</p>
<p>It had been the Oriax’s instinctive struggle to stay alive, but everything has an ulterior motive if his death is at the foundation.</p>
<p>‘I’m going to kill everything that is trying to kill me!’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung flailed. All he thought of was survival.</p>
<p>It felt like something was opening up. Unlike before, Cha Jun Sung felt like something attacked him, and he was gaining a tremendous amount of energy from whatever attacked him.</p>
<p>‘I’ll eat all of them up, mutants and humans all. As long as I can live!’</p>
<p>The enemy’s attack becomes more intense. The Oriax’s mental attack continued as well. He returned the attacks as much as he was attacked from inside and outside. He is struggling to stay alive.</p>
<p>‘I need more powerful strength.’</p>
<p>It is often said that you can achieve something if you desperately want it.</p>
<p>It’s because you have that much qualification. Opportunities come to those who have the qualification.</p>
<p>Waiting for luck without doing anything is just greed.</p>
<p>‘I can get stronger.’</p>
<p>Black Lord – this is him in another world.</p>
<p>If they are the same and they have the same qualifications, he wants to become like him.</p>
<p>He wants to… become complete.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Uh uh…”</p>
<p>“Monster!”</p>
<p>The Rage guild members took steps backwards from the devastation in front of them.</p>
<p>Tyrant gulped.</p>
<p>He is getting bigger and bigger. The black lump that had been the size of a human head in the beginning, had become bigger than a truck.</p>
<p>Dozens of tentacles come out of the black lump and skewer the Rage guild members. Then it absorbs each of them. All that comes back out of the lump are machines like battlesuits and equipment.</p>
<p>“Kill it! It’s trying to recover its strength and resurrect itself!”</p>
<p>Tyrant knows by intuition that they are looking at Black Devil’s nucleus.</p>
<p>There are mutants like that. Those that can resurrect as long as they have their nucleus even if their bodies have been blasted away. There are very few among the ultra high levels.</p>
<p>“Attack!”</p>
<p>Tyrant throws light bombs like crazy.</p>
<p>His battlesuit performance deteriorated so its power isn’t even half of what it was before, but he attacked however he could.</p>
<p>The Rage guild members followed him and used all of their power on the black lump.</p>
<p>Attacks other than bombs and bullets went at the black lump’s coat, but they were unable to get through and just floated around outside. It is an incredible defense.</p>
<p>“Get back!”</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Tyrant injected as much energy from the level A battlesuit as he could into a light bomb.</p>
<p>He is trying to deliver one big blow rather than taking small hits. Before a light bomb with maximum output could leave Tyrant’s hand, the black lump must have some kind of thought because it didn’t just stand by and watch his actions.</p>
<p>Spat!</p>
<p>A sharp tentacle cut Tyrant’s wrist in a wink. His arm had already been cut off, so there is just empty space inside the battlesuit part.</p>
<p>He didn’t have time to react. If he doesn’t have arms, he can’t use light bombs. The energy doesn’t get delivered properly. Tyrant tried to do it with his other hand, but the black lump’s transformation came first.</p>
<p>The black lump gradually took shape. It is cloistering to go back to the form it originally had.</p>
<p>“I’m… complete.”</p>
<p>Kung!</p>
<p>A moment passed. The black lump took total form.</p>
<p>It is similar to the level 8 Black Devil that Tyrant saw, but there were three pairs of arms and heads with faces on the top, bottom, and sides.</p>
<p>It looked like an incarnation of Asura, the battling demon of Buddhism.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung became a level 9 with complete awakening in his final evolution.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>“Ah ah! Don’t come!”</p>
<p>Tyrant took steps backwards getting chased by something, and falls on his butt. His level A battlesuit becomes a rag. It is so ruined that it can’t function.</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>A mutant with overwhelming magnificence appears in front of Tyrant. It is Cha Jun Sung, who has become complete, superior to all other existence. He has three pairs of arms, and red blood flows down his six arms. The blood is from the six Lifers that he is holding in his hands.</p>
<p>The corpses ripped apart behind Cha Jun Sung form a line. He chased Rage guild members running away and killed them sequentially.</p>
<p>There is a saying that describes the horrors of war as people’s bodies piling up like a mountain and blood flowing like an ocean. That is the situation that happened in front of Tyrant recently. All that was left of the Black Devil was the nucleus, but it resurrected in less than 30 minutes.</p>
<p>Though they had been injured, an entire raid had been wiped out. Not a single person had survived. Except Tyrant.</p>
<p>“Did they all run away?”</p>
<p>The dull voice is monotonous. Emotionless as though a machine were speaking. It is creepy and scary.</p>
<p>Tyrant thought he was dreaming. He had realized he wouldn’t be able to complete the mission when about 3 forces died.</p>
<p>4 forces, 400 people had been killed, but they hadn’t been able to leave even a scratch. On top of that, it had been layered into a special mission. This is it. Special mission – the culprit that’ll force Tyrant to quit.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 246</p>
<p>[Level S Mission: Asura’s Birth] [Goal: Attainment]</p>
<p>[Description: Black Devil attacked Evil Queen’s daughters and seized the opportunity to take over North America. Driven to an extreme situation of life-or-death, he transcended the limits of his species and succeeded in final evolution. Black Devil killed Cruel King to take over the empty Disaster spot, becoming the nucleus of the storm and shaking up the structure of existing Disasters for many years to come. The only thing that is somewhat questionable is that Black Devil, who has gone through final evolution, is similar to Asia’s Disaster, Black Lord. Nothing has been revealed. Lifers. Test the limits. Kill the Disaster and close the curtain on Life Mission.] [Reward: 100,000,000,000 points, dream box.]</p>
<p>At that moment, a challenge itself is impossible. Even if World Federation and Bloody Kingdom unite and all Rankers mobilize, they would all be killed.</p>
<p>1,500 people were swept away like dust in 30 minutes. That’s why he abandoned his guild members and ran away. Cha Jun Sung didn’t rush after him.</p>
<p>He followed after him slowly while killing annoying Rage guild members.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung squeezes the six Lifers he is holding in each of his arms. Their battlesuits become scrap metal in the gruesome grip. Blood and organs spout out from between his palms, but there are no screams of pain. They had already been dead when he grabbed them.</p>
<p>Tyrant watched his subordinates pop and vomited. Corpses? He’s seen a lot, but he never imagined that they could look like that.</p>
<p>He hadn’t been able to sympathize until now. Now, he can. The probability that he will become like his subordinates is more than 99.9%.</p>
<p>“How refreshing.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung becomes intoxicated by the incredible strength he gives off. He realized after he evolved. Level 9 in reality is different from level 9 in the virtual. Level 9-s can’t be taken on with one or two fully armed level S Lifers. Would a party – 10 people – be enough? Cha Jun Sung tried calculating the odds based on himself.</p>
<p>‘It would be a loss.’</p>
<p>10 people might be too much, but 5 or 6 people would be possible. The only complete level S Lifer right now is Cha Jun Sung. There are only a couple level A Lifers as well.</p>
<p>With this as a foundation, Lifer would never be able to fight Disasters with current standards. Cha Jun Sung is alone.</p>
<p>Other Disasters? They go around with level 8-s like ornaments.</p>
<p>“Missions are going to get easier from now on.”</p>
<p>It seems like a destruction of balance, but he has no intention of saving this strength. He will kill each level 8, cut the level 9’s hands and feet, and go one-on-one. He cannot be sure, but if he has the same strength that Black Lord has, he won’t lose to anyone other than Black Lord himself, whether it is Evil Queen or Bon Load.</p>
<p>“I’ll put White Queen and Levadan on hold.”</p>
<p>He has no intention of fighting Black Lord. He doesn’t want to. White Queen is his ally and Levadan lives in a tricky environment, the ocean.</p>
<p>First are Evil Queen and Bon Load. Evil Queen is the only goal for now.</p>
<p>Even one is hard, so he isn’t confident that he can take on a level S mission alone. But since he has gained this strength, he will try to kill. If the most potent level A Rankers try to complete a level S mission, they might have to go in for a few years to dozens of years.</p>
<p>They might not even get to face off after that time.</p>
<p>Very few Lifers are going into missions up to level B periodically, but they can’t even imagine level A unless they are the World Federation or Bloody Kingdom.</p>
<p>They are wary of level A too. So level S is overwhelming. Cha Jun Sung is taking over level S alone during that time.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung had left Tyrant and been thinking of something else, when he turned his head. Tyrant hadn’t cleaned his dirty mouth, and he was looking at Cha Jun Sung with fear. His face had a bit of wonder in it.</p>
<p>“Are you curious about something? Tanaka.”</p>
<p>“How – how!”</p>
<p>His battlesuit was destroyed, but his PDA is fine and his translator works.</p>
<p>It’s still a wonder that Black Devil is speaking Korean, but he can just get over this.</p>
<p>Levels 8 and 9 have abilities that are similar to those of humans. The problem is that this mutant spoke his name. A mutant clearly said a Lifer’s name.</p>
<p>How could it know the name of a human from a different world, another dimension?</p>
<p>“Since you need to die anyway. I wanted to tell my secret to someone at least once. Though I didn’t know that you’d be the unlucky one.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s 12m body from head to toe shrinks. He kept shrinking until he became so small he was only about 2m tall.</p>
<p>A few pairs of horns disappeared, and only a pair each of arms and eyes were left. His skin tone went from black to a yellowish white. Human Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>“You’ll know this form of me, right? Murayama Tanaka.”</p>
<p>“Cha – Cha Jun Sung? Overload? What is this! You’re a mutant?”</p>
<p>Tyrant raises his voice in disbelief. The way he speaks grows faster as well. His fear went away for just a moment. That is how shocked he is.</p>
<p>“I was active as a normal Lifer, and then became like this a few years ago. You know the parasitic mutant Oriax, right? That invaded my body and bothered the A virus that’s in our bodies. After I woke up from living in a craze like that for 1 year and 5 months, I had been transformed into a level 8 mutant.”</p>
<p>Had the dam broken? Cha Jun Sung told everything about this secret that he’s never told anyone about before. The amount that the supervisors know.</p>
<p>“You bastard! Are you expecting me to believe that?”</p>
<p>“You’re mistaken.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung went toward Tyrant. He is completely naked, but he didn’t feel anything like embarrassment.</p>
<p>Tyrant’s surprise attack? He won’t even have the energy to do it, but it doesn’t matter even if he does. He is a semi-immortal being, and he won’t die even if his neck is cut off or his brain and heart burst.</p>
<p>He put his face forward. He looked at Tyrant from a distance so close he can feel his breath on him. He looks like a human, but there is a ferocity in his eyes.</p>
<p>“Believing or not is up to you. There’s no reason for me to convince you. I just told you because I’ve been itching to say it.”</p>
<p>“Then all of this was your trick? This whole mission.”</p>
<p>“I guess I didn’t tell you that.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung held his stomach and laughed, and then told Tyrant all about the supervisors, helpers, and how this situation had come about.</p>
<p>“How could this…”</p>
<p>Tyrant was devastated by the fact that he was just a knight on a chess board.</p>
<p>To summarize, he was chosen randomly for this mission as Jigneon’s punishment for Borteth’s improper intervention.</p>
<p>“Borteth will try to eat me alive if this goes wrong, but I’m not scared. I hope he appears in front of me. So I can rip him into pieces.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung cursed Borteth and transformed his left hand into a sharp sword. Since their conversation is nearly over, he is going to kill Tyrant.</p>
<p>“To be frank, you have no fault in this. We’re just not on good terms, but we haven’t done enough to each other to want to kill the other.”</p>
<p>Having a bad relationship in the virtual version doesn’t warrant a death sentence. He knows that Tyrant is bad in the virtual and reality version, but that’s just that. He hasn’t really done much wrong to Cha Jun Sung. If there had been anything, it is that he threw a white phosphorus shell during the battle between their federations. That could be his sin since Cha Jun Sung almost died then.</p>
<p>“Save – Save me! I’ll do whatever you want! Like you said, I was used too!”</p>
<p>“You’re right. But I can’t let you live. That’s the goal of the mission. If I let you live, the supervisors will look at me in a bad light and that’s just trouble.”</p>
<p>“Ri – right! You don’t like Bloody Kingdom, right? I’ll give you information on Bloody Kingdom. Money too! Trillions! Anything! Please!”</p>
<p>“I don’t need it. Tell them to live the way they live. Farewell, Tyrant.”</p>
<p>The blade cuts Tyrant’s neck. Blood spurts out like a fountain. It’s the end. He has gone through 10 stages of body modifications, but humans cannot survive after having their necks cut even if they went through 30 or 40 stages.</p>
<p>“How boring.”</p>
<p>Maybe it is because he has become level 9, but the course felt hollow. Though he had used the opening card, he had been a level S Lifer and killing him had been as easy as popping a cap off a bottle.</p>
<p>It could have been easier because Tyrant had sustained injuries from the continuous battles. But even if he had been in perfect state, it would have been over in 20 minutes.</p>
<p>“So I resurrected from my nucleus.”</p>
<p>His organs including his brain and heart had been blasted away by the light bomb explosion.</p>
<p>There are very few among ultra high levels that are able to resurrect from their nuclei. They are basically going around with extra lives. Beholder loses his memory if he resurrects from his nucleus. But this hadn’t happened to Cha Jun Sung. It’s proof that he is superior to Beholder.</p>
<p>Also, there’s no way to know whether even mutants with nuclei that can bring on resurrection are able to do so with just the nuclei left over. There’s no way to test it either since they would just die if they don’t have that ability. If there hadn’t been a big danger for Black Lord, he wouldn’t have known about his state either.</p>
<p>It is a strange feeling to know something that Black Lord doesn’t know when he thought that Black Lord was superior to him in every way.</p>
<p>He will have to let Black Lord know later if they have the chance to meet again. There has to be give and take. He might get useful information.</p>
<p>“I should get back first.”</p>
<p>He needs to go back to the city with Ant Hell since his PDA evaporated. The PDA he normally used is in the space compression bag that he left there.</p>
<p>Things will get complicated from now on, but he can just resolve everything step by step. Nothing stands out in the face of overwhelming force.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 247</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant’s body split in half in a vertical solid line in front of him. Cha Jun Sung can be seen in between the two halves.</p>
<p>“Arrogant bitch.”</p>
<p>To rebel against a king, one must hide their intentions until they have the means to bring on action. That is how they can take a hit.</p>
<p>Queen Bomb Ant is the worst in that aspect.</p>
<p>She complained multiple times to a predator who is much stronger than she is.</p>
<p>If she had just obeyed him, he would have helped her maintain her power, but it was too late.</p>
<p>He killed her himself just as he had decided he would.</p>
<p>Boom boom boom!</p>
<p>The Queen Bomb Ant is the Bomb Ants’ matrix.</p>
<p>When this constancy was cut off, the surviving Bomb Ants from Ant Hell all committed suicide.</p>
<p>The flying Bomb Ants had been annihilated and there had been thousands of ground-based ones, but not a single one stayed alive. It is true annihilation.</p>
<p>The Rage guild and Bomb Ants are all dead.</p>
<p>There is only Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took clothing and his PDA out of the space compression bag he had left hidden. He left the battlesuit.</p>
<p>Mission complete.</p>
<p>He doesn’t need it.</p>
<p>Beep beep!</p>
<p>All he did was put it on his wrist, but the PDA turned on.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung wasn’t even surprised. He had moved deliberately. Tracking him wouldn’t have been hard.</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>As soon as the PDA turned on, a large hologram came up as a turning 3D model of a single mutant.</p>
<p>A description of the mutant is next to the figure.</p>
<p>The mutant’s name is Black Lord.</p>
<p>It is written in Korean for Cha Jun Sung, and it contains everything that Life Mission has investigated until now.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>Another hologram comes up.</p>
<p>The subject is Cha Jun Sung. It is as though the two are meant to be compared.</p>
<p>[What happened?]</p>
<p>It isn’t hard to respond to Odin’s question.</p>
<p>So he answered.</p>
<p>“The same person.”</p>
<p>[… Are you saying Black Lord and Lifer Cha Jun Sung are?]</p>
<p>“Aren’t you guys the ones who connected the two worlds through Life Mission? There’s a slight time difference, but of course they’re the same people.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung speaks bluntly.</p>
<p>Odin knows what he’s saying, but he hadn’t imagined this would be the extent. There are only six.</p>
<p>That number exceeded limits among every living thing on the planet.</p>
<p>A virus was first spread in the world inside the mission. They spread it in a gap in dimensions, so it was impossible for people of the times to identify the cause.</p>
<p>It was random.</p>
<p>They hadn’t been able to discriminate between who became a mutant and how they were evolving. It’s because they can’t investigate each person. They had started to get a handle over the system when the mutant food chain became configured.</p>
<p>Until then, they had only observed.</p>
<p>They opened another dimension after with the game’s frame as the reality version, a training center where Lifers could become educated on Life Mission.</p>
<p>It was on a registered account basis, so they were able to distinguish those who are talented.</p>
<p>They hadn’t suspected that they may be the same people because of this difference.</p>
<p>[Then inside there too?]</p>
<p>“I guess I’d have to say he recognized me? Black Lord recognized me. We talked a little too.”</p>
<p>Odin is referring to the dark tent.</p>
<p>He confessed everything excluding personal matters.</p>
<p>The only thing that the supervisors and helpers don’t know about now, is the 3rd person in their relationship.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung doesn’t know about this issue either.</p>
<p>He left it out because he doesn’t know if they’ll be able to meet or what will happen going forward. They’ll be busy with the fact that he and Black Lord are the same people as it is.</p>
<p>[Lifer Cha Jun Sung, do you know who has evolved to level 9?]</p>
<p>“Other than me?”</p>
<p>[Cruel King, Sea God, and Bon Load can’t know, but White Queen and Evil Queen were humans, so there is one of them in each world.]</p>
<p>It is already in the past. Nothing will happen if he tells.</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I wouldn’t tell you even if I did.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung cut him off bluntly.</p>
<p>He can guarantee 99% that they will drag him off as a subject for experiments. He was a bonus sample unlike the other mutants inside missions.</p>
<p>At this moment, they could choose to be active as a Lifer or to live a normal life. That is their personal lives. He doesn’t want to interfere.</p>
<p>“Or just open another dimension and use me as a sample.”</p>
<p>[We used a tremendous amount of human and material resources in opening just the two.]</p>
<p>[It seems simple when looking at just the results, but the effort to go through that process is unmeasurable.]</p>
<p>“Then just leave it.”</p>
<p>He has no intention of becoming a pawn.</p>
<p>One time is bound to become two times, and two times becomes three.</p>
<p>His business with the supervisors is done as well. He was promised protection from Borteth when he took care of Tyrant. They have each traded one thing.</p>
<p>“I want to go back.”</p>
<p>[Wait. Shall we talk before you go back?]</p>
<p>The voice coming through the PDA is not Odin.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung thought that it was Gabenu. He is the only person who would be talking to him right now.</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>A summons gate opens in front of Cha Jun Sung.</p>
<p>Jigneon and another middle-aged man come out.</p>
<p>The 3rd supervisor, Gabenu.</p>
<p>“How surprising…”</p>
<p>What do they want that they have appeared before him?</p>
<p>He’ll get to see all of the supervisors at this rate. Since there are three of them, he only needs to see Borteth.</p>
<p>“I’ll get to the point. There’s no reason for you to help us with our work, but there’s also no reason for you to get in the way. I’ll ask. Are you a Lifer or a mutant?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung couldn’t answer right away.</p>
<p>If a Lifer’s focus is matched to humans, Cha Jun Sung is not a Lifer. He could be called a mutant.</p>
<p>“I guess I’m a mutant?”</p>
<p>“I guess you could say that.”</p>
<p>“We left you alone because up to level 8 is acceptable, but it becomes completely different when you’re level 9. You can’t go into level S missions.”</p>
<p>This is nonsense.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung is confused. They appeared out of nowhere and are telling him that he can’t go into level S missions. This is unacceptable.</p>
<p>“Do you think it will be possible for a level S Lifer to raid level 9-s?”</p>
<p>“… If it’s a party.”</p>
<p>“Good point. You’re right. It might be possible if it is a party with level S Lifers fully set with 10 stages of body modifications and 10-combination battlesuits. The problem here?”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung didn’t speak.</p>
<p>Gabenu knows what he is trying to say as well. A party of 10 people means 10 level S Lifers.</p>
<p>If the target is just one level 9, five or six people could have enough power. But they have to consider the level 8-s that follow level 9-s.</p>
<p>When Tyrant died, Cha Jun Sung became the only level S Lifer. To become level S, they need to go through level A advancement. They need to complete a mission at the same level as Deep Sea Teeth.</p>
<p>“We calculated it and if the World Federation tries level A advancement, about 2 or 3 people would be able to advance. The problem is that everyone else would die. You know well that going through missions with stronger Lifers doesn’t guarantee advancement.”</p>
<p>He knows.</p>
<p>Even if he tries to help others advance after he advanced from World Federation, it doesn’t work. It ends up being that he advanced, so he acts on his own.</p>
<p>There are about 30 level A Lifers in the world.</p>
<p>Of those, a few need to wait until level Bs grow. How long will that take?</p>
<p>“What if you enter level S in this situation? You’ll probably complete it. Then what choice will you make to complete it?”</p>
<p>If he can’t complete it with the strength of a Lifer, he will use his strength as a level 9 mutant. His identity has already been exposed. There’s no reason to hide it.</p>
<p>“Completing a mission with mutant strength? We’re testing Lifers and mutants to see who is superior. We don’t want there to be in-species fighting. There’s nothing we can do if it occurs naturally, but we can’t accept it if it comes artificially.”</p>
<p>It doesn’t matter if he doesn’t use his mutant strength, but they are saying that he can’t use it. If he does, he can’t go into level S missions.</p>
<p>It is too hard to do alone.</p>
<p>He needs to either wait until other Lifers advance, or go into level A missions with his battlesuit.</p>
<p>“We’ll sanction you if you try to take shortcuts and go into lower levels to get special missions. We’ll do whatever it takes, whether it is intervention.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s face convulsed and his eyes became dark red. It is as though they turned into glass marbles.</p>
<p>“Whatever it takes?”</p>
<p>“I overreacted. I’ll apologize. That’s how important this matter is. Anyway, we’ll limit the level 9 strength you use inside missions.”</p>
<p>To the supervisors, Cha Jun Sung is something strange that came out of nowhere.</p>
<p>They can’t control it and they don’t have the authority to do so.</p>
<p>If they want Life Mission to run properly, they can’t let him go around in missions as a mutant with strong and transcendent power.</p>
<p>“Now you say that?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by that?”</p>
<p>“Whose fault is this that I’ve become like this? Who created Life Mission? You created this mess and now you’re saying you’re going to kick me out?”</p>
<p>The clothes he just put on begins to rip. He hadn’t been able to suppress his swelling power. The floor becomes dented under his incredible weight.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s aura is so murderous that even level 8-s would whimper in fear, but Gabenu looked unconcerned.</p>
<p>“Well this.”</p>
<p>It seems that their honest thoughts had touched on the feelings that Cha Jun Sung had been suppressing. It is possible for him to see this as a provocation.</p>
<p>“You want me to quit after all of this?”</p>
<p>9 eyes look over Gabenu.</p>
<p>He has no intention of killing Gabenu. He just needs to take back what he said. All he needs to do is give him his pride.</p>
<p>“We did create Life Mission. The operators are saying that they will block an account because of a bug. Isn’t it weird to argue that?”</p>
<p>Gabenu countered him with his own logic.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung felt it.</p>
<p>An argument won’t end this. Gabenu shows no signs of yielding.</p>
<p>“You said that you would do whatever it takes if I don’t listen, right?”</p>
<p>“Right.”</p>
<p>“Then try it.”</p>
<p>He is accepting.</p>
<p>He won’t use level 9 strength inside missions.</p>
<p>“Jigneon could probably beat you, but the probability is 50/50 in my case, so it’s fair. Since we each have our own thoughts.”</p>
<p>Gabenu relaxes his backward stance.</p>
<p>The opponent is a Lifer and level 9 mutant. He has a completely different combat ark from existing mutants.</p>
<p>“Did you know? Apparently, your name is Asura. Isn’t it cool? I came up with it.”</p>
<p>Supervisors manage levels S and A missions instead of helpers. Gabenu has authority because Jigneon and Borteth can’t be reached.</p>
<p>“I chose Asura because of your appearance… but also because I expected this situation. That you would go against us if I tried to bring sanctions.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung could kind of understand what he was saying, but there were also things he couldn’t.</p>
<p>“For this moment at least… I’ll become the Sakra that can overpower Asura.”</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 248</p>
<p>Black smoke comes out.</p>
<p>A dark demon walks out from among blazing red flames. There are hideous scars all over its body.</p>
<p>Regeneration is slow.</p>
<p>It is because he consumed a lot of energy during his battle with Gabenu. The black smoke will disappear soon as well.</p>
<p>“How annoying. What is that?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you? It’s a battlesuit that transcends even level S.”</p>
<p>Vroom.</p>
<p>Gabenu spoke while floating in the air.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s 9 eyes glare at him. It looks similar to a battlesuit.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung can see the particles in nanometer that continuously move. It changed its appearance freely. Cha Jun Sung is a whole body mutation mutant, but there is a frame that he can work within.</p>
<p>Even as a master of transformation, he can’t become something like a coin.</p>
<p>But the Miracle can transform into anything. Anything.</p>
<p>While fighting, the mass became a huge shield or a sword.</p>
<p>It was released from Gabenu when that happened, but it fought like a level 8 even without a passenger. The crazier thing is that it operated separately.</p>
<p>If he attacked it, the Miracle scattered like smoke.</p>
<p>It was like fighting a ghost.</p>
<p>He had to focus and attack to feel the impact of the strike. It isn’t safe for Gabenu to stay unarmed when he isn’t in the Miracle.</p>
<p>At some point, he took out a level S battlesuit and attacked with that. He is basically wearing two layers of battlesuits. There isn’t a difference in combat power, but there’s no way to make sense of it. He keeps changing between one-to-one and two-to-one.</p>
<p>He is playing with Cha Jun Sung’s mind so he can’t focus on a single one.</p>
<p>There is significant psychological pressure.</p>
<p>‘There’s almost no effect from cutting or stabbing him.’</p>
<p>He avoided easily because the attack area is small.</p>
<p>When he tried to go through the stomach, a hole would form on just the stomach. Or when he tried to cut, that part would split on its own.</p>
<p>In that moment of surprise, Gabenu would follow up without fail. What would happen if Miracle got in the hands of Lifers beyond level A?</p>
<p>Lifers below level 8 wouldn’t even be able to face it.</p>
<p>Missions would become easy.</p>
<p>It is just that that cannot happen.</p>
<p>There are only two Miracles, which are owned by Jigneon and Gabenu. They can create it, but it had the worst production difficulty even with their scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>So they can’t even dream of creating a supply.</p>
<p>There also aren’t people who can use it, so they would just remain as ornaments.</p>
<p>Papapat!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung disappeared.</p>
<p>Gabenu used the Miracle to create a primary barrier, and waited. He didn’t move rashly. It is a one-on-one fight.</p>
<p>Ignore minor attacks.</p>
<p>The win depends on who takes the first real blow.</p>
<p>It should be decided around now. Cha Jun Sung and Gabenu are both at less than half of their attack power.</p>
<p>There are signs of attack from back and front, left and right from near Gabenu. A black shadow comes at him on the ground and in the air.</p>
<p>The Miracle stops attacking.</p>
<p>It is more precise to say that he held onto it.</p>
<p>“The real one is this side.”</p>
<p>Boom!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung’s hand grew like a fly swatter. He has expanded the area because the Miracle keeps scattering like a ghost.</p>
<p>“I thought a secondary attack would come. I had been waiting for it.”</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>The Miracle clustered in one place and collided with Cha Jun Sung’s palm.</p>
<p>There was no push.</p>
<p>Strength gets compacted as much as the mass does.</p>
<p>It was a fail.</p>
<p>‘I’m going crazy.’</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung has more offense power, but Gabenu and the Miracle was superior in defense.</p>
<p>Moreover, he is a supervisor.</p>
<p>If he decides to really get into it, Cha Jun Sung won’t be able to handle it.</p>
<p>Who knew he would use an item that Lifers don’t get? The Miracle alone was taking all of Cha Jun Sung’s attention.</p>
<p>‘Does it have to get murderous?’</p>
<p>They aren’t joking around in the battle. They are fighting with sincerity. It’s just that they were fighting with intent to win, to knock the other out rather than to kill. It is more like a spar.</p>
<p>They both think differently, but they become united with one goal.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung feels killing Gabenu as a burden.</p>
<p>He is one of the supervisors who created Life Mission. This is enough of a reason.</p>
<p>This is the same for Gabenu.</p>
<p>He did mean to coerce Cha Jun Sung, as he is important data in the experiment. There is unlimited opportunity for him to bring them good results.</p>
<p>They both worried about the after effects of killing the other. They were considering the disadvantages as they fought.</p>
<p>‘If he really thinks that the probability in this fight is 50%, he’ll have a method if I give it my all. I can’t hold back. Let’s go at it.’</p>
<p>9 fronts, 36 eyes looking east and west sink coldly and the emanating atmosphere changes.</p>
<p>Gabenu noticed this.</p>
<p>“Seems you have no intention of giving in.”</p>
<p>“Of course not.”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>Gabenu put the Miracle in full activation as well.</p>
<p>If the fight until now had been to land one blow to injure the opponent, it was now to land one blow to kill.</p>
<p>It was right when they had finished changing states and were about to go into a ferocious battle.</p>
<p>Gabenu suddenly stopped moving.</p>
<p>An unexpected report came in.</p>
<p>[Evil Queen was coming back from South America when she was attacked.]</p>
<p>[The opponent seems to be the unidentified Lifer who is currently under special management, but he still doesn’t get picked up on satellite.]</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>For something to happen while he happened to be away from his position. It is troubling, but he remained calm and didn’t show it.</p>
<p>“The situation?”</p>
<p>[Evil Queen is getting pushed back. Something must have happened in South America because she lost her strength. We expect that she has 50 to 60% of her normal strength.]</p>
<p>Life Mission has been tracking an unidentified Lifer, but they kept failing because he has the ability to neutralize satellites.</p>
<p>All they were able to do was arrive too late after he killed a level 8 and hid. They hadn’t been able to do anything because the battle ended so quickly.</p>
<p>But it’s Evil Queen this time.</p>
<p>She’s a level 9.</p>
<p>She’s a mutant that is fully capable of hanging onto him. Gabenu needs to go catch him immediately.</p>
<p>He seems to be a Lifer, but he is unregistered.</p>
<p>They can’t understand it.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung has no way of knowing about Gabenu’s situation, and he puts power into his body. He compresses like a spring. When he was about to eject that power, Gabenu held up his hand.</p>
<p>“Let’s stop. I have something more urgent to do than fight with you.”</p>
<p>“Who says?”</p>
<p>“I guess that could have been really one-sided. At least I let you know, right?”</p>
<p>It is resolved easily if he recalls Cha Jun Sung’s PDA with his authority as a supervisor.</p>
<p>He personally explained out of courtesy.</p>
<p>“We were able to fight because it was me. If it were Jigneon, it would have been hard for you even if you are another Black Lord.”</p>
<p>Gabenu said it in a roundabout way, but Cha Jun Sung understood. If they were to act as they please, there are many ways in which they can do it.</p>
<p>“Once Jigneon returns, we’ll discuss and let you know.”</p>
<p>“You’re telling me to wait quietly for your decision?”</p>
<p>“I can’t deny it.”</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>They can’t fight anymore.</p>
<p>Gabenu recalls his Miracle. He’s wearing a battlesuit, so it doesn’t become the form of clothing but covered the battlesuit.</p>
<p>“Rest for now.”</p>
<p>A gate opens up next to Gabenu as it did when he first arrived.</p>
<p>It isn’t a gate to take him back to the world he lives in. It will take him directly to where Evil Queen is in battle.</p>
<p>Gabenu looked over Cha Jun Sung and laughed meaningfully before he disappeared.</p>
<p>“Damn it.”</p>
<p>Bang!</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung smashes a wall with his fist.</p>
<p>He’s pissed.</p>
<p>As Gabenu said, there are many ways for them to suppress him. He fought out of obstinacy and pride, but the status quo doesn’t change.</p>
<p>He completed the mission and there are no more risk factors.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung releases his awakened state and looks up at the sky. It is dark as if dyed with black ink. It felt like he was looking at his future.</p>
<p>He sighed.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung got his PDA and space compression bag again, looked down at his palm, and took out the remaining matter from his body.</p>
<p>He forgot because of everything that had happened. There is something he needs to take care of before going back to reality.</p>
<p>A black liquid comes out of Cha Jun Sung’s hand. It writhed like it was alive, and then fell to the floor.</p>
<p>“Go. You’re a disgrace, but you were just trying to live too.”</p>
<p>The black liquid is the Oriax.</p>
<p>When Cha Jun Sung became a level 9, he gained the ability to control every single cell.</p>
<p>And he knew.</p>
<p>The Oriax was being eaten up by him just as the Oriax had thought.</p>
<p>It is a definite for a living being to struggle to survive.</p>
<p>He is letting the Oriax go because he is considering the normality of it.</p>
<p>The Oriax wanted to gain level 9 strength, but also just purely wanted to live.</p>
<p>Of the two, its will to stay alive was greater.</p>
<p>He will let it live since there is some kind of attachment even if it is negative. With level 7 strength, it will be able to go and live somewhere.</p>
<p>After the Oriax was released from Cha Jun Sung, it hesitated for a moment before disappearing. When the Oriax left, it was left with only fragmentary memories.</p>
<p>It isn’t good to know a lot about the world of Life Mission. It is better to forget the unnecessary things because it will go on to live as a mutant.</p>
<p>“I should get going too.”</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung goes back.</p>
<p>He really doesn’t know what will happen to him from now on.</p>
<p>What will be the end?</p>
<p>He just hopes that it will be be settled smoothly.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 249</p>
<p>Woong!</p>
<p>After Gabenu quit his battle with Cha Jun Sung, he arrived in the region where Evil Queen is.</p>
<p>It is a level of technology that also allows for movement between dimensions. Teleportation, which is just moving distance, is extremely easy.</p>
<p>“Unbelievable.”</p>
<p>Gabenu’s expression was not bright when he arrived at his destination. It is full of dissatisfaction and surprise. It is as he said, unbelievable.</p>
<p>“It was just for a moment, but I was trapped between dimensions.”</p>
<p>About 1 to 2 seconds, the time it takes to blink a few times?</p>
<p>That was all it was.</p>
<p>Gabenu had been trapped while leaping through distance for that short time.</p>
<p>It had just been 1 to 2 seconds inside, but half a day had passed outside. The temporal gap between the inside and outside had caused this difference.</p>
<p>“He’s run away.”</p>
<p>There are traces of the battle everywhere, but there is no hint of him.</p>
<p>It wasn’t just a couple hours, but half a day.</p>
<p>It is often said that the powerful fight for days, but this has no credibility to it.</p>
<p>It normally turns out that the weak drag on their battles and the powerful end them quickly. Every single attack is fatal.</p>
<p>A body and soul are separated within moments.</p>
<p>Gabenu released his Miracle.</p>
<p>The Miracle, composed of millions of bead-like particles, clustered into dozens, and scattered.</p>
<p>Though it boasts perfect performance, it cannot act to its full potential if it is divided too much.</p>
<p>The Miracle is more real when united than when it is scattered. That is the perfect number when taking into consideration that a battle can happen anywhere, at any time.</p>
<p>Each has the power of level 7.</p>
<p>“Hm.”</p>
<p>Information from the Miracle enters Gabenu’s battlesuit. There are traces everywhere. The destruction range is incredible because they moved as they fought. It was a match for his and Cha Jun Sung’s battle.</p>
<p>But there was nothing related to that unidentified Lifer. Everything had been incinerated. Half a day is plenty of time to do that.</p>
<p>[Evil Queen discovered.]</p>
<p>Papat!</p>
<p>Gabenu went to the location of the Miracle that had sent the discovery signal.</p>
<p>There, he found Evil Queen, dead in her awakened state.</p>
<p>Scars all over her body. At this rate, there’s no way her opponent is safe.</p>
<p>“Move her to my lab.”</p>
<p>[Yes.]</p>
<p>The divided Miracles come together.</p>
<p>The Miracle puts Evil Queen’s corpse into a summons gate. He needs to find the cause of death.</p>
<p>“There are too many unintended variables.”</p>
<p>The overall frame of the systems are the same, but reality is clearly different.</p>
<p>It can’t be controlled the way they want.</p>
<p>The unidentified Lifer and Cha Jun Sung who has become level 9. Africa’s cocoon and Evil Queen’s suspicious death.</p>
<p>Even Borteth added his name to these variables.</p>
<p>Everything had been fun except him, but he also provided strength.</p>
<p>[Gabenu.]</p>
<p>“What now?”</p>
<p>[Africa’s cocoon is showing signs of waking up. It seems it will only take a few weeks. Mutants have begun to move busily.]</p>
<p>Gabenu holds his forehead. These bothersome events are happening all at the same time.</p>
<p>This mysterious test subject is welcome to a scientist, but it also isn’t good if it is overwhelming.</p>
<p>He hopes it will be sequential.</p>
<p>“Open the door. We’ll be on watch 24 hours from now on.”</p>
<p>It is complicated, but he can’t stop what has already begun.</p>
<p>If they stop the flow, it will go against the effects of Life Mission.</p>
<p>All they need to do is watch the process and accomplish results.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Gabenu returns.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung knows he is no longer being watched, and walks out. He had been hiding in a corner of a high-rise building.</p>
<p>He was a mess.</p>
<p>Forget the fact that his battlesuit is now scrap metal. His left arm was cut off, and the wound he can see past the battlesuit is not light.</p>
<p>It wouldn’t be weird for him to pass out now.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung leaned on a wall and collapsed to the ground.</p>
<p>He barely killed Evil Queen, but this is the state he was left in.</p>
<p>He would be able to use medical tools to reattach his arm if it was left, but the bitch shredded it.</p>
<p>The only answer is regeneration.</p>
<p>He needs specialized medicine from the store if he is to regenerate. Or he needs to go to the briefing room or Mechanic City, but he cannot do that.</p>
<p>He didn’t come to the past after careful planning.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have enough items because he was sent here through Borteth’s tricks while he had been trying to return after completing a mission.</p>
<p>“There’s nothing left.”</p>
<p>He is bitter.</p>
<p>The Over Limit, all 20 special cyborgs were destroyed. He used most of his other items too.</p>
<p>All he has left are a few things he can use permanently and materials to repair his battlesuit.</p>
<p>“If I could get in contact with Lifers…”</p>
<p>He hesitates to reach out in this situation. He can’t leave a long trail. Even now, Gabenu would have found him if they had miscalculated the time.</p>
<p>[You are losing too much blood. You need to hurry up and treat it!]</p>
<p>“Yeah. I’ll leave it to you.”</p>
<p>Losing an arm is a pretty cheap price to pay in killing Evil Queen, even if she only had half her strength. His physical balance is off, but he will get used to it. There is no trouble for him to fight with his right arm. He won’t be as good as he was before, but he will be able to take on level 8.</p>
<p>Wiing.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung took off his battlesuit.</p>
<p>Odin set up medical supplies and treated him. Repair robots worked on the battlesuit.</p>
<p>[Are you planning on going to South America?]</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>There is something uncomfortable about it.</p>
<p>He killed Evil Queen, but it doesn’t feel like he did.</p>
<p>This is a bonus life. He intends to go since it doesn’t matter when he dies.</p>
<p>“I’ll take a look at Bon Load if I get the chance, too.”</p>
<p>He’s never run into a Lifer who has seen Bon Load.</p>
<p>There are only a lot of rumors.</p>
<p>They are rumors spread by Evil Queen. He took him on with Black Lord in the future, but he didn’t get to see Bon Load with his own eyes.</p>
<p>“I’m sure he exists somewhere.”</p>
<p>Six Disasters.</p>
<p>They may not know, but the supervisors will.</p>
<p>They are monsters in the game. There’s no reason for them to play games with them.</p>
<p>Cha Jun Sung closed his eyes as he thought. He tried to stay awake, but it was too hard. He gave in to his instincts to just let it be. Odin watched the vicinity with the battlesuit, and aided in Cha Jun Sung’s recovery.</p>
<p>...</p>
<p>Chapter 250</p>
<p>A vast jungle full of lush trees.</p>
<p>It is the Amazon crossing through South America. The place called the Earth’s lungs.</p>
<p>As a place where virus A runs rampant, it is now a paradise for mutants. Though it is a large habitat for mutants, it has become more beautiful ever since the man-made environmental destruction disappeared.</p>
<p>Whole forests and trees do not become monsters just because they are contaminated with virus A. It is just that the outside is fine and the inside has changed.</p>
<p>A secluded area of the Amazon.</p>
<p>Uplands that are higher than average. There are unnatural structures that create a large clearing.</p>
<p>“The other is dead. It hasn’t been long since it was sent out, but it’s already dead? Even if it is weaker, it should be as strong as Vanessa.”</p>
<p>A naked woman laying on a roughly carved altar.</p>
<p>She looks similar to the human version of Evil Queen that Cha Jun Sung killed in Mexico.</p>
<p>No, she’s the same. She must be. She is South America’s Evil Queen herself. The one here is the main body and the one she sent out is an alter ego.</p>
<p>The two are tied with kind of telepathy. There is no way to explain the principle behind it, but Evil Queen felt the alter ego’s death from a signal. The alter ego shouldn’t be underestimated. It held half of the main body’s strength.</p>
<p>Even Vanessa would have to risk death.</p>
<p>Evil Queen shifts her position.</p>
<p>She is deep in thought. The altar she is laying on was originally the Natives’ tombs. It is like a sanctuary. Of course there are no Natives. They are all dead.</p>
<p>Though they can live with the forest as friends, humans are just humans. They cannot live in a hell with masses of mutants.</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do if the puppet dies? My plans are ruined.”</p>
<p>Evil Queen grumbles.</p>
<p>She speaks in jest as if she doesn’t care, but it is a serious matter. It will take time to get out of here.</p>
<p>It would take least a few years, maybe many times more.</p>
<p>She needs to cover the eyes of the 4 sisters and other Disasters until then, but it has been ruined from the start.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, it has been quite a while since she has heard from the 4 sisters. She isn’t completely sure of their state, but it seems they died like the alter ego.</p>
<p>“Hm. What is this?”</p>
<p>Evil Queen didn’t feel sadness from the death of the 4 sisters.</p>
<p>It was a pity.</p>
<p>Children are precious to mutants as well.</p>
<p>But where there are those who are tied with affection, there are those like Evil Queen who are unconcerned.</p>
<p>The death of the 4 sisters and her alter ego are along the similar vein.</p>
<p>“Since I can’t move now, I’ll shrink.”</p>
<p>The time she needs is the time to transcend completion. She is going through that process now, albeit slowly.</p>
<p>“Anyway, that means there are five combining my daughters and alter ego. Does that mean those Lifers have developed that much? It’s dangerous. It’s different from what I’ve heard.”</p>
<p>Though Evil Queen is a mutant, it isn’t hard to find out information on Lifers. When she caught a few and asked, they told her everything.</p>
<p>It is just pure curiosity.</p>
<p>Humans hunting mutants?</p>
<p>It became the opposite. This thing called Life Mission is similar to a game she used to play as a human when she got bored. That’s why she was able to understand the principle behind it easily.</p>
<p>Whether it was a single person or a group, it doesn’t matter. If they have the ability to kill Vanessa and her alter ego, she needs to keep an eye on it.</p>
<p>“It’ll be boring until I get out, but what can I do? Right honey?”</p>
<p>Evil Queen talks to herself.</p>
<p>She is alone, but she is using an expression used to speak to a lover. The only honey Evil Queen has is Bon Load.</p>
<p>The pieces of bone wrapped around Evil Queen like an armor respond to her call. They are like tree roots. Some even dug into her skin. Disgusting foreign matter is scattered all over Evil Queen’s white and soft skin like veins.</p>
<p>“It’s curious that something like you exists.”</p>
<p>Something that formed from nothing.</p>
<p>That is Bon Load.</p>
<p>Evil Queen saw something like this for the first time as well.</p>
<p>He is a living thing, but it’s hard to say that he is a living thing.</p>
<p>Bon Load was born out of the graves where the Natives’ corpses were gathered.</p>
<p>Right here.</p>
<p>He is spread wide here like tree roots.</p>
<p>His personality is on the quiet side, but that doesn’t mean he’s gentle.</p>
<p>If he feels a threat on his life, these pieces of bone gather and create a form that can go into battle.</p>
<p>It is another interesting ability that is separate from full body mutation.</p>
<p>He has reason, but he cannot express himself freely like Evil Queen can. But he’s still strong. Of all the mutants that Evil Queen has seen, he is second to Black Lord.</p>
<p>He must have been born with the advantage of strength and the disadvantage of unclear reason because he wasn’t born normally.</p>
<p>Evil Queen was able to find him through effort and coincidence. It is the result of thoroughly searching through the Amazon for strong mutants.</p>
<p>Since he is a powerful mutant, she was able to produce high quality children by mating with Bon Load. Even without having to consume all of her nutrients.</p>
<p>Bon Load is a giant lump of nutrients.</p>
<p>Like a plant, he gets energy from sunlight and from planting himself into the ground.</p>
<p>Because of this, there was little burden on Evil Queen even after giving birth to seven children.</p>
<p>“Give me more strength.”</p>
<p>Evil Queen didn’t come to have children.</p>
<p>She is trying to bring Bon Load out into the world through herself as a medium. He isn’t a parasitic type, but he is an unborn mutant so he could if he had a medium that could play a housing role.</p>
<p>“The world is becoming strange. There’s no meaning if we don’t get stronger.”</p>
<p>Mutants and Lifers alike, there are enemies everywhere.</p>
<p>Before this happened, when law and order were destroyed as the world fell into pandemonium, the weak died no matter what. Strength was the only justice.</p>
<p>“Shall we try sleeping? The kids are watching the area nearby.”</p>
<p>It will take a long time to get Bon Load out. It wouldn’t be short to humans, but for Evil Queen to whom sleeping itself is meaningless, it is just a moment.</p>
<p>The only two things she needs to handle are boredom and risks nearby.</p>
<p>The three brothers born through her mating with Bon Load are guarding the vicinity. There is a pretty large distribution of mutants as well, so there’s no need to worry.</p>
<p>They can rest because finding the location is a problem and she has left several devices in place.</p>
<p>Evil Queen’s breathing becomes constant.</p>
<p>That is how the world came to face a catastrophe without knowing it. The first start began in Africa.</p>
<p>***</p>
<p>Living things have feelings. Whether the subject is superior or not.</p>
<p>How would it be if the same routine was repeated every day?</p>
<p>It would be boring.</p>
<p>A human would be able to express that boredom, but a bug cannot express it even if it feels that boredom.</p>
<p>But their abilities to feel boredom are the same.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Because they are living beings.</p>
<p>This is Africa’s Libya.</p>
<p>It has been several years since White Queen and Cruel King took their subordinate mutants and engaged in a total war in which they risked their lives.</p>
<p>White Queen did what she needed to do, took the seriously injured Titan and Medusa to Europe, and a few stayed behind in Africa.</p>
<p>Red Eye, Inferno, Blood Lord, and Beholder are the members left.</p>
<p>To stabilize the occupied territory?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>They aren’t staying for Africa, but because of the cocoon that hasn’t hatched for years.</p>
<p>They had thought that it would take a couple months at most. They didn’t know they would be waiting 10 times that.</p>
<p>They are about to ascend into boredom. The subordinates did nothing but hang out lazily, but the four of them took turns standing guard over the cocoon.</p>
<p>There was nothing they could do.</p>
<p>The cocoon was strong at first, but it was about enough to be able to take the four of them on if they combine their strength.</p>
<p>But as time went on, it surpassed that and had now reached the peak. They can’t help but be nervous.</p>
<p>Beholder, who can calculate its strength, said a few days ago,</p>
<p>‘If that wakes up and has other thoughts, everyone needs to run away.’</p>
<p>What could that mean?</p>
<p>It means they can’t win. The four of them are a pretty good mix.</p>
<p>Though it would have been better if Blood Lord had left and Medusa had come in.</p>
<p>They can’t communicate with him because he leans more toward his instincts than reason. He is stubborn. When it is his turn to watch the cocoon, he pushes that duty onto subordinate mutants and goes around Africa to play.</p>
<p>Red Eye is also a mutant with personality, but he faithfully completed his duty because he can be reasoned with.</p>
<p>The showy gold cocoon swelled and shrank repeatedly over several years, and has settled into a fixed size for some time now. The color is also getting more concentrated, so it looks like it will give off light. And the outer coat has become taught like a balloon, so it looks like it will hatch at any time.</p>
<p>‘Stay alert. It’ll hatch within a few weeks. Be ready to run away since we don’t know what will happen.’</p>
<p>Beholder used his telepathic abilities to estimate when the cocoon would hatch. It isn’t exact, but he said the margin of error would be give or take about a week.</p>
<p>It isn’t a joke when he tells them to run away.</p>
<p>They don’t know if it will be Cruel King or Parasite King, but the energy coming from it feels pure and clean.</p>
<p>That’s how Beholder reads it.</p>
<p>It is more accurate to say that he read the energy.</p>
<p>Being pure isn’t just good.</p>
<p>It is ambiguous. It is like a baby.</p>
<p>It can be influenced to anything. As they waited in worry and expectation, the hatching period approached.</p>
